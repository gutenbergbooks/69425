<p>The cover image has been created by the transcriber, and is placed in the public domain.</p>

<p>Variant spelling, inconsistent hyphenation, punctuation and spelling
are retained, however a few changes have been made to correct apparent
errors, these are described in the <a href="#tn_end">note</a> at the end of the book.</p>

<p>The characters “u”, “v”; and “i”, “j” have been left as printed, even where they are not used consistently. “ſ” characters have been changed to “s” throughout.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>A<span class="looks_big">l</span>though the ancient Heathens did appropriate the first
inuention of the knowledge of Herbes, and so consequently
of physicke, some vnto <span class="plain">Chiron</span> the Centaure,
and others vnto <span class="plain">Apollo</span> or <span class="plain">Æsculapius</span> his sonne; yet
wee that are Christians haue out of a better Schoole
learned, that God, the Creator of Heauen and Earth,
at the beginning when he created <span class="plain">Adam</span>, inspired him
with the knowledge of all naturall things (which
successiuely descended to <span class="plain">Noah</span> afterwardes, and to his
Posterity): for, as he was able to giue names to all the liuing Creatures, according
to their seuerall natures; so no doubt but hee had also the knowledge, both what
Herbes and Fruits were fit, eyther for Meate or Medicine, for Vse or for Delight.
And that <span class="plain">Adam</span> might exercise this knowledge, God planted a Garden for him to
liue in, (wherein euen in his innocency he was to labour and spend his time) which
hee stored with the best and choysest Herbes and Fruits the earth could produce,
that he might haue not onely for necessitie whereon to feede, but for pleasure also;
the place or garden called Paradise importing as much, and more plainly the words
set downe in <span class="plain"><cite>Genesis</cite></span> the second, which are these; <span class="plain">Out of the ground the Lord
God made to grow euerie tree pleasant to the sight and good for meate</span>;
and in the <cite>24. of <span class="plain">Numbers</span></cite>, the Parable of Balaam, mentioning the Aloe trees
that God planted; and in other places if there were neede to recite them. But my
purpose is onely to shew you, that Paradise was a place (whether you will call it a
Garden, or Orchard, or both, no doubt of some large extent) wherein <span class="plain">Adam</span> was
first placed to abide; that God was the Planter thereof, hauing furnished it with
trees and herbes, as well pleasant to the sight, as good for meate, and that hee being
to dresse and keepe this place, must of necessity know all the things that grew therein,
and to what vses they serued, or else his labour about them, and knowledge in
them, had been in vaine. And although <span class="plain">Adam</span> lost the place for his transgression,
yet he lost not the naturall knowledge, nor vse of them: but that, as God made the
whole world, and all the Creatures therein for Man, so hee may vse all things as
well of pleasure as of necessitie, to bee helpes vnto him to serue his God. Let men
therefore, according to their first institution, so vse their seruice, that they also in
them may remember their seruice to God, and not (like our Grand-mother <span class="plain">Eve</span>)
set their affections so strongly, on the pleasure in them, as to deserue the losse of them
in this Paradise, yea and of Heauen also. For truly from all sorts of Herbes and
Flowers we may draw matter at all times not only to magnifie the Creator that hath
giuen them such diuersities of forms, sents and colours, that the most cunning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_f">[f]</a></span>
Worke-man cannot imitate, and such vertues and properties, that although wee
know many, yet many more lye hidden and vnknowne, but many good instructions
also to our selues: That as many herbes and flowers with their fragrant sweete
smels doe comfort, and as it were reuiue the spirits, and perfume a whole house;
euen so such men as liue vertuously, labouring to doe good, and profit the Church of
God and the Common wealth by their paines or penne, doe as it were send forth a
pleasing savour of sweet instructions, not only to that time wherein they liue, and
are fresh, but being drye, withered and dead, cease not in all after ages to doe as
much or more. Many herbes and flowers that haue small beautie or savour to commend
them, haue much more good vse and vertue: so many men of excellent rare
parts and good qualities doe lye hid unknown and not respected, vntill time and vse
of them doe set forth their properties. Againe, many flowers haue a glorious shew
of beauty and brauery, yet stinking in smell, or else of no other vse: so many
doe make a glorious ostentation, and flourish in the world, when as if they stinke
not horribly before God, and all good men, yet surely they haue no other vertue then
their outside to commend them, or leaue behind them. Some also rise vp and appear
like a Lilly among Thornes, or as a goodly Flower among many Weedes or Grasse,
eyther by their honourable authoritie, or eminence of learning or riches, whereby
they excell others, and thereby may doe good to many. The frailty also of Mans
life is learned by the soone fading of them before their flowring, or in their pride, or
soone after, being either cropt by the hand of the spectator, or by a sudden blast withered
and parched, or by the reuolution of time decaying of it owne nature: as
also that the fairest flowers or fruits first ripe, are soonest and first gathered. The
mutabilitie also of states and persons, by this, that as where many goodly flowers
&amp; fruits did grow this years and age, in another they are quite pulled or digged vp,
and eyther weedes and grasse grow in their place, or some building erected thereon,
and their place is no more known. The Ciuill respects to be learned from them are
many also: for the delight of the varieties both of formes, colours and properties
of Herbes and Flowers, hath euer beene powerfull ouer dull, unnurtured, rusticke
and sauage people, led only by Natures instinct; how much, more powerfull is it, or
should be in the mindes of generous persons? for it may well bee said, he is not humane,
that is not allured with this obiect. The study, knowledge, and trauel in them,
as they haue been entertained of great Kings, Princes and Potentates, without disparagement
to their Greatnesse, or hinderance to their more serious and weighty
Affaires: so no doubt vnto all that are capable thereof, it is not onely pleasant, but
profitable, by comforting the minde, spirits and senses with an harmelesse delight,
and by enabling the iudgement to conferre and apply helpe to many dangerous diseases.
It is also an Instructer in the verity of the genuine Plants of the Ancients,
and a Correcter of the many errours whereunto the world by continuance hath bin
diuerted, and almost therein fixed, by eradicating in time, and by degrees, the pertinacious
wilfulnesse of many, who because they were brought vp in their errours, are
most vnwilling to leaue them without consideration of the good or euill, the right or
wrong, they draw on therewith. And for my selfe I may well say, that had not mine
owne paines and studies by a naturall inclination beene more powerfull in mee then
any others helpe (although some through an euill disposition and ignorance haue so
far traduced me as to say this was rather another mans worke then mine owne, but
I leaue them to their folly) I had neuer done so much as I here publish; nor been fit
or prepared for a larger, as time may suddenly (by Gods permission) bring to light, if
the maleuolent dispositions of degenerate spirits doe not hinder the accomplishment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_g">[g]</a></span>
But perswading my selfe there is no showre that produceth not some fruit, or no
word but worketh some effect, eyther of good to perswade, or of reproofe to euince;
I could not but declare my minde herein, let others iudge or say what they please.
For I haue alwaies held it a thing vnfit, to conceale or bury that knowledge God
hath giuen, and not to impart it, and further others therewith as much as is conuenient,
yet without ostentation, which I haue euer hated. Now further to informe
the courteous Reader, both of the occasion that led me on to this worke, and the
other occurrences to it. First, hauing perused many Herbals in Latine, I obserued
that most of them haue eyther neglected or not knowne the many diuersities of the
flower Plants, and rare fruits are known to vs at this time, and (except <span class="plain">Clusius</span>)
haue made mention but of a very few. In English likewise we haue some extant,
as <span class="plain">Turner</span> and <span class="plain">Dodonæus</span> translated, who haue said little of Flowers, <span class="plain">Gerard</span>
who is last, hath no doubt giuen vs the knowledge of as many as he attained vnto
in his time, but since his daies we haue had many more varieties, then he or they euer
heard of, as may be perceiued by the store I haue here produced. And none of them
haue particularly seuered those that are beautifull flower plants, fit to store a garden
of delight and pleasure, from the wilde and vnfit: but haue enterlaced many,
one among another, whereby many that haue desired to haue faire flowers, haue not
known eyther what to choose, or what to desire. Diuers Bookes of Flowers also haue
been set forth, some in our owne Countrey, and more in others, all which are as it
were but handfuls snatched from the plentifull Treasury of Nature, none of them
being willing or able to open all sorts, and declare them fully; but the greatest
hinderance of all mens delight was, that none of them had giuen any description of
them, but the bare name only. To satisfie therefore their desires that are louers
of such Delights, I took vpon me this labour and charge, and haue here selected and
set forth a Garden of all the chiefest for choyce, and fairest for shew, from among
all the seuerall Tribes and Kindreds of Natures beauty, and haue ranked them as
neere as I could, or as the worke would permit, in affinity one vnto another. Secondly,
and for their sakes that are studious in Authors, I haue set down the names haue
bin formerly giuen vnto them, with some of their errours, not intending to cumber
this worke with all that might bee said of them, because the deciding of the many
controuersies, doubts, and questions that concerne them, pertaine more fitly to a generall
History: yet I haue beene in some places more copious and ample then at the
first I had intended, the occasion drawing on my desire to informe others with what
I thought was fit to be known, reseruing what else might be said to another time &amp;
worke; wherein (God willing) I will inlarge my selfe, the subiect matter requiring
it at my hands, in what my small ability can effect. Thirdly, I haue also to embellish
this Worke set forth the figures of all such plants and flowers as are materiall and
different one from another: but not as some others haue done, that is, a number of
the figures of one sort of plant that haue nothing to distinguish them but the colour,
for that I hold to be superfluous and waste. Fourthly, I haue also set down the
Vertues and Properties of them in a briefe manner, rather desiring to giue you the
knowledge of a few certaine and true, then to relate, as others haue done, a needless
and false multiplicitie, that so there might as well profit as pleasure be taken from
them, and that nothing might be wanting to accomplish it fully. And so much for
this first part, my Garden of pleasant and delightfull Flowers. My next Garden
consisteth of Herbes and Rootes, fit to be eaten of the rich and poor as nourishment
and food, as sawce or condiment, as sallet or refreshing, for pleasure or profit; where
I doe as well play the Gardiner, to shew you (in briefe, but not at large) the times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_h">[h]</a></span>
and manner of sowing, setting, planting, replanting, and the like (although all
these things, and many more then are true, are set down very largely in the seuerall
bookes that others haue written of this subiect) as also to shew some of the Kitchen
vses (because they are Kitchen herbes <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>) although I confesse but very sparingly,
not intending a treatise of cookery, but briefly to giue a touch thereof; and
also the Physicall properties, to shew some what that others haue not set forth; yet
not to play the Empericke, and giue you receipts of medicines for all diseases, but
only to shew in some sort the qualities of Herbes, to quicken the minds of the studious.
And lastly an Orchard of all sorts of domesticke or forraine, rare and good
fruits, fit for this our Land and Countrey, which is at this time better stored and
furnished then euer in any age before. I haue herein endeauoured, as in the other
Gardens, to set forth the varieties of euery sort in as briefe a manner as possibly
could be, without superfluous repetitions of descriptions, and onely with especiall
notes of difference in leaues, flowers and fruits. Some few properties also are set
downe, rather the chiefest then the most, as the worke did require. And moreouer
before euery of these parts I haue giuen Treatises of the ordering, preparing and
keeping the seuerall Gardens and Orchard, with whatsoeuer I thought was conuenient
to be known for euery of them.</i></p>

<p><i>Thus haue I shewed you both the occasion and scope of this Worke, and herein
haue spent my time, paines and charge, which if well accepted, I shall thinke well
employed, and may the sooner hasten the fourth Part, A Garden of Simples; which
will be quiet no longer at home, then that it can bring his Master newes of faire
weather for the iourney.</i></p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" alt="T">
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e  seuerall situations of mens dwellings, are for the most part
vnauoideable and vnremoueable; for most men cannot appoint
forth such a manner of situation for their dwelling, as is most fit
to auoide all the inconueniences of winde and weather, but must
bee content with such as the place will afford them; yet all men
doe well know, that some situations are more excellent than others:
according therfore to the seuerall situation of mens dwellings,
so are the situations of their gardens also for the most part.
And although diuers doe diuersly preferre their owne seuerall places which they haue
chosen, or wherein they dwell; As some those places that are neare vnto a riuer or
brooke to be best for the pleasantnesse of the water, the ease of transportation of themselues,
their friends and goods, as also for the fertility of the soyle, which is seldome
bad neare vnto a riuers side; And others extoll the side or top of an hill, bee it small or
great, for the prospects sake; And againe, some the plaine or champian ground, for
the euen leuell thereof: euery one of which, as they haue their commodities accompanying
them, so haue they also their discommodities belonging vnto them, according to
the Latine Prouerbe, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omne commodum fert suum incommodum</i>. Yet to shew you for euerie
of these situations which is the fittest place to plant your garden in, and how to defend
it from the iniuries of the cold windes and frosts that may annoy it, will, I hope, be
well accepted. And first, for the water side, I suppose the North side of the water to
be the best side for your garden, that it may haue the comfort of the South Sunne to lye
vpon it and face it, and the dwelling house to bee aboue it, to defend the cold windes
and frosts both from your herbes, and flowers, and early fruits. And so likewise I
iudge for the hill side, that it may lye full open to the South Sunne, and, the house aboue
it, both for the comfort the ground shall receiue of the water and raine descending into
it, and of defence from winter and colds. Now for the plaine leuell ground, the buildings
of the house should be on the North side of the garden, that so they might bee a
defence of much sufficiency to safeguard it from many iniurious cold nights and dayes,
which else might spoyle the pride thereof in the bud. But because euery one cannot so
appoint his dwelling, as I here appoint the fittest place for it to be, euery ones pleasure
thereof shall be according to the site, cost, and endeauours they bestow, to cause it come
nearest to this proportion, by such helpes of bricke or stone wals to defend it, or by the
helpe of high growne and well spread trees, planted on the North side thereof, to keepe
it the warmer. And euery of these three situations, hauing the fairest buildings of the
house facing the garden in this manner before specified, besides the benefit of shelter it
shall haue from them, the buildings and roomes abutting thereon, shall haue reciprocally
the beautifull prospect into it, and haue both sight and sent of whatsoeuer is excellent,
and worthy to giue content out of it, which is one of the greatest pleasures a
garden can yeeld his Master. Now hauing shewed you the best place where this your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
garden should be, let me likewise aduise you where it should not be, at least that it is the
worst place wherein it may be, if it be either on the West or East side of your house, or
that it stand in a moorish ground, or other vnwholsome ayre (for many, both fruits,
herbes, and flowers that are tender, participate with the ayre, taking in a manner their
chiefest thriuing from thence) or neare any common Lay-stalles, or common Sewers,
or else neare any great Brew-house, Dye-house, or any other place where there is much
smoake, whether it be of straw, wood, or especially of sea-coales, which of all other is
the worst, as our Citie of London can giue proofe sufficient, wherein neither herbe nor
tree will long prosper, nor hath done euer since the vse of sea-coales beganne to bee frequent
therein. And likewise that it is much the worse, if it bee neare vnto any Barnes or
Stackes of corne or hey, because that from thence will continually with the winde bee
brought into the garden the strawe and chaffe of the corne, the dust and seede of the hey
to choake or pester it. Next vnto the place or situation, let mee shew you the grounds
or soyles for it, eyther naturall or artificiall. No man will deny, but the naturall blacke
mould is not only the fattest and richest, but farre exceedeth any other either naturall or
artificiall, as well in goodnesse as durability. And next thereunto, I hold the sandy loame
(which is light and yet firme, but not loose as sand, nor stiffe like vnto clay) to be little
inferiour for this our Garden of pleasure; for that it doth cause all bulbous and tuberous
rooted plants to thriue sufficiently therein, as likewise all other flower-plants,
Roses, Trees, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> which if it shall decay by much turning and working out the heart of
it, may soone be helped with old stable manure of horses, being well turned in, when it
is old and almost conuerted to mould. Other grounds, as chalke, sand, grauell, or clay,
are euery of them one more or lesse fertill or barren than other; and therefore doe require
such helpes as is most fit for them. And those grounds that are ouer dry, loose, and
dustie, the manure of stall fedde beasts and cattell being buried or trenched into the
earth, and when it is thorough rotten (which will require twice the time that the stable
soyle of horses will) well turned and mixed with the earth, is the best soyle to temper
both the heate and drinesse of them. So contrariwise the stable dung of horses is the best
for cold grounds, to giue them heate and life. But of all other sorts of grounds, the stiffe
clay is the very worst for this purpose; for that although you should digge out the whole
compasse of your Garden, carry it away, and bring other good mould in the stead thereof,
and fill vp the place, yet the nature of that clay is so predominant, that in a small time
it will eate out the heart of the good mould, and conuert it to its owne nature, or very
neare vnto it: so that to bring it to any good, there must bee continuall labour bestowed
thereon, by bringing into it good store of chalke, lime, or sand, or else ashes eyther of
wood or of sea-coales (which is the best for this ground) well mixed and turned in with
it. And as this stiffe clay is the worst, so what ground soeuer commeth nearest vnto the
nature thereof, is neared vnto it in badnesse, the signes whereof are the ouermuch moysture
thereof in Winter, and the much cleaning and chapping thereof in Summer, when
the heate of the yeare hath consumed the moysture, which tyed and bound it fast together,
as also the stiffe and hard working therein: but if the nature of the clay bee not too
stiffe, but as it were tempered and mixed with sand or other earths, your old stable
soyle of horses will helpe well the small rifting or chapping thereof, to be plentifully
bestowed therin in a fit season. Some also do commend the casting of ponds and ditches,
to helpe to manure these stiffe chapping grounds. Other grounds, that are ouermoist by
springs, that lye too neare the vpper face of the earth, besides that the beds thereof had
need to be laid vp higher, and the allies, as trenches and furrowes, to lye lower, the
ground it selfe had neede to haue some good store of chalke-stones bestowed thereon,
some certaine yeares, if it may be, before it be laid into a Garden, that the Winter frosts
may breake the chalke small, and the Raine dissolue it into mould, that so they may bee
well mixed together; than which, there is not any better manure to soyle such a moist
ground, to helpe to dry vp the moysture, and to giue heate and life to the coldnesse
thereof, which doth alwayes accompany these moist grounds, and also to cause it abide
longer in heart than any other. For the sandy and grauelly grounds, although I know
the well mollified manure of beasts and cattell to be excellent good, yet I know also, that
some commend a white Marle, and some a clay to be well spread thereon, and after turned
thereinto: and for the chalkie ground, <i>è conuerso</i>, I commend fatte clay to helpe it.
You must vnderstand, that the lesse rich or more barren that your ground is, there nee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>deth
the more care, labour, and cost to bee bestowed thereon, both to order it rightly,
&amp; so to preserue it from time to time: for no artificiall or forc’t ground can endure good
any long time, but that within a few yeares it must be refreshed more or lesse, according
as it doth require. Yet you shall likewise vnderstand, that this Garden of pleasure stored
with these Out-landish flowers; that is, bulbous and tuberous rooted plants, and other
fine flowers, that I haue hereafter described, and assigned vnto it, needeth not so much
or so often manuring with soyle, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> as another Garden planted with the other sorts of
English flowers, or a Garden of ordinary Kitchin herbes doth. Your ground likewise
for this Garden had neede to bee well cleansed from all annoyances (that may hinder
the well doing or prospering of the flowers therein) as stones, weedes, rootes of trees,
bushes, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and all other things cumbersome or hurtfull; and therefore the earth being
not naturally fine enough of it selfe, is vsed to bee fitted to make it the finer, and that
either through a hurdle made of sticks, or lathes, or through square or round sieues platted
with fine and strong thin stickes, or with wyers in the bottome. Or else the whole
earth of the Garden being course, may be cast in the same manner that men vse to try or
fine sand from grauell, that is, against a wall; whereby the courser and more stony, falling
downe from the fine, is to be taken away from the foote of the heape, the finer sand
and ground remaining still aboue, and on the heape. Or else in the want of a wall to cast
it against, I haue seene earth fined by it selfe in this manner: Hauing made the floore or
vpper part of a large plat of ground cleane from stones, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> let there a reasonable round
heape of fine earth be set in the midst thereof, or in stead thereof a large Garden flowerpot,
or other great pot, the bottome turned vpwards, and then poure your course earth
on the top or head thereof, one shouell full after another somewhat gently, and thereby
all the course stuffe and stones will fall downe to the bottome round about the heape,
which must continually be carefully taken away, and thus you may make your earth as
fine as if it were cast against a wall, the heape being growne great, seruing in stead thereof.
Those that will not prepare their grounds in some of these manners aforesaid, shall
soone finde to their losse the neglect thereof: for the trash and stones shall so hinder the
encrease of their roots, that they will be halfe lost in the earth among the stones, which
else might be saued to serue to plant wheresoeuer they please.</p>

<i class="sub-title">The frame or forme of a Garden of delight and pleasure, with the seuerall
varieties thereof.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">A<span class="looks_big">l</span>though many men must be content with any plat of ground, of what forme or
quantity soeuer it bee, more or lesse, for their Garden, because a more large or
conuenient cannot bee had to their habitation: Yet I perswade my selfe, that
Gentlemen of the better sort and quality, will prouide such a parcell of ground to bee
laid out for their Garden, and in such conuenient manner, as may be fit and answerable
to the degree they hold. To prescribe one forme for euery man to follow, were too
great presumption and folly: for euery man will please his owne fancie, according to
the extent he designeth out for that purpose, be it orbicular or round, triangular or three
square, quadrangular or foure square, or more long than broad. I will onely shew you
here the seuerall formes that many men haue taken and delighted in, let euery man chuse
which him liketh best, or may most fitly agree to that proportion of ground hee hath set
out for that purpose. The orbicular or round forme is held in it owne proper existence,
to be the most absolute forme, containing within it all other formes whatsoeuer; but few
I thinke will chuse such a proportion to be ioyned to their habitation, being not accepted
any where I think, but for the generall Garden to the Vniuersity at Padoa. The triangular
or three square is such a forme also, as is seldome chosen by any that may make
another choise, and as I thinke is onely had where another forme cannot be had, necessitie
constraining them to be therewith content. The foure square forme is the most vsually
accepted with all, and doth best agree to any mans dwelling, being (as I said before)
behinde the house, all the backe windowes thereof opening into it. Yet if it bee longer
than the breadth, or broader than the length, the proportion of walkes, squares, and
knots may be soon brought to the square forme, and be so cast, as the beauty thereof may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
bee no lesse than the foure square proportion, or any other better forme, if any be. To
forme it therfore with walks, crosse the middle both waies, and round about it also with
hedges, with squares, knots and trayles, or any other worke within the foure square
parts, is according as euery mans conceit alloweth of it, and they will be at the charge:
For there may be therein walkes eyther open or close, eyther publike or priuate, a maze
or wildernesse, a rocke or mount, with a fountaine in the midst thereof to conuey water
to euery part of the Garden, eyther in pipes vnder the ground, or brought by hand, and
emptied into large Cisternes or great Turkie Iarres, placed in conuenient places, to
serue as an ease to water the nearest parts thereunto. Arbours also being both gracefull
and necessary, may be appointed in such conuenient places, as the corners, or else where,
as may be most fit, to serue both for shadow and rest after walking. And because many
are desirous to see the formes of trayles, knots, and other compartiments, and because
the open knots are more proper for these Out-landish flowers; I haue here caused some
to be drawne, to satisfie their desires, not intending to cumber this worke with ouer manie,
in that it would be almost endlesse, to expresse so many as might bee conceiued and
set downe, for that euery man may inuent others farre differing from these, or any other
can be set forth. Let euery man therefore, if hee like of these, take what may please his
mind, or out of these or his own conceit, frame any other to his fancy, or cause others to
be done as he liketh best, obseruing this <i>decorum</i>, that according to his ground he do cast
out his knots, with conuenient roome for allies and walkes; for the fairer and larger your
allies and walkes be, the more grace your Garden shall haue, the lesse harme the herbes
and flowers shall receiue, by passing by them that grow next vnto the allies sides, and the
better shall your Weeders cleanse both the beds and the allies.</p>

<i class="sub-title">The many sorts of herbes and other things, wherewith the beds and parts of knots are bordered
to set out the forme of them, with their commodities and discommodities.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">I<span class="looks_big">t</span> is necessary also, that I shew you the seuerall materials, wherewith these knots and
trayles are set forth and bordered; which are of two sorts: The one are liuing
herbes, and the other are dead materials; as leade, boords, bones, tyles, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Of
herbes, there are many sorts wherewith the knots and beds in a Garden are vsed to bee
set, to shew forth the forme of them, and to preserue them the longer in their forme, as
also to be as greene, and sweete herbes, while they grow, to be cut to perfume the house,
keeping them in such order and proportion, as may be most conuenient for their seuerall
natures, and euery mans pleasure and fancy: Of all which, I intend to giue you the
knowledge here in this place; and first, to begin with that which hath beene most anciently
receiued, which is Thrift. This is an euerliuing greene herbe, which many take to
border their beds, and set their knots and trayles, and therein much delight, because it
will grow thicke and bushie, and may be kept, being cut with a paire of Garden sheeres,
in some good handsome manner and proportion for a time, and besides, in the Summer
time send forth many short stalkes of pleasant flowers, to decke vp an house among other
sweete herbes: Yet these inconueniences doe accompany it; it will not onely in a
small time ouergrow the knot or trayle in many places, by growing so thicke and bushie,
that it will put out the forme of a knot in many places: but also much thereof will dye
with the frosts and snowes in Winter, and with the drought in Summer, whereby many
voide places will be seene in the knot, which doth much deforme it, and must therefore
bee yearely refreshed: the thicknesse also and bushing thereof doth hide and shelter
snayles and other small noysome wormes so plentifully, that Gilloflowers, and other
fine herbes and flowers being planted therein, are much spoyled by them, and cannot be
helped without much industry, and very great and daily attendance to destroy them.
Germander is another herbe, in former times also much vsed, and yet also in many places;
and because it will grow thicke, and may be kept also in some forme and proportion
with cutting, and that the cuttings are much vsed as a strawing herbe for houses, being
pretty and sweete, is also much affected by diuers: but this also will often dye and grow
out of forme, and besides that, the stalkes will grow too great, hard and stubby, the
rootes doe so farre shoote vnder ground, that, vpon a little continuance thereof, will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
spread into many places within the knot, which if continually they be not plucked vp,
they will spoile the whole knot it selfe; and therefore once in three or foure yeares at the
most, it must be taken vp and new set, or else it will grow too roynish and cumbersome.
Hyssope hath also been vsed to be set about a knot, and being sweete, will serue for strewings,
as Germander: But this, although the rootes doe not runne or creep like it, yet the
stalkes doe quickly grow great aboue ground, and dye often after the first yeares setting,
whereby the grace of the knot will be much lost. Marierome, Sauorie, and Thyme, in
the like manner being sweete herbes, are vsed to border vp beds and knots, and will be
kept for a little while, with cutting, into some conformity; but all and euery of them
serve most commonly but for one yeares vse, and will soone decay and perish: and
therefore none of these, no more than any of the former, doe I commend for a good
bordering herbe for this purpose. Lauander Cotton also being finely slipped and set, is
of many, and those of the highest respect of late daies, accepted, both for the beauty and
forme of the herbe, being of a whitish greene mealy colour, for his sent smelling somewhat
strong, and being euerliuing and abiding greene all the Winter, will, by cutting, be
kept in as euen proportion as any other herbe may be. This will likewise soone grow
great and stubbed, notwithstanding the cutting, and besides will now and then perish in
some places, especially if you doe not strike or put off the snow, before the Sunne lying
vpon it dissolue it: The rarity &amp; nouelty of this herbe, being for the most part but in the
Gardens of great persons, doth cause it to be of the greater regard, it must therfore be renewed
wholly euery second or third yeare at the most, because of the great growing
therof. Slips of Iuniper or Yew are also receiued of some &amp; planted, because they are alwayes
green, and that the Iuniper especially hath not that ill sent that Boxe hath, which
I will presently commend vnto you, yet both Iuniper and Yew will soon grow too great
and stubbed, and force you to take vp your knot sooner, than if it were planted with
Boxe. Which lastly, I chiefly and aboue all other herbes commend vnto you, and being
a small, lowe, or dwarfe kinde, is called French or Dutch Boxe, and serueth very well
to set out any knot, or border out any beds: for besides that it is euer greene, it being
reasonable thicke set, will easily be cut and formed into any fashion one will, according
to the nature thereof, which is to grow very slowly, and will not in a long time rise to be
of any height, but shooting forth many small branches from the roote, will grow very
thicke, and yet not require so great tending, nor so much perish as any of the former, and
is onely receiued into the Gardens of those that are curious. This (as I before said) I
commend and hold to bee the best and surest herbe to abide faire and greene in all the
bitter stormes of the sharpest Winter, and all the great heates and droughts of Summer,
and doth recompence the want of a good sweet sent with his fresh verdure, euen proportion,
and long lasting continuance. Yet these inconueniences it hath, that besides
the vnpleasing sent which many mislike, and yet is but small, the rootes of this Boxe do
so much spread themselues into the ground of the knot, and doe draw from thence so
much nourishment, that it robbeth all the herbes that grow neare it of their sap and substance,
thereby making all the earth about it barren, or at least lesse fertile. Wherefore
to shew you the remedy of this inconuenience of spreading, without either taking vp the
Boxe of the border, or the herbes and flowers in the knot, is I thinke a secret knowne
but vnto a few, which is this: You shall take a broad pointed Iron like vnto a Slise or
Chessill, which thrust downe right into the ground a good depth all along the inside of
the border of Boxe somewhat close thereunto, you may thereby cut away the spreading
rootes thereof, which draw so much moisture from the other herbes on the inside, and
by this meanes both preserue your herbes and flowers in the knot, and your Boxe also,
for that the Boxe will be nourished sufficiently from the rest of the rootes it shooteth on
all the other sides. And thus much for the liuing herbes, that serue to set or border vp
any knot. Now for the dead materials, they are also, as I said before diuers: as first,
Leade, which some that are curious doe border their knots withall, causing it to be cut
of the breadth of foure fingers, bowing the lower edge a little outward, that it may lye
vnder the vpper crust of the ground, and that it may stand the faster, and making the vpper
edge either plain, or cut out like vnto the battlements of a Church: this fashion hath
delighted some, who haue accounted it stately (at the least costly) and fit for their degree,
and the rather, because it will be bowed and bended into any round square, angular,
or other proportion as one listeth, and is not much to be misliked, in that the Leade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
doth not easily breake or spoile without much iniury, and keepeth vp a knot for a very
long time in his due proportion: but in my opinion, the Leade is ouer-hot for Summer,
and ouer-cold for Winter. Others doe take Oaken inch boords, and sawing them
foure or fiue inches broad, do hold vp their knot therewith: but in that these boordes
cannot bee drawne compasse into any small scantling, they must serue rather for long
outright beds, or such knots as haue no rounds, halfe rounds or compassings in them.
And besides, these boordes are not long lasting, because they stand continually in the
weather, especially the ends where they are fastened together will soonest rot and perish,
and so the whole forme will be spoyled. To preuent that fault, some others haue
chosen the shanke bones of Sheep, which after they haue beene well cleansed and
boyled, to take out the fat from them, are stucke into the ground the small end downewards,
and the knockle head vpwards, and thus being set side to side, or end to end
close together, they set out the whole knot therewith, which heads of bones although
they looke not white the first yeare, yet after they haue abiden some frosts and heates
will become white, and prettily grace out the ground: but this inconvenience is incident
to them, that the Winter frosts will raise them out of the ground oftentimes, and
if by chance the knockle head of any doe breake, or be strucke off with any ones foot,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> going by, from your store, that lyeth by you of the same sort, set another in the
place, hauing first taken away the broken peece: although these will last long in forme
and order, yet because they are but bones many mislike them, and indeed I know but
few that vse them. Tyles are also vsed by some, which by reason they may bee
brought compasse into any fashion many are pleased with them, who doe not take the
whole Tyle at length, but halfe Tyles, and other broken pieces set somewhat deepe,
into the ground, that they may stand fast, and these take vp but little roome, and keepe
vp the edge of the beds and knots in a pretty comely manner, but they are often out of
frame, in that many of them are broken and spoiled, both with mens feete passing by,
the weather and weight of the earth beating them downe and breaking them, but especially
the frosts in Winter doe so cracke off their edges, both at the toppes and
sides that stand close one vnto another, that they must be continually tended and repaired
with fresh and sound ones put in the place of them that are broken or decayed.
And lastly (for it is the latest inuention) round whitish or blewish pebble stones, of
some reasonable proportion and bignesse, neither too great nor too little, haue beene
vsed by some to be set, or rather in a manner but laide vpon the ground to fashion out
the traile or knot, or all along by the large grauelly walke sides to set out the walke, and
maketh a pretty handsome shew, and because the stones will not decay with the iniuries
of any time or weather, and will be placed in their places againe, if any should be
thrust out by any accident, as also that their sight is so conspicuous vpon the ground,
especially if they be not hid with the store of herbes growing in the knot; is accounted
both for durability, beauty of the sight, handsomnesse in the worke, and ease in the
working and charge, to be of all other dead materials the chiefest. And thus, Gentlemen,
I haue shewed you all the varieties that I know are vsed by any in our Countrey,
that are worth the reciting (but as for the fashion of Iawe-bones, vsed by some
in the Low Countries, and other places beyond the Seas, being too grosse and base, I
make no mention of them) among which euery one may take what pleaseth him best,
or may most fitly be had, or may best agree with the ground or knot. Moreouer, all
these herbes that serue for borderings, doe serue as well to be set vpon the ground of a
leuelled knot; that is, where the allies and foot-pathes are of the same leuell with the
knot, as they may serue also for the raised knot, that is, where the beds of the knot are
raised higher than the allies; but both Leade, Boordes, Bones, and Tyles, are only for
the raised ground, be it knot or beds. The pebble stones againe are onely for the leuelled
ground, because they are so shallow, that as I said before, they rather lye vpon
the earth than are thrust any way into it. All this that I haue here set downe, you must
vnderstand is proper for the knots alone of a Garden. But for to border the whole
square or knot about, to serue as a hedge thereunto, euery one taketh what liketh him
best; as either Priuet alone, or sweete Bryer, and white Thorne enterlaced together,
and Roses of one, or two, or more sorts placed here and there amongst them. Some
also take Lauander, Rosemary, Sage, Southernwood, Lauander Cotton, or some such
other thing. Some againe plant Cornell Trees, and plash them, or keepe them lowe, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
forme them into an hedge. And some againe take a lowe prickly shrubbe, that abideth
alwayes greene, described in <a href="#Page_604" title="go to page 604">the end of this Booke</a>, called in Latine <i>Pyracantha</i>, which
in time will make an euer greene hedge or border, and when it beareth fruit, which are
red berries like vnto Hawthorne berries, make a glorious shew among the greene leaues
in the Winter time, when no other shrubbes haue fruit or leaues.</p>

earlinesse, are to be planted in Gardens of pleasure for delight.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">H<span class="looks_big">a</span>ving thus formed out a Garden, and diuided it into his fit and due proportion,
with all the gracefull knots, arbours, walkes, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> likewise what is fit to
keepe it in the same comely order, is appointed vnto it, both for the borders of
the squares, and for the knots and beds themselues; let vs now come and furnish the
inward parts, and beds with those fine flowers that (being strangers vnto vs, and giuing
the beauty and brauery of their colours so early before many of our home bred flowers,
the more to entice vs to their delight) are most beseeming it; and namely, with Daffodils,
Fritillarias, Iacinthes, Saffron-flowers, Lillies, Flowerdeluces, Tulipas, Anemones,
French Cowslips, or Beares eares, and a number of such other flowers, very beautifull,
delightfull, and pleasant, hereafter described at full, whereof although many
haue little sweete scent to commend them, yet their earlinesse and exceeding great beautie
and varietie doth so farre counteruaile that defect (and yet I must tell you with all,
that there is among the many sorts of them some, and that not a few, that doe excell in
sweetnesse, being so strong and heady, that they rather offend by too much than by too
little sent, and some againe are of so milde and moderate temper, that they scarce come
short of your most delicate and daintiest flowers) that they are almost in all places with
all persons, especially with the better sort of the Gentry of the Land, as greatly desired
and accepted as any other the most choisest, and the rather, for that the most part of these
Out-landish flowers, do shew forth their beauty and colours so early in the yeare, that
they seeme to make a Garden of delight euen in the Winter time, and doe so giue their
flowers one after another, that all their brauery is not fully spent, vntil that Gilliflowers,
the pride of our English Gardens, do shew themselues: So that whosoeuer would haue
of euery sort of these flowers, may haue for euery moneth seueral colours and varieties,
euen from Christmas vntill Midsommer, or after; and then, after some little respite, vntill
Christmas againe, and that in some plenty, with great content and without forcing;
so that euery man may haue them in euery place, if they will take any care of them.
And because there bee many Gentlewomen and others, that would gladly haue some
fine flowers to furnish their Gardens, but know not what the names of those things are
that they desire, nor what are the times of their flowring, nor the skill and knowledge
of their right ordering, planting, displanting, transplanting, and replanting; I haue here
for their sakes set downe the nature, names, times, and manner of ordering in a briefe
manner, referring the more ample declaration of them to the worke following. And
first of their names and natures: Of Daffodils there are almost an hundred sorts, as they
are seuerally described hereafter, euery one to be distinguished from other, both in their
times, formes, and colours, some being eyther white, or yellow, or mixt, or else being
small or great, single or double, and some hauing but one flower vpon a stalke, others
many, whereof many are so exceeding sweete, that a very few are sufficient to perfume
a whole chamber, and besides, many of them be so faire and double, eyther one vpon
a stalke, or many vpon a stalke, that one or two stalkes of flowers are in stead of a whole
nose-gay, or bundell of flowers tyed together. This I doe affirme vpon good knowledge
and certaine experience, and not as a great many others doe, tell of the wonders of another
world, which themselues neuer saw nor euer heard of, except some superficiall
relation, which themselues haue augmented according to their owne fansie and conceit.
Againe, let me here also by the way tell you, that many idle and ignorant Gardiners
and others, who get names by stealth, as they doe many other things, doe call<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
some of these Daffodils Narcisses, when as all know that know any Latine, that Narcissus
is the Latine name, and Daffodill the English of one and the same thing; and
therefore alone without any other Epithite cannot properly distinguish seuerall things.
I would willingly therefore that all would grow iudicious, and call euery thing by his
proper English name in speaking English, or else by such Latine name as euery thing
hath that hath not a proper English name, that thereby they may distinguish the seuerall
varieties of things and not confound them, as also to take away all excuses of mistaking;
as for example: The single English bastard Daffodill (which groweth wilde in
many Woods, Groues, and Orchards in England.) The double English bastard Daffodill.
The French single white Daffodill many vpon a stalke. The French double yellow
Daffodill. The great, or the little, or the least Spanish yellow bastard Daffodill,
or the great or little Spanish white Daffodill. The Turkie single white Daffodill, or, The
Turkie single or double white Daffodill many vpon a stalke, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Of Fritillaria, or the
checkerd Daffodill, there are halfe a score seuerall sorts, both white and red, both yellow
and blacke, which are a wonderfull grace and ornament to a Garden in regard of
the Checker like spots are in the flowers. Of Iacinthes there are aboue halfe an hundred
sorts, as they are specified hereafter; some like vnto little bells or starres, others like
vnto little bottles or pearles, both white and blew, sky-coloured and blush, and some
starlike of many pretty various formes, and all to giue delight to them that will be curious
to obserue them. Of Crocus or Saffron flowers, there are also twenty sorts;
some of the Spring time, others flowring onely in the Autume or Fall, earlier or later
than another, some whereof abide but a while, others indure aboue a moneth in their
glorious beauty. The Colchicum or Medowe Saffron, which some call the sonne before
the father, but not properly, is of many sorts also; some flowring in the Spring of
the yeare, but the most in Autume, whereof some haue faire double flowers very delightfull
to behold, and some partly coloured both single and double so variable, that it
would make any one admire the worke of the Creatour in the various spots and stripes
of these flowers. Then haue wee of Lillies twenty seuerall sorts and colours, among
whom I must reckon the Crowne Imperiall, that for his stately forme deserueth some
speciall place in this Garden, as also the Martagons, both white and red, both blush and
yellow, that require to be set by themselues apart, as it were in a small round or square
of a knot, without many other, or tall flowers growing neare them. But to tell you of
all the sorts of Tulipas (which are the pride of delight) they are so many, and as I may
say, almost infinite, doth both passe my ability, and as I beleeue the skill of any other.
They are of two especiall sorts, some flowring earlier, and others later than their fellowes,
and that naturally in all grounds, wherein there is such a wonderfull variety
and mixture of colours, that it is almost impossible for the wit of man to descipher them
thoroughly, and to giue names that may be true &amp; seuerall distinctions to euery flower,
threescore seuerall sorts of colours simple and mixed of each kind I can reckon vp that I
haue, and of especiall note, and yet I doubt not, but for euery one of them there are ten others
differing from them, which may be seen at seuerall times, and in seuerall places: &amp;
besides this glory of variety in colors that these flowers haue, they carry so stately &amp; delightfull
a forme, &amp; do abide so long in their brauery (enduring aboue three whole moneths
from the first vnto the last) that there is no Lady or Gentlewoman of any worth
that is not caught with this delight, or not delighted with these flowers. The Anemones
likewise or Windeflowers are so full of variety and so dainty, so pleasant and so
delightsome flowers, that the sight of them doth enforce an earnest longing desire in the
minde of any one to be a possessour of some of them at the least: For without all doubt,
this one kinde of flower, so variable in colours, so differing in forme (being almost as
many sorts of them double as single) so plentifull in bearing flowers, and so durable in
lasting, and also so easie both; to preserue and to encrease, is of it selfe alone almost sufficient
to furnish a garden with their flowers for almost halfe the yeare, as I shall shew
you in a fit and conuenient place. The Beares eares or French Cowslips must not want
their deserued commendations, seeing that their flowers, being many set together
vpon a stalke, doe seeme euery one of them to bee a Nosegay alone of it selfe: and
besides the many differing colours that are to be seene in them, as white, yellow, blush,
purple, red, tawney, murrey, haire colour, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> which encrease much delight in all
sorts of the Gentry of the Land, they are not vnfurnished with a pretty sweete sent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
which doth adde an encrease of pleasure in those that make them an ornament for
their wearing. Flowerdeluces also are of many sorts, but diuided into two especiall,
kindes; the one bearing a leafe like a flagge whose roots are tuberous, thicke and
short (one kinde of them being the Orris rootes that are sold at the Apothecaries,
whereof sweete powders are made to lye among garments) the other having round
rootes like vnto Onions, and narrow long leaues somewhat like grasse: Of both these
kindes there is much variety, especially in their colours. The greater Flagge kinde is
frequent enough and dispersed in this Land, and well doth serue to decke vp both a
Garden and House with natures beauties: But the chiefe of all is your Sable flower,
so fit for a mourning habit, that I thinke in the whole compasse of natures store,
there is not a more patheticall, or of greater correspondency, nor yet among all the
flowers I know any one comming neare vnto the colour of it. The other kinde which
hath bulbous or Onion like rootes, diuersifieth it selfe also into so many fine colours,
being of a more neate shape and succinct forme than the former, that it must not bee
wanting to furnish this Garden. The Hepatica or Noble Liuerwoort is another flower
of account, whereof some are white, others red, or blew, or purple, somewhat resembling
Violets, but that there are white threads in the middest of their flowers,
which adde the more grace vnto them; and one kinde of them is so double, that it resembleth
a double thicke Dasie or Marigold, but being small and of an excellent blew
colour, is like vnto a Button: but that which commendeth the flower as much as the
beauty, is the earlinesse in flowring, for that it is one of the very first flowers that open
themselues after Christmas, euen in the midst of Winter. The Cyclamen or Sowebread
is a flower of rare receipt, because it is naturally hard to encrease, and that the
flowers are like vnto red or blush coloured Violets, flowring in the end of Summer or
beginning of Autumne: the leaues likewise hereof haue no small delight in their pleasant
colour, being knotted and circled white vpon greene, and that which most preferreth
it, is the Physicall properties thereof for women, which I will declare when I
shall shew you the seuerall descriptions of the varieties in his proper place. Many other
sorts of flowers there are fit to furnish this Garden, as Leucoium or Bulbous Violet,
both early and late flowring. Muscari or Muske Grape flower. Starre flowers of diuers
sorts. Phalangium or Spiderwort, the chiefe of many is that sort whose flowers
are like vnto a white Lilly. Winter Crowfoote or Wolfes bane. The Christmas flower
like vnto a single white Rose. Bell flowers of many kindes. Yellow Larkes spurre,
the prettiest flower of a score in a Garden. Flower-gentle or Floramour. Flower of
the Sunne. The Maruaile of Peru or of the world. Double Marsh Marigold or double
yellow Buttons, much differing and farre exceeding your double yellow Crowfoote,
which some call Batchelours Buttons. Double French Marigolds that smell
well, and is a greater kinde than the ordinary, and farre surpasseth it. The double red
Ranunculus or Crowfoote (farre excelling the most glorious double Anemone) and is
like vnto our great yellow double Crowfoote. Thus having giuen you the knowledge
of some of the choisest flowers for the beds of this Garden, let me also shew you
what are fittest for your borders and for your arbours. The Iasmine white and yellow.
The double Honysockle. The Ladies Bower, both white, and red, and purple
single and double, are the fittest of Outlandish plants to set by arbours and banqueting
houses, that are open, both before and aboue to helpe to couer them, and to giue both
sight, smell, and delight. The sorts of Roses are fittest for Standards in the hedges or
borders. The Cherry Bay or Laurocerasus. The Rose Bay or Oleander. The white
and the blew Syringa or Pipe tree, are all gracefull and delightfull to set at seuerall
distances in the borders of knots; for some of them giue beautifull and sweete flowers.
The Pyracantha or Prickly Corall tree doth remaine with greene leaues all the yeare,
and may be plashed, or laid downe, or tyed to make a fine hedge to border the whole
knot, as is said before. The Wilde Bay or Laurus Tinus, doth chiefly desire to be sheltered
vnder a wall, where it will best thriue, and giue you his beautifull flowers in Winter
for your delight, in recompence of his fenced dwelling. The dwarfe Bay or Mesereon,
is most commonly either placed in the midst of a knot, or at the corners thereof,
and sometimes all along a walke for the more grace. And thus to fit euery ones fancy,
I haue shewed you the variety of natures store in some part for you to dispose of them
to your best content.</p>

<i class="sub-title">The nature and names of those that are called vsually English flowers.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ose flowers that haue beene vsually planted in former times in Gardens of
this Kingdome (when as our forefathers knew few or none of those that are recited
before) haue by time and custome attained the name of English flowers,
although the most of them were neuer naturall of this our Land, but brought in from
other Countries at one time or other, by those that tooke pleasure in them where they
first saw them: and I doubt not, but many other sorts than here are set downe, or now
knowne to vs, haue beene brought, which either haue perished by their negligence or
want of skill that brought them, or else because they could not abide our cold Winters;
those onely remaining with vs that haue endured of themselues, and by their encreasing
haue beene distributed ouer the whole Land. If I should make any large discourse
of them, being so well knowne to all, I doubt I should make a long tale to small
purpose: I will therefore but briefly recite them, that you may haue them together in
one place, with some little declaration of the nature and quality of them, and so passe
to other matters. And first of Primroses and Cowslips, whereof there are many prettie
varieties; some better knowne in the West parts of this Kingdome, others in the
North, than in any other, vntill of late being obserued by some curious louers of varieties,
they haue been transplanted diuersly, and so made more common: for although
we haue had formerly in these parts about London greene Primroses vsually, yet we
neuer saw or heard of greene Cowslips both single and double but of late dayes, and
so likewise for Primroses to be both single and double from one roote, and diuers vpon
one stalke of diuers fashions, I am sure is not vsuall: all which desire rather to bee
planted vnder some hedge, or fence, or in the shade, than in the Sunne. Single Rose
Campions, both white, red, and blush, and the double red Rose Campion also is
knowne sufficiently, and will abide moderate Sunne as well as the shade. The flower
of Bristow or None-such is likewise another kinde of Campion, whereof there is both
white flowring plants and blush as well as Orange colour, all of them being single
flowers require a moderate Sunne and not the shadow: But the Orange colour Nonesuch
with double flowers, as it is rare and not common, so for his brauery doth well
deserue a Master of account that will take care to keepe and preserue it. Batchelours
Buttons both white and red, are kindes of wilde Campions of a very double forme,
and will reasonably well like the Sunne but not the shade. Wall-flowers are common
in euery Garden, as well the ordinary double as the single, and the double kinde desireth
no more shade than the single, but the greater kindes both double and single must
haue the Sunne. Stock-Gilloflowers likewise are almost as common as Wall-flowers,
especially the single kindes in euery womans Garden, but the double kindes are much
more rare, and possessed but of a few, and those onely that will bee carefull to preserue
them in Winter; for besides that the most of them are more tender, they yeeld
no seede as the single kindes doe to preserue them, although one kinde from the sowing
of the seed yeeld double flowers: They will all require the comfort of the Sunne,
especially the double kindes, and to be defended from cold, yet so as in the Summer
they doe not want water wherein they much ioy, and which is as it were their life.
Queenes Gilloflowers (which some call Dames Violets, and some Winter Gilloflowers,
are a kinde of Stock-Gilloflower) planted in Gardens to serue to fill vp the parts
thereof for want of better things, hauing in mine opinion neither sight nor sent much
to commend them. Violets are the Springs chiefe flowers for beauty, smell, and vse,
both single and double, the more shadie and moist they stand the better. Snapdragon
are flowers of much more delight, and in that they are more tender to keep, and will
hardly endure the sharpe Winters, vnlesse they stand well defended, are scarce seene
in many Gardens. Columbines single and double, of many sorts, fashions, and colours,
very variable both speckled and party coloured, are flowers of that respect, as
that no Garden would willingly bee without them, that could tell how to haue them,
yet the rarer the flowers are, the more trouble to keepe; the ordinary sorts on the con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>trary
part will not be lost, doe what one will. Larkes heeles, or spurres, or toes, as in
seuerall Countries they are called, exceed in the varietie of colours, both single and
double, any of the former times; for vntill of late dayes none of the most pleasant colours
were seene or heard of: but now the single kindes are reasonable well disperst
ouer the Land, yet the double kindes of all those pleasant colours (and some other also
as beautifull) which stand like little double Roses, are enioyed but of a few: all of
them rise from seed, and must be sowne euery yeare, the double as well as the single.
Pansyes or Hartes eases of diuers colours, and although without sent, yet not without
some respect and delight. Double Poppies are flowers of a great and goodly proportion,
adorning a Garden with their variable colours to the delight of the beholders,
wherein there is some speciall care to be taken, lest they turne single; and that is, if you
see them grow vp too thicke, that you must pull them vp, and not suffer them to grow
within lesse than halfe a yard distance, or more one from another. Double Daisies are
flowers not to be forgotten, although they be common enough in euery Garden, being
both white and red, both blush and speckled, or party coloured, besides that
which is called Iacke an Apes on horsebacke, they require a moist and shadowie place;
for they are scorched away, if they stand in the Sunne in any dry place. Double Marigolds
also are the most common in all Gardens. And so are the French Marigolds
that haue a strong heady sent, both single and double, whose glorious shew for colour
would cause any to beleeue there were some rare goodnesse or vertue in them. These
all are sometimes preserued in the Winter, if they bee well defended from the cold.
But what shall I say to the Queene of delight and of flowers, Carnations and Gilloflowers,
whose brauery, variety, and sweete smell ioyned together, tyeth euery ones
affection with great earnestnesse, both to like and to haue them? Those that were
knowne, and enioyed in former times with much acceptation, are now for the most
part lesse accounted of, except a very few: for now there are so many other varieties
of later inuention, that trebleth the other both in number, beauty, and worth: The
names of them doe differ very variably, in that names are imposed and altered as euerie
ones fancy will haue them, that carryed or sent them into the seuerall Countries
from London, where their truest name is to be had, in mine opinion. I will here but
giue you the names of some, and referre you to the worke ensuing for your further
knowledge. The red and the gray Hulo. The old Carnation, differing from them
both. The Gran Pere. The Cambersiue. The Sauadge. The Christall. The Prince.
The white Carnation, or Delicate. The ground Carnation. The French Carnation.
The Douer. The Oxford. The Bristow. The Westminster. The Daintie. The Granado,
and many other Gilloflowers too tedious to recite in this place, because I haue
amply declared them in the <a href="#Chap_2_LXIX" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 59">booke following</a>. But there is another sort of great delight
and varietie, called the Orange tawny Gilloflower, which for the most part hath
risen from seed, and doth giue seed in a more plentifull manner than any of the former
sorts, and likewise by the sowing of the seed, there hath been gained so many varieties
of that excellent worth and respect, that it can hardly be expressed or beleeued,
and called by diuers names according to the marking of the flowers; as The Infanta.
The Stript Tawny, The Speckled Tawny. The Flackt Tawny. The Griseld Tawny,
and many others, euery one to bee distinguished from others: Some also haue their
flowers more double and large than others, and some from the same seed haue single
flowers like broad single Pinkes: the further relation of them, viz. their order to sowe,
encrease and preserue them, you shall haue in the subsequent discourse in a place by it
selfe. Pinkes likewise both single and double are of much variety, all of them very
sweete, comming neare the Gilloflowers. Sweete Williams and Sweete Iohns, both
single and double, both white, red, and spotted, as they are kindes of wilde Pinkes, so
for their grace and beauty helpe to furnish a Garden, yet desire not to stand so open to
the Sunne as the former. Double and single Peonies are fit flowers to furnish a Garden,
and by reason of their durability, giue out fresh pleasure euery yeare without any further
trouble of sowing. And lastly, Hollihocks both single and double, of many and
sundry colours, yeeld out their flowers like Roses on their tall branches, like Trees, to
sute you with flowers, when almost you haue no other to grace out your Garden: the
single and double doe both yeeld seed, and yet doe after their seeding abide many
yeares. Thus haue I shewed you most of the English, as well as (I did before) the Out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>landish
flowers that are fit to furnish the knots, trailes, beds, and borders of this Garden.
Roses onely, as I said before, I reserve to circle or encompasse all the rest, because
that for the most part they are planted in the outer borders or the quarters, and sometimes
by themselues in the middle of long beds, the sorts or kindes whereof are many,
as they are declared in their proper place: but the White Rose, the Red, and
the Damaske, are the most ancient Standards in England, and therefore accounted
naturall.</p>

<i class="sub-title">The order and manner to plant and replant all the sorts of Out-landish flowers spoken of
before, as well those with bulbous rootes, as others with
stringie rootes.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">W<span class="looks_big">h</span>ereas it is the vsuall custome of most in this Land, to turne vp their Gardens,
and to plant them againe in the Spring of the yeare, which is the
best time that may bee chosen for all English flowers, yet it is not so for
your Out-landish flowers. And herein indeede hath beene not onely the errour of a
great many to hinder their rootes from bearing out their flowers as they should, but
also to hinder many to take delight in them, because as they say they will not thriue
and prosper with them, when as the whole fault is in the want of knowledge of the fit
and conuenient time wherein they should bee planted. And because our English Gardiners
are all or the most of them vtterly ignorant in the ordering of these Out-landish
flowers, as not being trained vp to know them, I haue here taken vpon mee the forme
of a new Gardiner, to giue instructions to those that will take pleasure in them, that
they may be the better enabled with these helpes I shall shew them, both to know how
they should be ordered, and to direct their Gardiners that are ignorant thereof, rightly
to dispose them according to their naturall qualities. And I doe wish all Gentlemen
and Gentlewomen, whom it may concerne for their owne good, to bee as carefull
whom they trust with the planting and replanting of these fine flowers, as they would
be with so many Iewels; for the rootes of many of them being small, and of great value,
may be soone conueyed away, and a cleanly tale faire told, that such a roote is
rotten, or perished in the ground if none be seen where it should be, or else that the
flower hath changed his colour, when it hath been taken away, or a counterfeit one
hath beene put in the place thereof; and thus many haue been deceiued of their daintiest
flowers, without remedy or true knowledge of the defect. You shall therefore, if
you will take the right course that is proper for these kindes of flowers, not set or plant
them among your English flowers; for that when the one may be remoued, the other
may not be stirred: but plant those rootes that are bulbous, or round like Onions, eyther
in knots or beds by themselues which is the best, or with but very few English or
Out-landish flower plants that haue stringie rootes: For you must take this for a generall
rule, that all those rootes that are like Lillies or Onions, are to bee planted in the
moneths of Iuly or August, or vnto the middle or end of September at the furthest, if
you will haue them to prosper as they should; and not in the Spring of the yeare, when
other gardening is vsed. Yet I must likewise giue you to vnderstand, that if Tulipas,
and Daffodils, and some other that are firme and hard rootes, and not limber or
spongie, being taken vp out of the ground in their fit season, that is, in Iune, Iuly, and
August, and likewise kept well and dry, may be reserued out of the ground vntill
Christmas or after, and then (if they could not be set sooner) being set, will thriue reasonable
well, but not altogether so well as the former, being set long before; but if
you shall remoue these bulbous rootes againe, either presently after their planting; hauing
shot their small fibres vnder the round rootes, and sprung likewise vpwards, or
before they be in flower at the soonest (yet Tulipas, Daffodils, and many other bulbous,
may be safely remoued being in flower, and transplanted into other places, so as
they be not kept too long out of the ground) you shall much endanger them either vtterly
to perish, or to be hindered from bearing out their flowers they then would haue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
borne, and for two or three years after from bearing flowers againe. For the order of
their planting there are diuers wayes, some whereof I will shew you in this place: Your
knot or beds being prepared fitly, as before is declared, you may place and order your
rootes therein thus, Eyther many rootes of one kind set together in a round or cluster,
or longwise crosse a bed one by another, whereby the beauty of many flowers of one
kinde being together, may make a faire shew well pleasing to many; Or else you may
plant one or two in a place dispersedly ouer the whole knot, or in a proportion or diameter
one place answering another of the knot, as your store will suffer you, or your
knot permit: Or you may also mingle these rootes in their planting many of diuers
sorts together, that they may giue the more glorious shew when they are in flower; and
that you may so doe, you must first obserue the seuerall kindes of them, which doe
flower at one and the same time, and then to place them in such order and so neare one
vnto another, that their flowers appearing together of seuerall colours, will cause the
more admiration in the beholders: as thus, The Vernall Crocus or Saffron flowers of
the Spring, white, purple, yellow, and stript, with some Vernall Colchicum or Medow
Saffron among them, some Dens Caninus or Dogges teeth, and some of the small early
Leucoium or Bulbous Violet, all planted in some proportion as neare one vnto another
as is fit for them, will giue such a grace to the Garden, that the place will seeme
like a peece of tapestry of many glorious colours, to encrease euery ones delight: Or
else many of one sort together, as the blew, white, and blush Grape flowers in the same
manner intermingled, doe make a maruellous delectable shew, especially because all of
them rise almost to an equall height, which causeth the greater grace, as well neare
hand as farre of. The like order may be kept with many other things, as the Hepatica,
white, blew, purple, and red set or sowne together, will make many to beleeue that
one roote doth beare all those colours: But aboue and beyond all others, the Tulipas
may be so matched, one colour answering and setting of another, that the place where
they stand may resemble a peece of curious needle-worke, or peece of painting; and I
haue knowne in a Garden, the Master as much commended for this artificiall forme in
placing the colours of Tulipas, as for the goodnesse of his flowers, or any other thing.
The diuers sorts and colours of Anemones or Winde-flowers may be so ordered likewise,
which are very beautifull, to haue the seuerall varieties planted one neare vnto
another, that their seuerall colours appearing in one place will be a very great grace in
a Garden, or if they be dispersed among the other sorts of flowers, they will make a
glorious shew. Another order in planting you may obserue; which is this, That those
plants that grow low, as the Aconitum Hyemale or Winter-wolues bane, the Vernall
Crocus or Saffron-flowers of diuers sorts, the little early Leucoium or Bulbous Violet,
and some such other as rise not vp high, as also some Anemones may be very well
placed somewhat neare or about your Martagons, Lillies, or Crownes Imperiall, both
because these little plants will flower earlier than they, and so will bee gone and past,
before the other greater plants will rise vp to any height to hinder them; which is a
way may well be admitted in those Gardens that are small, to saue roome, and to place
things to the most aduantage. Thus hauing shewed you diuers wayes and orders how
to plant your rootes, that your flowers may giue the greater grace in the Garden, let
mee shew you likewise how to set these kindes of rootes into the ground; for many
know not well eyther which end to set vpwards or downewards, nor yet to what
depth they should be placed in the ground. Daffodils if they be great rootes, will require
(as must bee obserued in all other great plants) to bee planted somewhat deeper
than the smaller of the same kinde as also that the tops or heads of the rootes be about
two or three fingers breadth hid vnder ground. The Tulipas likewise if you set them
deepe, they will be the safer from frosts if your ground be cold, which will also cause
them to be a little later before they be in flower, yet vsually if the mould be good, they
are to be set a good hand breadth deep within the ground, so that there may be three or
foure inches of earth at the least aboue the head, which is the smaller end of the roote:
for if they shall lye too neare the vpper face or crust of the earth, the colds &amp; frosts will
pierce and pinch them the sooner. After the same order and manner must Hyacinthes,
whether great or small, and other such great rootes be planted. Your greater rootes, as
Martagons, Lillies, and Crownes Imperiall, must be set much deeper than any other
bulbous roote, because they are greater rootes than others, and by themselues also, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
is most vsuall either in some square, round, triangle, or other small part in the Garden,
because they spread and take vp a very great deale of ground. All of them likewise
are to be set with the broad end of the roote downewards, and the small end vpwards,
that is, both Lillies, Daffodils, Hyacinthes, and Tulipas, and all other sorts of round
rootes, which shew one end to bee smaller than another. But the Colchicum or Medow-Saffron
onely requireth an exception to this generall rule, in regard the roote
thereof hath a small eminence or part on the one side thereof, which must bee set or
planted downeward, and not vpward; for you shall obserue, if the roote lye a little
moist out of the ground, that it will shoote fibres out at the small long end thereof, although
you may perceiue when you take it vp, that the fibres were at the other broad
end or side of the roote. As for the Crowne Imperiall, which is a broad round roote
and flat withall, hauing a hole in the middle, for the most part quite thorow, when it
is taken vp in his due time out of the ground, you shall perceiue the scales or cloues of
the rootes to bee a little open on the vpperside, and close and flat on the vnderside,
which will direct you which part to set vpward; as also that the hole is bigger aboue
then it is below. The Persian Lilly is almost like unto the Crowne Imperiall, but that
the roote thereof is not so flat, and that it hath a smaller head at the one part, whereby
it may be discerned the plainer how to be set. The Fritillaria is a small white root diuided
as it were into two parts, so that many haue doubted, as formerly in the Crowne
Imperiall, what part to set vppermost; you shall therefore marke, that the two parts
of the roote are ioyned together at the bottome, where it shooteth out fibres or small
stringie rootes, as all other sorts of bulbous rootes doe, and withall you shall see, that
betweene the two parts of the roote a small head will appeare, which is the burgeon
that will spring vp to beare leaues and flowers. In the rootes of Anemones there are
small round swelling heads, easie enough to be obserued if you marke it, which must be
set vpwards. All other sorts of stringie rooted plants (and not bulbous or tuberous
rooted) that lose their greene leaues in Winter, will shew a head from whence the
leaues and flowers will spring, and all others that keepe their greene leaues, are to bee
planted in the same manner that other herbes and flower-plants are accustomed to be.
But yet for the better thriuing of the stringie rooted plants, when you will plant
them, let me informe you of the best way of planting, and the most sure to cause any
plant to comprehend in the ground without failing, and is no common way with any
Gardiner in this Kingdome, that euer I heard or knew, which is thus: Presuming that
the stringie rooted plant is fresh and not old gathered, and a plant that being remoued
will grow againe, make a hole in the ground large enough where you meane to set this
roote, and raise the earth within the hole a little higher in the middle then on the sides,
and set the roote thereon, spreading the strings all abroad about the middle, that they
may as it were couer the middle, and then put the earth gently round about it, pressing
it a little close, and afterwards water it well, if it be in Summer, or in a dry time, or otherwise
moderately: thus shall euery seuerall string of the roote haue earth enough to
cause it to shoote forth, and thereby to encrease farre better than by the vsuall way,
which is without any great care and respect to thrust the rootes together into the
ground. Diuers other flower plants are but annuall, to bee new sowne euery yeare; as
the Maruaile of the world, the Indian Cresses, or yellow Larkes heeles, the Flower of
the Sunne, and diuers others: they therefore that will take pleasure in them, that they
may enioy their flowers the earlier in the yeare, and thereby haue ripe seede of them
while warme weather lasteth, must nurse vp their seedes in a bed of hot dung, as Melons
and Cowcumbers are, but your bed must be prouided earlier for these seeds, than
for Melons, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> that they may haue the more comfort of the Summer, which are to be
carefully tended after they are transplanted from the hotbed, and couered with straw
from colds, whereby you shall not faile to gaine ripe seed euery yeare, which otherwise
if you should misse of a very kindly &amp; hot Summer, you should neuer haue. Some
of these seedes neede likewise to be transplanted from the bed of dung vnder a warme
wall, as the Flower of the Sunne, and the Maruaile of the world, and some others, and
that for a while after their transplanting, as also in the heate of Summer, you water
them at the roote with water that hath stood a day or two in the Sunne, hauing first laid
a round wispe of hay or such other thing round about the roote, that so all helpes may
further their giuing of ripe seede. One or two rules more I will giue you concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
these dainty flowers, the first whereof is this, That you shall not bee carefull to water
any of your bulbous or tuberous rooted plants at any time; for they all of them do better
prosper in a dry ground than in a wet, onely all sorts of tuberous rooted Flowerdeluces
vpon their remouall had neede of a little water, and some will doe so also to such
Tulipas and other bulbous rootes as they transplant, when they are in flower, and this
is I grant in some sort tolerable, if it bee not too much, and done onely to cause the
stalke and flower to abide sometime the longer before they wither, but else in no other
case to be permitted. The second rule is, That I would aduise you to water none of
your dainty flowers or herbes, with any water that hath presently before been drawne
out of a well or pumpe, but onely with such water that hath stood open in the Sunne
in some cisterne, tubbe, or pot for a day at the least, if more the better: for that water
which is presently drawne out of a well, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> is so cold, that it presently chilleth &amp; killeth
any dainty plant be it younger or elder grown, whereof I haue had sufficient proofe:
and therfore I giue you this caution by mine own experience. Thus haue I directed you
from point to point, in all the particulars of preparing &amp; planting that belong to this
Garden, sauing only that yet I would further enforme you of the time of the flowring
of these Out-landish plants, according to the seuerall moneths in the yeare, that euery
one may know what flowers euery moneth yeeldeth, and may chuse what them liketh
best, in that they may see that there is no moneth, but glorieth in some peculiar sorts of
rare flowers. I would likewise rather in this place shew you, the true and best manner
&amp; order to encrease and preserue all sorts of Gilloflowers &amp; Carnations, then ioyne it
with the Chapter of Gilloflowers in the <a href="#Chap_2_LXIX" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 59">worke following</a>, because it would in that
place take vp too much roome. And lastly, I must of necessity oppose three sundry
errours, that haue possessed the mindes of many both in former and later times, which
are, that any flower may be made to grow double by art, that was but single before by
nature: And that one may by art cause any flower to grow of what colour they will:
And that any plants may be forced to flower out of their due seasons, either earlier or
later, by an art which some can vse. All which being declared, I then suppose enough
is spoken for an introduction to this worke, referring many other things to the seuerall
directions in the Chapters of the booke.</p>

<i class="sub-title">The seuerall times of the flowring of these Out-landish flowers, according to the seuerall
moneths of the yeare.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">I <span class="looks_big">i</span>ntend in this place onely to giue you briefly, the names of some of the chiefest of
these Out-landish flowers, according to the seuerall moneths of the yeare wherein
they flower, that euery one seeing what sorts of flowers euery moneth yeeldeth,
may take of them which they like best. I begin with Ianuary, as the first moneth of the
yeare, wherein if the frosts be not extreme, you shall haue these flowers of plants; the
Christmas flower or Helleborus niger verus, Winter wolues bane or Aconitum hyemale,
Hepatica or Noble Liuer wort blew and red, and of shrubbes, the Laurus Tinus
or Wilde Bay tree, and Mesereon or the dwarfe Bay: but because Ianuarie is oftentimes
too deepe in frosts and snow, I therefore referre the Hepaticas vnto the moneth
following, which is February, wherein the weather beginneth to be a little milder,
and then they will flower much better, as also diuers sorts of Crocus or Saffron flower
will appeare, the little early Summer foole or Leucoium bulbosum, and towards
the latter end thereof the Vernall Colchicum, the Dogges tooth Violet or Dens Caninus,
and some Anemones, both single and double, which in some places will flower
all the Winter long. March will yeeld more varieties; for besides that it holdeth
some of the flowers of the former moneth, it will yeeld you both the double blew Hepatica,
and the white and the blush single: then also you shall haue diuers other sorts
of Crocus or Saffron flowers, Double yellow Daffodils, Orientall Iacinths and others,
the Crowne Imperiall, diuers sorts of early Tulipas, some sorts of French Cowslips,
both tawney, murry, yellow and blush, the early Fritillaria or checkered Daffo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>dill,
and some other sorts of early Daffodils, and many sorts of Anemones. In Aprill
commeth on the pride of these strangers; for herein you may behold all the sorts of
Auricula Vrsi or Beares Eares, many sorts of Anemones, both single and double,
both the sorts of Tulipas, the earlier vntill the middle of the moneth, and the later
then beginning; which are of so many different colours, that it is almost impossible to
expresse them, the white, red, blacke, and yellow Fritillarias, the Muscari or Muske
Grape flower, both ash colour and yellow. Diuers other sorts of Iacinths and Daffodils,
both single and double, the smaller sorts of Flowerdeluces, the Veluet Flowerdeluce
and double Honysuckles, with diuers others. May likewise at the beginning
seemeth as glorious as Aprill, although toward the end it doth decline, in regard the
heate of the Sunne hath by this time drawne forth all the store of natures tenderest
dainties, which are vsually spent by the end of this moneth, and then those of stronger
constitution come forward. Herein are to bee seene at the beginning the middle flowring
Tulipas, and at the end the later sorts: some kindes of Daffodils, the Day Lillies,
the great white Starre flower, the Flowerdeluce of Constantinople or the mourning
Sable flower, the other sorts of Flowerdeluces. Single and double white Crowfoote,
and single and double red Crowfoot, the glory of a Garden: the early red Martagon,
the Persian Lilly, the yellow Martagon, the Gladiolus or Corne flagge, both white,
red, and blush: the double yellow Rose, and some other sorts of Roses. In Iune doe
flower the white and the blush Martagon, the Martagon Imperiall, the mountaine Lillies,
and the other sorts of white and red Lillies, the bulbous Flowerdeluces of diuers
sorts, the red flowred Ladies bower, the single and double purple flowred Ladies bower,
the white Syringa or Pipe tree, for the blew Pipe tree flowreth earlier, the white
and the yellow Iasmin. Iuly holdeth in flower some of the Ladies bowers and Iasmines,
and besides doth glory in the Female Balsame apple, the Indian Cresses or yellow
Larkes spurres, the purple Flower-gentle and the Rose Bay. In August begin
some of the Autumne bulbous flowers to appeare, as the white and the purple Colchicum
or Medow Saffron, the purple mountaine Crocus or Saffron flower, the little
Autumne Leucoium and Autumne Iacinth, the Italian Starrewort, called of some the
purple Marigold, the Meruaile of Peru or of the world, the Flower of the Sunne, the
great blew Bell-flower, the great double French Marigold. September flourisheth
with the Flower of the Sunne, the Meruaile of the world, the purple Marigold, and
blew Bell-flower spoken of before, and likewise the other sorts of Medow Saffron, and
the double kinde likewise, the siluer Crocus, the Autumne yellow Daffodill, Cyclamen
also or Sowbread shew their flowers in the end of this moneth. October also
will shew the flowers of Cyclamen, and some of the Medow Saffrons. In Nouember,
as also sometimes in the moneth before, the party coloured Medow Saffron may bee
seene, that will longest hold his flower, because it is the latest that sheweth it selfe, and
the ash coloured mountaine Crocus. And euen December it selfe will not want the
true blacke Hellebor or Christmas flower, and the glorious shew of the Laurus Tinus
or wilde Bay tree. Thus haue I shewed you some of the flowers for euery moneth,
but I referre you to the more ample declarion of them and all the others, vnto the work
following.</p>

<i class="sub-title">The true manner and order to encrease and preserue all sorts of Gilloflowers, as well
by slippes as seedes.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">B<span class="looks_big">e</span>cause that Carnations and Gilloflowers bee the chiefest flowers of account in
all our English Gardens, I haue thought good to entreate somewhat amply of
them, and that a part by it selfe, as I said a little before, in regard there is so
much to be said concerning them, and that if all the matters to be entreated of should
haue beene inserted in <a href="#Chap_2_LXIX" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 59">the Chapter of Gilloflowers</a>, it would haue made it too tedious
and large, and taken vp too much roome. The particular matters whereof I mean
in this place to entreate are these: How to encrease Gilloflowers by planting and by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
sowing, and how to preserue them being encreased, both in Summer from noysome
and hurtfull vermine that destroy them, and in Winter from frosts, snowes, and
windes, that spoile them. There are two wayes of planting, whereby to encrease
these faire flowers; the one is by slipping which is the old and ready vsuall way, best
knowne in this Kingdome; the other is more sure, perfect, ready, and of later inuention,
<i>videlicet</i>, by laying downe the branches. The way to encrease Gilloflowers by
slipping, is so common with all that euer kept any of them, that I think most persons
may thinke me idle, to spend time to set downe in writing that which is so well known
vnto all: Yet giue me leaue to tell them that so might imagine, that (when they haue
heard or read what I haue written thereof, if they did know fully as much before) what
I here write, was not to informe them, but such as did not know the best, or so good a
way as I teach them: For I am assured, the greatest number doe vse, and follow the
most vsuall way, and that is not alwaies the best, especially when by good experience
a better way is found, and may be learned; and therefore if some can doe a thing
better than others, I thinke it is no shame to learne it of them. You shall not then (to
take the surest course) take any long spindled branches, nor those branches that haue
any young shootes from the ioynts on them, nor yet sliue or teare any slippe or branch
from the roote; for all these waies are vsuall and common with most, which causeth
so many good rootes to rot and perish, and also so many slippes to be lost, when as
for the most part, not the one halfe, or with some, not a third part doth grow and
thriue of those slippes they set. And although many that haue store of plants, doe not
so much care what hauocke they make to gaine some, yet to saue both labour and
plants, I doe wish them to obserue these orders: Take from those rootes from whence
you intend to make your encrease, those shootes onely that are reasonable strong, but
yet young, and not either too small and slender, or hauing any shootes from the ioynts
vpon them; cut these slippes or shootes off from the stemme or roote with a knife, as
conueniently as the shoote or branch will permit, that is, either close vnto the maine
branch, if it be short, or leauing a ioynt or two behinde you, if it be long enough, at
which it may shoote anew: When you haue cut off your slippes, you may either set
them by and by, or else as the best Gardiners vse to doe, cast them into a tubbe or pot
with water for a day or two, and then hauing prepared a place conuenient to set them
in, which had neede to bee of the finest, richest, and best mould you can prouide,
that they may thriue therein the better, cut off your slippe close at the ioynt, and hauing
cut away the lowest leaues close to the stalke, and the vppermost euen at the top,
with a little sticke make a little hole in the earth, and put your slippe therein so deep, as
that the vpper leaues may be wholly aboue the ground, (some vse to cleaue the stalke
in the middle, and put a little earth or clay within the cleft, but many good and skilfull
Gardiners doe not vse it); put the earth a little close to the slippe with your finger
and thumbe, and there let it rest, and in this manner doe with as many slippes as you
haue, setting them somewhat close together, and not too farre in sunder, both to saue
ground and cost thereon, in that a small compasse will serue for the first planting, and
also the better to giue them shadow: For you must remember in any case, that these
slippes new set, haue no sight of the Sunne, vntill they be well taken in the ground, and
shot aboue ground, and also that they want not water, both vpon the new planting
and after. When these slippes are well grown vp, they must be transplanted into such
other places as you thinke meete; that is, either into the ground in beds, or otherwise,
or into pots, which that you may the more safely doe, after you haue well watered
the ground, for halfe a day before you intend to transplant them, you shall separate
them seuerally, by putting down a broad pointed knife on each side of the slippe,
so cutting it out, take euery one by it selfe, with the earth cleauing close vnto the root,
which by reason of the moisture it had formerly, and that which you gaue presently
before, will be sufficient with any care had, to cause it to hold fast vnto the roote for
the transplanting of it: for if the earth were dry, and that it should fall away from the
roote in the transplanting, it would hazzard and endanger the roote very much, if it
did thriue at all. You must remember also, that vpon the remouing of these slips, you
shadow them from the heate of the Sunne for a while with some straw or other thing,
vntill they haue taken hold in their new place. Thus although it bee a little more labour
and care than the ordinary way is, yet it is surer, and will giue you plants that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
will be so strongly growne before Winter, that with the care hereafter specified, you
shall haue them beare flowers the next yeare after, and yeeld you encrease of slippes
also. To giue you any set time, wherein these slippes will take roote, and begin to
shoote aboue ground, is very hard to doe; for that euery slip, or yet euery kinde of Gilloflower
is not alike apt to grow; nor is euery earth in like manner fit to produce and
bring forward the slippes that are set therein: but if both the slippe be apt to grow, and
the earth of the best, fit to produce, I thinke within a fortnight or three weekes, you
shall see them begin to put forth young leaues in the middle, or else it may be a moneth
and more before you shall see any springing. The best time likewise when to plant, is
a speciall thing to be knowne, and of as great consequence as any thing else: For if you
slippe and set in September, as many vse to doe, or yet in August, as some may thinke
will doe well, yet (vnlesse they be the most ordinary sorts, which are likely to grow at
any time, and in any place) the most of them, if not all, will either assuredly perish or
neuer prosper well: for the more excellent and dainty the Gilloflower is, the more
tender for the most part, and hard to nurse vp will the slippes be. The best time therefore
is, that you cut off such slippes as are likely, and such as your rootes may spare,
from the beginning of May vntill the middle of Iune at the furthest, and order them
as I haue shewed you before, that so you may haue faire plants, plenty of flowers, and
encrease sufficient for new supply, without offence or losse of your store. For the enriching
likewise of your earth, wherein you shall plant your slippes, that they may the
better thriue and prosper, diuers haue vsed diuers sorts of manure; as stable soyle of
horse, beasts or kine, of sheepe, and pigeons, all which are very good when they are
thoroughly turned to mould, to mixe with your other earth, or being steeped in water,
may serue to water the earth at times, and turned in with it. And some haue likewise
proued Tanners earth, that is, their barke, which after they haue vsed, doth lye on
heapes and rot in their yards, or the like mould from wood-stackes or yards; but especially,
and beyond all other is commended the Willow earth, that is, that mould
which is found in the hollow of old Willow trees, to be the most principall to mixe
with other good earth for this purpose. And as I haue now giuen you directions for
the first way to encrease them by slipping, so before I come to the other way, let mee
giue you a caueat or two for the preseruing of them, when they are beginning to runne
vtterly to decay and perish: The one is, that whereas many are, ouer greedy to haue
their plants to giue them flowers, and therefore let them runne all to flower, so farre
spending themselues thereby, that after they haue done flowring, they grow so weake,
hauing out spent themselues, that they cannot possibly be preserued from the iniuries
of the succeeding Winter; you shall therefore keepe the kinde of any sort you are delighted
withall, if you carefully looke that too many branches doe not runne vp and
spindle for flowers, but rather either cut some of them downe, before they are run vp
too high, within two or three ioynts of the rootes; or else pluck away the innermost
leaues where it springeth forwards, which you see in the middle of euery branch, before
it be runne vp too high, which will cause them to breake out the faster into slips
and suckers at the ioynts, to hinder their forward luxurie, and to preserue them
the longer: The other is, If you shall perceiue any of your Gilloflower leaues to
change their naturall fresh verdure, and turne yellowish, or begin to wither in anie
part or branch thereof, it is a sure signe that the roote is infected with some cancker
or rottennesse, and will soon shew it selfe in all the rest of the branches, whereby the
plant will quickly be lost: to preserue it therefore, you shall betime, before it be runne
too farre, (for otherwise it is impossible to saue it) either couer all or most of the
branches with fresh earth, or else take the fairest slippes from it, as many as you can
possibly, and cast them into a pot or tubbe with water, and let them there abide for
two or three daies at the least: the first way hath recouered many, being taken in time.
Thus you shall see them recouer their former stiffenesse and colour, and then you may
plant them as you haue beene heretofore directed; and although many of them may
perish, yet shall you haue some of them that will grow to continue the kinde againe.
The other or second way to encrease Gilloflowers by planting, is, as I said before, by
in-laying or laying downe the branches of them and is a way of later inuention, and
as frequently vsed, not onely for the tawney or yellow Gilloflower, and all the varieties
therof, but with the other kinds of Gilloflowers, whereof experience hath shewed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that they will likewise take if they be so vsed; the manner whereof is thus: You must
choose out the youngest, likeliest, and lowest branches that are nearest the ground (for
the vpper branches will sooner breake at the ioynt, than bend downe so low into the
earth, without some pot with earth raised vp vnto them) and cut it on the vnderside
thereof vpwards at the second ioynt next vnto the roote, to the middle of the branch,
and no more, and not quite thorough in any case, and then from that second ioynt vnto
the third; slit or cut the branch in the middle longwise, that so it may be the more
easily bended into the ground, the cut ioynt seeming like the end of a slippe, when
you haue bended downe the branch where it is cut into the ground (which must bee
done very gently for feare of breaking) with a little sticke or two thrust slopwise,
crosse ouer it, keepe it downe within the earth, and raise vp sufficient earth ouer it, that
there it may lye and take roote, which commonly will be effected within sixe weekes
or two moneths in the Summer time, and then (or longer if you doubt the time too
short for it to take sufficient roote) you may take or cut it away, and transplant it where
you thinke good, yet so as in any case you shadow it from the heate of the Sunne, vntill
it haue taken good hold in the ground. The other way to encrease Gilloflowers,
is by sowing the seede: It is not vsuall with all sorts of Gilloflowers to giue seede, but
such of them as doe yeeld seede may be encreased thereby, in the same manner as is
here set downe. The Orange tawney Gilloflower and the varieties thereof is the most
vsuall kinde, (and it is a kinde by it selfe, how various soeuer the plants be that rise
from the seede) that doth giue seede, and is sowne, and from thence ariseth so many
varieties of colours, both plaine and mixt, both single and double, that one can hardly
set them downe in writing: yet such as I haue obserued and marked, you shall finde
expressed in the Chapter of Gilloflowers in the <a href="#Chap_2_LXIX" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 59">worke following</a>. First therefore
make choise of your seede that you intend to sowe (if you doe not desire to haue as
many more single flowers as double) that it bee taken from double flowers, and not
from single, and from the best colours, howsoeuer some may boast to haue had double
and stript flowers from the seede of a single one; which if it were so, yet one Swallow
(as we say) maketh no Summer, nor a thing comming by chance cannot bee reckoned
for a certaine and constant rule; you may be assured they will not vsually doe so: but
the best, fairest, and most double flowers come alwaies, or for the most part, from the
seede of those flowers that were best, fairest, and most double; and I doe aduise you
to take the best and most double: for euen from them you shall haue single ones enow,
you neede not sowe any worser sort. And againe, see that your seede bee
new, of the last yeares gathering, and also that it was full ripe before it was gathered,
lest you lose your labour, or misse of your purpose, which is, to haue faire and double
flowers. Hauing now made choise of your seede, and prepared you a bedde to sowe
them on, the earth whereof must be rich and good, and likewise sifted to make it the
finer; for the better it is, the better shall your profit and pleasure bee: hereon, being
first made leuell, plaine, and smooth, sowe your seede somewhat thinne, and not too
thicke in any case, and as euenly as you can, that they be not too many in one place,
and too few in another, which afterwards couer with fine sifted earth ouer them about
one fingers thicknesse; let this be done in the middle of Aprill, if the time of the yeare
be temperate, and not too cold, or else stay vntill the end of the moneth: after they
are sprung vp and growne to be somewhat bigge, let them bee drawne forth that are
too close and neare one vnto another, and plant them in such place where they shall
continue, so that they stand halfe a yard of ground distance asunder, which after the
planting, let be shadowed for a time, as is before specified; and this may bee done in
the end of Iuly, or sooner if there be cause. I haue not set downe in all this discourse
of planting, transplanting, sowing, setting, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> any mention of watering those slips
or plants, not doubting but that euery ones reason will induce them to thinke, that
they cannot prosper without watering: But let this Caueat be a sufficient remembrance
vnto you, that you neuer water any of these Gilloflowers, nor yet indeede any other
fine herbe or plant with cold water, such as you haue presently before drawne out from
a pumpe or Well, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> but with such water as hath stood open in the aire in a cisterne,
tubbe, or pot, for one whole day at the least; if it be two or three daies it will be neuer
the worse, but rather the better, as I haue related before: yet take especiall heede that
you doe not giue them too much to ouer-glut them at any time, but temperately to ir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>rorate,
bedew or sprinkle them often. From the seedes of these Gilloflowers hath risen
both white, red, blush, stamell, tawny lighter and sadder, marbled, speckled, striped,
flaked, and that in diuers manners, both single and double flowers, as you shall
see them set downe in a more ample manner in the <a href="#Chap_2_LXIX" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 59">Chapter of Gilloflowers</a>. And
thus much for their encrease by the two wayes of planting and sowing: For as for a
third way, by grafting one into or vpon another, I know none such to be true, nor to
be of any more worth than an old Wiues tale, both nature, reason, and experience, all
contesting against such an idle fancy, let men make what ostentation they please. It
now resteth, that we also shew you the manner how to preserue them, as well in Summer
from all noysome and hurtfull things, as in the Winter and Spring from the sharp
and chilling colds, and the sharpe and bitter killing windes in March. The hurtfull
things in the Summer are especially these, too much heate of the Sunne which scorcheth
them, which you must be carefull to preuent, by placing boughes, boords, clothes
or mats, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> before them, if they bee in the ground; or else if they bee in pots, to
remoue them into the shadow, to giue them refreshing from the heate, and giue
them water also for their life: too much water, or too little is another annoyance,
which you must order as you see there is iust cause, by withholding or giuing them water
gently out of a watering pot, and not cast on by dishfuls: Some also to water their
Gilloflowers, vse to set their pots into tubbes or pots halfe full of water, that so the
water may soake in at the lower holes in each flower pot, to giue moisture to the roots
of the Gilloflowers onely, without casting any water vpon the leaues, and assuredly it
is an excellent way to moisten the rootes so sufficiently at one time, that it doth saue a
great deale of paines many other times. Earwickes are a most infestuous vermine, to
spoyle the whole beauty of your flowers, and that in one night or day; for these creatures
delighting to creepe, into any hollow or shadowie place, doe creepe into the
long greene pods of the Gilloflowers, and doe eate away the white bottomes of their
leaues, which are sweete, whereby the leaues of the flowers being loose, doe either
fall away of themselues before, or when they are gathered, or handled, or presently
wither within the pods before they are gathered, and blowne away with the winde.
To auoide which inconuenience, many haue deuised many waies and inuentions to
destroy them, as pots with double verges or brimmes, containing a hollow gutter betweene
them, which being filled with water, will not suffer these small vermine to
passe ouer it to the Gilloflowers to spoile them. Others haue vsed old shooes, and such
like hollow things to bee set by them to take them in: but the best and most vsuall
things now vsed, are eyther long hollow canes, or else beasts hoofes, which being
turned downe vpon stickes ends set into the ground, or into the pots of earth, will
soone drawe into them many Earwickes, lying hid therein from sunne, winde, and
raine, and by care and diligence may soone bee destroyed, if euery morning and euening
one take the hoofes gently off from the stickes, and knocking them against the
ground in a plain allie, shake out all the Earwicks that are crept into them, which quickly
with ones foot may be trode to peeces. For sodain blasting with thunder and lightening,
or fierce sharp windes, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> I know no other remedy, vnlesse you can couer
them therefrom when you first foresee the danger, but patiently to abide the losse,
whatsoeuer some haue aduised, to lay litter about them to auoide blasting; for if any
shall make tryall thereof, I am in doubt, he shall more endanger his rootes thereby, being
the Summer time, when any such feare of blasting is, than any wise saue them from
it, or doe them any good. For the Winter preseruation of them, some haue aduised to
couer them with Bee-hiues, or else with small Willow stickes, prickt crossewise into
the ground ouer your flowers, and bowed archwise, and with litter laid thereon,
to couer the Gilloflowers quite ouer, after they haue been sprinkled with sope ashes
and lyme mixt together: and this way is commended by some that haue written thereof,
to be such an admirable defence vnto them in Winter, that neither Ants, nor
Snailes, nor Earwickes shall touch them, because of the sope ashes and lyme, and neyther
frosts nor storms shall hurt them, because of the litter which so well will defend
them; and hereby also your Gilloflowers will bee ready to flower not onely in the
Spring very early, but euen all the Winter. But whosoeuer shall follow these directions,
may peraduenture finde them in some part true, as they are there set downe for
the Winter time, and while they are kept close and couered; but let them bee assured,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
that all such plants, or the most part of them, will certainely perish and dye before the
Summer be at an end: for the sope ashes and lyme will burne vp and spoile any herbe;
and againe it is impossible for any plant that is kept so warme in Winter, to abide eyther
the cold or the winde in the Spring following, or any heate of the Sun, but that
both of them will scorch them, and carry them quite away. One great hurt vnto them,
and to all other herbes that wee preserue in Winter, is to suffer the snow to lye vpon
them any time after it is fallen, for that it doth so chill them, that the Sunne afterward,
although in Winter, doth scorch them and burne them vp: looke therefore vnto
your Gilloflowers in those times, and shake or strike off the snow gently off from
them, not suffering it to abide on them any day or night if you can; for assure your
selfe, if it doth not abide on them, the better they will be. The frosts likewise is another
great annoyance vnto them, to corrupt the rootes, and to cause them to swell,
rot, and break: to preuent which inconuenience, I would aduise you to take the straw
or litter of your horse stable, and lay some thereof about euery roote of your Gilloflowers
(especially those of the best account) close vnto them vpon the ground, but be
as carefull as you can, that none thereof lye vpon the greene leaues, or as little as may
be, and by this onely way haue they been better defended from the frosts that spoile
them in Winter, then by any other that I haue seen or knowne. The windes in March,
and Sunneshine dayes then, are one of the greatest inconueniences that happeneth vnto
them; for they that haue had hundreds of plants, that haue kept faire and greene all
the Winter vntill the beginning or middle of March, before the end thereof, haue
had scarce one of many, that either hath not vtterly perished, or been so tainted, that
quickly after haue not been lost; which hath happened chiefly by the neglect of these
cautions before specified, or in not defending them from the bitter sharp windes and
sunne in this moneth of March. You shall therefore for their better preseruation, besides
the litter laid about the rootes, which I aduise you not to remoue as yet, shelter
them somewhat from the windes, with eyther bottomlesse pots, pales, or such like
things, to keep away the violent force both of windes and sun for that moneth, and for
some time before &amp; after it also: yet so, that they be not couered close aboue, but open
to receiue ayre &amp; raine. Some also vse to wind withes of hey or straw about the rootes
of their Gilloflowers, and fasten them with stickes thrust into the ground, which
serue very well in the stead of the other. Thus haue I shewed you the whole preseruation
of these worthy and dainty flowers, with the whole manner of ordering them
for their encrease: if any one haue any other better way, I shall be as willing to learne
it of them, as I haue beene to giue them or any others the knowledge of that I haue
here set downe.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="Chap_1_IX" title="Chapter 9: That there is no art; double flowers"><span class="main-title"><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span><br></span>

<i class="sub-title">That there is not any art whereby any flower may be made to grow double, that was naturally
single, nor of any other sent or colour than it first had by nature; nor that the
sowing or planting of herbes one deeper than other, will cause them
to be in flower one after another, euery moneth
in the yeare.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e wonderfull desire that many haue to see faire, double, and sweete flowers,
hath transported them beyond both reason and nature, feigning and boasting
often of what they would haue, as if they had it. And I thinke, from this desire
and boasting hath risen all the false tales and reports, of making flowers double as they
list, and of giuing them colour and sent as they please, and to flower likewise at what
time they will, I doubt not, but that some of these errours are ancient, and continued
long by tradition, and others are of later inuention: and therefore the more to be condemned,
that men of wit and iudgement in these dayes should expose themselues in
their writings, to be rather laughed at, then beleeued for such idle tales. And although
in the contradiction of them, I know I shall vndergoe many calumnies, yet notwithstanding,
I will endeauour to set downe and declare so much, as I hope may by reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
perswade many in the truth, although I cannot hope of all, some being so strongly
wedded to their owne will, and the errours they haue beene bred in, that no reason
may alter them. First therefore I say, that if there were any art to make some flowers
to grow double, that naturally were single, by the same art, all sorts of flowers that are
single by nature, may be made to grow double: but the sorts of flowers that are single
by nature, whereof some are double, were neuer made double by art; for many sorts
abide still single, whereof there was neuer seene double: and therefore there is no
such art in any mans knowledge to bring it to passe. If any man shall say, that because
there are many flowers double, whereof there are single also of the same kinde, as for
example, Violets, Marigolds, Daisyes, Daffodils, Anemones, and many other, that
therefore those double flowers were so made by the art of man: <i>viz.</i> by the obseruation
of the change of the Moone, the constellations or coniunctions of Planets, or
some other Starres or celestiall bodies. Although I doe confesse and acknowledge,
that I thinke some constellations, and peraduenture changes of the Moone, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> were
appointed by the God of nature, as conducing and helping to the making of those
flowers double, that nature hath so produced, yet I doe deny, that any man hath or
shall euer be able to proue, that it was done by any art of man, or that any man can tell
the true causes and seasons, what changes of the Moone, or constellations of the Planets,
wrought together for the producing of those double flowers, or can imitate nature,
or rather the God of nature, to doe the like. If it shall bee demanded, From
whence then came these double flowers that we haue, if they were not so made by art?
I answer, that assuredly all such flowers did first grow wilde, and were so found double,
as they doe now grow in Gardens, but for how long before they were found they
became double, no man can tell; we onely haue them as nature hath produced them,
and so they remaine. Againe, if any shall say, that it is likely that these double flowers
were forced so to be, by the often planting and transplanting of them, because it is obserued
in most of them, that if they stand long in any one place, and not be often remoued,
they will grow still lesse double, and in the end turne single. I doe confesse,
that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Facilior est descensus quàm ascensus</i>, and that the vnfruitfulnesse of the ground they
are planted in, or the neglect or little care had of them, or the growing of them
too thicke or too long, are oftentimes a cause of the diminishing of the flowers
doublenesse; but withall you shall obserue, that the same rootes that did beare double
flowers (and not any other that neuer were double before) haue returned to their former
doublenesse againe, by good ordering and looking vnto: single flowers haue only
beene made somewhat fairer or larger, by being planted in the richer and more fruitfull
ground of the Garden, than they were found wilde by nature; but neuer made to
grow double, as that which is naturally so found of it selfe: For I will shew you mine
owne experience in the matter. I haue been as inquisitiue as any man might be, with
euery one I knew, that made any such report, or that I thought could say any thing
therein, but I neuer could finde any one, that could assuredly resolue me, that he knew
certainly any such thing to be done: all that they could say was but report, for the obseruation
of the Moone, to remoue plants before the change, that is, as some say, the
full of the Moone, others the new Moone, whereupon I haue made tryall at many
times, and in many sorts of plants, accordingly, and as I thought fit, by planting &amp; transplanting
them, but I could neuer see the effect desired, but rather in many of them the
losse of my plants. And were there indeed such a certaine art, to make single flowers
to grow double, it would haue beene knowne certainly to some that would practise it,
and there are so many single flowers, whereof there were neuer any of the kinde seene
double, that to produce such of them to be double, would procure both credit and
coyne enough to him that should vse it; but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vltra posse non est esse</i>: and therefore let no
man beleeue any such reports, bee they neuer so ancient; for they are but meere tales
and fables. Concerning colours and sents, the many rules and directions extant in manie
mens writings, to cause flowers to grow yellow, red, greene, or white, that neuer
were so naturally, as also to be of the sent of Cinamon, Muske, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> would almost perswade
any, that the matters thus set downe by such persons, and with some shew of
probability, were constant and assured proofes thereof: but when they come to the
triall, they all vanish away like smoake. I will in a few words shew you the matters and
manners of their proceedings to effect this purpose: First (they say) if you shall steepe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
your seedes in the lees of red Wine, you shall haue the flowers of those plants to be of
a purple colour. If you will haue Lillies or Gilloflowers to be of a Scarlet red colour,
you shall put Vermillion or Cynaber betweene the rinde and the small heads growing
about the roote: if you will haue them blew, you shall dissolue Azur or Byse between
the rinde and the heads: if yellow, Orpiment: if greene, Vardigrease, and thus of
any other colour. Others doe aduise to open the head of the roote, and poure into it
any colour dissolued, so that there be no fretting or corroding thing therein for feare
of hurting the roote, and looke what colour you put in, iust such or neare vnto it shall
the colour of the flower bee. Some againe doe aduise to water the plants you would
haue changed, with such coloured liquor as you desire the flower to be of, and they
shall grow to be so. Also to make Roses to bee yellow, that you should graft a white
Rose (some say a Damaske) vpon a Broome stalke, and the flower will be yellow, supposing
because the Broome flower is yellow, therefore the Rose will be yellow. Some
affirme the like, if a Rose be grafted on a Barbery bush, because both the blossome and
the barke of the Barbery is yellow, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> In the like manner for sents, they haue set
downe in their writings, that by putting Cloues, Muske, Cinamon, Benzoin, or any
other such sweete thing, bruised with Rose water, betweene the barke and the body of
trees, the fruit of them will smell and taste of the same that is put vnto them; and if
they bee put vnto the toppe of the rootes, or else bound vnto the head of the roote,
they will cause the flowers to smell of that sent the matter put vnto them is of: as also
to steep the seeds of Roses, and other plants in the water of such like sweet things, and
then to sowe them, and water them morning and euening with such like liquor, vntill
they be growne vp; besides a number of such like rules and directions set downe in
bookes so confidently, as if the matters were without all doubt or question: whenas
without all doubt and question I will assure you, that they are all but meere idle
tales &amp; fancies, without all reason or truth, or shadow of reason or truth: For sents and
colours are both such qualities as follow the essence of plants, euen as formes are also;
and one may as well make any plant to grow of what forme you will, as to make it of
what sent or colour you will; and if any man can forme plants at his will and pleasure,
he can doe as much as God himselfe that created them. For the things they would
adde vnto the plants to giue them colour, are all corporeall, or of a bodily substance,
and whatsoeuer should giue any colour vnto a liuing and growing plant, must be spirituall:
for no solide corporeall substance can ioyne it selfe with the life and essence
of an herbe or tree, and the spirituall part of the colour thereof is not the same with
the bodily substance, but is a meere vapour that riseth from the substance, and seedeth
the plant, whereby it groweth, so that there is no ground or colour of reason, that
a substantiall colour should giue colour to a growing herbe or tree: but for sent
(which is a meere vapour) you will say there is more probability. Yet consider also,
that what sweete sent soeuer you binde or put vnto the rootes of herbes or trees, must
be either buried, or as good as buried in the earth, or barke of the tree, whereby the
substance will in a small time corrupt and rot, and before it can ioyne it selfe with the
life, spirit, and essence of the plant, the sent also will perish with the substance: For no
heterogeneall things can bee mixed naturally together, as Iron and Clay; and no other
thing but homogeneall, can be nourishment or conuertible into the substance of man
or beast: And as the stomach of man or beast altereth both formes, sents, and colours
of all digestible things; so whatsoeuer sent or colour is wholsome, and not poysonfull
to nature, being receiued into the body of man or beast, doth neither change the bloud
or skinne into that colour or sent was receiued: no more doth any colour or sent to
any plant; for the plants are onely nourished by the moisture they draw naturally vnto
them, be it of wine or any other liquor is put vnto them, and not by any corporeal
substance, or heterogeneall vapour or sent, because the earth like vnto the stomach
doth soone alter them, before they are conuerted into the nature and substance of the
plant. Now for the last part I vndertooke to confute, that no man can by art make all
flowers to spring at what time of the yeare hee will; although, as I haue here before
shewed there are flowers for euery moneth of the yeare, yet I hope there is not any
one, that hath any knowledge in flowers and gardening, but knoweth that the flowers
that appeare and shew themselues in the seuerall moneths of the yeare, are not one and
the same, and so made to flower by art; but that they are seuerall sorts of plants, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
will flower naturally and constantly in the same moneths one yeare, that they vse to
doe in another, or with but little alteration, if the yeares proue not alike kindly: As
for example, those plants that doe flower in Ianuary and February, will by no art of
industry of man be caused to flower in Summer or in Autumne; and those that flower
in Aprill and May, will not flower in Ianuary or February; or those in Iuly, August,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> either in the Winter or Spring: but euery one knoweth their owne appointed naturall
times, which they constantly obserue and keepe, according to the temperature
of the yeare, or the temper of the climate, being further North or South, to bring
them on earlier or later, as it doth with all other fruits, flowers, and growing greene
herbes, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> except that by chance, some one or other extraordinarily may be hindered
in their due season of flowring, and so giue their flowers out of time, or else to
giue their flowers twice in the yeare, by the superaboundance of nourishment, of the
mildnesse of the season, by moderate showers of raine, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> as it sometimes also happeneth
with fruits, which chance, as it is seldome, and not constant, so we then terme
it but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lusus naturæ</i>: or else by forcing them in hot stoues, which then will perish, when
they haue giuen their flowers or fruits. It is not then, as some haue written, the sowing
of the seedes of Lillies, or any other plants a foote deepe, or halfe a foote deepe,
or two inches deepe, that will cause them to be in flower one after, another, as they are
sowne euery moneth of the yeare; for it were too grosse to thinke, that any man of
reason and iudgement would so beleeue. Nor is it like wise in the power of any man,
to make the same plants to abide a moneth, two, or three, or longer in their beauty of
flowring, then naturally they vse to doe; for I thinke that were no humane art, but a
supernaturall worke. For nature still bendeth and tendeth to perfection, that is, after
flowring to giue fruit or seede; nor can it bee hindered in the course thereof without
manifest danger of destruction, euen as it is in all other fruit-bearing creatures, which
stay no longer, then their appointed time is naturall vnto them, without apparent
damage. Some things I grant may be so ordered in the planting, that according to
that order and time which is obserued in their planting, they shall shew forth their
faire flowers, and they are Anemones, which will in that manner, that I haue shewed
in the <a href="#Chap_2_XXV_a" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 25">worke following</a>, flower in seuerall moneths of the yeare; which thing as it is
incident to none or very few other plants, and is found out but of late, so likewise is it
knowne but vnto a very few. Thus haue I shewed you the true solution of these
doubts: And although they haue not beene amplified with such Philosophicall arguments
and reasons, as one of greater learning might haue done, yet are they truely and
sincerely set downe, that they may serue <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tanquam galeatum</i>, against all the calumnies
and obiections of wilfull and obdurate persons, that will not be reformed. As first,
that all double flowers were so found wilde, being the worke of nature alone, and not
the art of any man, by planting or transplanting, at or before the new or full Moone,
or any other obseruation of time, that hath caused the flower to grow double, that naturally
was single: Secondly, that the rules and directions, to cause flowers to bee of
contrary or different colours or sents, from that they were or would be naturally, are
meere fancies of men, without any ground of reason of truth. And thirdly, that there
is no power or art in man, to cause flowers to shew their beauty diuers moneths before
their naturall time, nor to abide in their beauty longer then the appointed naturall
time for euery one of them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">B<span class="looks_big">e</span>cause the Lilly is the more stately flower among manie:
and amongst the wonderfull varietie of Lillies,
knowne to vs in these daies, much more then in former
times, whereof some are white, others blush, some purple,
others red or yellow, some spotted, others without
spots, some standing vpright, others hanging or
turning downewards, The Crowne Imperiall for his
stately beautifulness, deserueth the first place in this our
Garden of delight, to be here entreated of before all other
Lillies; but because it is so well knowne to most
persons, being in a manner euery where common, I shall
neede onely to giue you a relation of the chiefe parts
thereof (as I intend in such other things) which are these: The roote is yellowish on
the outside, composed of fewer, but much thicker scales, then any other Lilly but the
Persian, and doth grow sometimes to be as great as a pretty bigge childes head, but
somewhat flat withall, from the sides whereof, and not from the bottome, it shooteth
forth thicke long fibres, which perish euery yeare, hauing a hole in the midst thereof,
at the end of the yeare, when the old stalke is dry and withered, and out of the which
a new stalke doth spring againe (from a bud or head to be seen within the hollownesse
on the one side) the yeare following: the stalke then filling vp the hollownesse, riseth
vp three or foure, foote high, being great, round, and of a purplish colour at the bottome,
but greene aboue, beset from thence to the middle thereof with many long and
broad greene leaues, very like to the leaues of our ordinary white Lilly, but somewhat
shorter and narrower, confusedly without order, and from the middle is bare or naked
without leaues, for a certaine space vpwards, and then beareth foure, sixe, or tenne
flowers, more or lesse, according to the age of the plant, and the fertility of the soyle
where it groweth: The buddes at the first appearing are whitish, standing vpright among
a bush or tuft of greene leaues, smaller then those below, and standing aboue
the flowers, after a while they turne themselues, and hang downewards euerie
one vpon his owne footestalke, round about the great stemme or stalke, sometimes of
an euen depth, and other while one lower or higher than another, which flowers are
neare the forme of an ordinary Lilly, yet somewhat lesser and closer, consisting of
sixe leaues of an Orange colour, striped with purplish lines and veines, which adde
a great grace to the flowers: At the bottome of the flower next vnto the stalke, euery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
leafe thereof hath on the outside a certaine bunch or eminence, of a darke purplish colour,
and on the inside there lyeth in those hollow bunched places, certaine cleare
drops of water like vnto pearles, of a very sweete taste almost like sugar: in the midst
of each flower is a long white stile or pointell, forked or diuided at the end, and sixe
white chiues tipt with yellowish pendents, standing close about it: after the flowers
are past, appeare sixe square seede vessels standing vpright, winged as it were or welted
on the edges, yet seeming but three square, because each couple of those welted edges
are ioyned closer together, wherein are contained broad, flat, and thinne seedes, of a
pale brownish colour, like vnto other Lillies, but much greater and thicker also. The
stalke of this plant doth oftentimes grow flat, two, three, or foure fingers broad, and
then beareth many more flowers, but for the most part smaller then when it beareth
round stalkes. And sometimes it happeneth the stalke to be diuided at the top, carrying
two or three tufts of greene leaues, without any flowers on them. And sometimes
likewise, to beare two or three rowes or crownes of flowers one aboue another vpon
one stalke, which is seldome and scarce seene, and besides, is but meere accidentall:
the whole plant and euery part thereof, as well rootes, as leaues and flowers, doe smell
somewhat strong as it were the fauour of a Foxe, so that if any doe but come neare it,
he cannot but smell it, which yet is not vnwholsome.</p>

<p>I haue not obserued any variety in the colour of this flower, more then that it will
be fairer in a cleare open ayre, and paler, or as it were blasted in a muddy or smoakie
ayre. And although some haue boasted of one with white flowers, yet I could neuer
heare that any such hath endured in one vniforme colour.</p>

<p>It flowereth most commonly in the end of March, if the weather be milde,

in the end of May.</p>

the stalke, stand many flowers one aboue another round about it, with leaues at the
foote of euery one of them, each whereof is pendulous or hanging downe the head,
like vnto the Crowne Imperiall, and not turning vp any of the flowers againe, but
smaller than in any other kinde of Lilly, yea not so bigge as the flower of a Fritillaria,
consisting of sixe leaues a peece, of a dead or ouerworne purplish colour, hauing in the
midst a small long pointell, with certaine chiues tipt with yellow pendents: after the
flowers are past (which abide open a long time, and for the most part flower by degrees,
the lowest first, and so vpwards) if the weather be temperate, come sixe square
heads or seede vessels, seeming to be but three square, by reason of the wings, very like
to the heads of the Crowne Imperiall, but smaller and shorter, wherein are contained

  <span class="line sub-title">The Martagon Imperiall.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">V<span class="looks_big">n</span>der this title of <i>Lilium Montanum</i>, or <i>Lilium Siluestre</i>, I do comprehend only
those kindes of Lillies, which carry diuers circles of greene leaues set together
at certaine distances, round about the stalke, and not sparsedly as the two former,
and as other kindes that follow, doe. And although there bee many of this sort,
yet because their chiefest difference is in the colour of the flower, wee will containe
them all in one Chapter, and begin with the most stately of them all, because of the
number of flowers it beareth vpon one stalke. The Imperiall Lilly hath a scaly roote,
like vnto all the rest of the Lillies, but of a paler yellow colour, closely compact or set
together, being short and small oftentimes, in comparison of the greatnesse of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
stemme growing from it. The stalke is brownish and round at the bottome, and sometimes
flat from the middle vpwards, three foote high or more, beset at certaine distances
with rondles or circles of many broad leaues, larger and broader for the most part
than any other of this kinde, and of a darke green colour: It hath two or three, and
sometimes foure of these rondles or circles of leaues, and bare without any leafe betweene;
but aboue toward the tops of the stalkes, it hath here and there some leaues
vpon it, but smaller than any of the other leaues: at the toppe of the stalke come forth
many flowers, sometime three or foure score, thicke thrust, or confusedly set together,
and not thinne or sparsedly one aboue another, as in the lesser of this kinde of Mountaine
Lilly. It hath been sometimes also obserued in this kinde, that it hath borne manie
flowers at three seuerall spaces of the stalke, one aboue another, which hath made
a goodly shew; each flower whereof is pendulous, hanging downe, and each leafe of
the flower turning vp againe, being thicke or fleshy, of a fine delayed purple colour,
spotted with many blackish or brownish spots, of a very pleasant sweet sent, which maketh
it the more acceptable: in the middle of the flower hangeth downe a stile or
pointell, knobbed or buttoned at the end with sixe yellow chiues, tipt with loose pendents
of an Orient red or Vermillion colour, which will easily sticke like dust vpon
any thing that toucheth them: the heads or seede vessels are small and round, with
small edges about them, wherein is contained flat browne seede like other Lillies, but
lesser. This root is very apt to encrease or set of, as we call it, wherby the plant seldome
commeth to so great a head of flowers, but riseth vp with many stalkes, and then carry
fewer flowers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Martagon
Imperiale
flore non punctato.</i></div>

<p>Of this kinde there is sometimes one found, that beareth flowers without any spots:
the leaues whereof and stalke likewise are paler, but not else differing.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Martagon flore albo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The White Martagon.</span>
</h4>

<p>We haue also some other of this kind, the first wherof hath his stalke &amp; leafe greener
than the former, the stalke is a little higher, but not bearing so thicke a head of flowers,
although much more plentifull than the lesser Mountaine Lilly, being altogether of a
fine white colour, without any spots, or but very few, and that but sometimes also: the
pendents in the middle of this flower are not red, as the former, but yellow; the roote
of this, and of the other two that follow, are of a pale yellow colour, the cloues or
scales of them being brittle, and not closely compact, yet so as if two, and sometimes
three scales or cloues grew one vpon the head or vpperpart of another; which difference
is a speciall note to know these three kindes, from any other kinde of Mountaine
Lilly, as in all old rootes that I haue seene, I haue obserued, as also in them that are reasonably
well growne, but in the young rootes it is not yet so manifest.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Martagon flore albo maculato.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The White spotted Martagon.</span>
</h4>

<p>The second is like vnto the first in all things, saue in this, that the flowers hereof are
not altogether so white, and besides hath many reddish spots on the inside of the leaues
of the flower, and the stalke also is not so greene but brownish.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Martagon flore carneo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The blush Martagon.</span>
</h4>

<p>A third sort there is of this kinde, whole flowers are wholly of a delayed flesh colour,
with many spots on the flowers, and this is the difference hereof from the former.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lilium Montanum siue siluestre minus.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The lesser Mountaine Lilly.</span>
</h4>

<p>The lesser Mountaine Lilly is so like in root vnto the greater that is first described,
that it is hard to distinguish them asunder; but when this is sprung vp out of the ground,
which is a moneth after the first: it also carrieth his leaues in rondles about the stalke,
although not altogether so great nor so many. The flowers are more thinly set on the
stalkes one aboue another, with more distance betweene each flower than the former,
and are of a little deeper flesh colour or purple, spotted in the same manner. The buds
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>or heads of flowers, in some of these before they be blowne, are hoary white, or
hairie, whereas in others, there is no hoarinesse at all, but the buddes are smooth
and purplish: in other things this differeth not from the former.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lilium Montanum
non maculatum.</i></div>

<p>Of this sort also there is one that hath but few spots on the flowers, whose colour is
somewhat paler than the other.</p>

</h4>

<p>Although this strange Lilly hath not his flowers hanging downe, and turning vp again,
as the former kinds set forth in this Chapter, yet because the green leaues stand at
seuerall ioynts as they do, I must needs insert it here, not knowing where more fitly to
place it. It hath a small scaly roote, with many small long fibres thereat, from whence
riseth vp a reasonable great stalke, almost as high as any of the former, bearing at three
or foure distances many long and narrow greene leaues, but not so many or so broad
as the former, with diuers ribbes in them: from among the vppermost rundle of leaues
breake forth foure or fiue flowers together, euery one standing on a long slender foote
stalke, being almost as large as a red Lilly, but a little bending downewards, and of a
faire yellow colour, spotted on the inside with diuers blackish purple spots or strakes,
hauing a middle pointell, and sixe chiues, with pendents on them.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>All these Lillies haue been found in the diuers Countries of Germany, as
Austria, Hungaria, Pannonia, Stiria, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and are all made Denisons in our
London Gardens, where they flourish as in their owne naturall places. The
last was brought into France from Canada by the French Colonie, and
from thence vnto vs.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower about the later end of Iune for the most part, yet the first
springeth out of the ground a moneth at the least before the other, which
are most vsually in flower before it, like vnto the Serotine Tulipas, all of
them being early vp, and neuer the neere.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is vsually called <i>Martagon Imperiale</i>, the Imperiall Martagon,
and is <i>Lilium Montanum maius</i>, the greatest Mountaine Lilly; for so it deserueth
the name, because of the number of flowers vpon a head or stalke.
Some haue called it <i>Lilium Sarasenicum</i>, and some <i>Hemerocallis</i>, but neither
of them doth so fitly agree vnto it.</p>

<p>The second is <i>Lilium Montanum maius flore albo</i>, and of some <i>Martagon
Imperiale flore albo</i>, but most vsually <i>Martagon flore albo</i>, the white Martagon.
The second sort of this second kinde, is called <i>Martagon flore albo maculato</i>,
the spotted white Martagon. And the third, <i>Martagon flore carneo</i>,
the blush Martagon.</p>

<p>The third kinde is called <i>Lilium Montanum</i>, the Mountaine Lilly, and
some adde the title <i>minus</i>, the lesser, to know it more distinctly from the other.
Some also <i>Lilium Siluestre</i>, as Clusius, and some others, and of Matthiolus
<i>Martagon</i>. Of diuers women here in England, from the Dutch name,
Lilly of Nazareth. The last hath his title <i>Americanum &amp; Canadense</i>, and in
English accordingly.</p>

Pomponeum
angusti folium
praecox.</i></div>

<p>1. This rare Martagon hath a scaly root closely compact, with broader and thinner
scales than others, in time growing very great, and of a more deepe yellow colour
then the former, from whence doth spring vp a round greene stalke in some plants, and
flat in others, two or three foote high, bearing a number of small, long, and narrow
greene leaues, very like vnto the leaues of Pinkes, but greener, set very thicke together,
and without order about the stalke, vp almost vnto the toppe, and lesser by degrees
vpwards, where stand many flowers, according to the age of the plant, and thriuing in
the place where it groweth; in those that are young, but a few, and more sparsedly,
and in others that are old many more, and thicker set: for I haue reckoned threescore
flowers and more, growing thicke together on one plant with mee, and an hundred
flowers on another: these flowers are of a pale or yellowish red colour, and not so
deep red as the red Martagon of Constantinople, hereafter set down, nor fully so large:
yet of the same fashion, that is, euery flower hanging downe, and turning vp his leaues
againe. It is not so plentifull in bearing of seede as the other Lillies, but when it doth,
it differeth not but in being lesse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
2. <i>Martagon
angusti folium

<p>There is another, whose greene leaues are not so thicke set on the stalke, but else
differeth not but in flowring a fortnight later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
3. <i>Martagon
Pomponeum
latifolium praecox.</i></div>

<p>There is another also of this kind, so like vnto the former in root, stalk, flower, &amp; maner
of growing, that the difference is hardly discerned; but consisteth chiefly in these
two points: First, that the leaues of this are a little broader and shorter then the former;
and secondly, that it beareth his flowers a fortnight earlier than the first. In the colour
or forme of the flower, there can no difference bee discerned, nor (as I said) in any other
thing. All these Lillies doe spring very late out of the ground, euen as the yellow
Martagons doe, but are sooner in flower then any others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
4. <i>Martagon

<p>A fourth kinde hereof hath of late been knowne to vs, whose leaues are broader and

  <span class="line">The red Martagon of Constantinople.</span>
</h4>

<p>1. The red Martagon of Constantinople is become so common euery where, and so
well knowne to all louers of these delights, that I shall seeme vnto them to lose time,
to bestow many lines vpon it; yet because it is so faire a flower, and was at the first so
highly esteemed, it deserueth his place and commendations, howsoeuer encreasing
the plenty hath not made it dainty. It riseth out of the ground early in the spring, before
many other Lillies, from a great thicke yellow scaly root, bearing a round brownish
stalke, beset with many faire greene leaues confusedly thereon, but not so broad
as the common white Lilly, vpon the toppe whereof stand one, two, or three, or more
flowers, vpon long footestalkes, which hang downe their heads, and turne vp their
leaues againe, of an excellent red crimson colour, and sometimes paler, hauing a long
pointell in the middle, compassed with sixe whitish chiues, tipt with loose yellow
pendents, of a reasonable good sent, but somewhat faint. It likewise beareth seede in
heads, like vnto the other, but greater.</p>

<p>We haue another of this kinde, that groweth somewhat greater and higher, with a
larger flower, and of a deeper colour, spotted with diuers blacke spots, or strakes and
lines, as is to be seene in the Mountaine Lillies, and in some other hereafter to be described;
but is not so in the former of this kinde, which hath no shew of spots at all.
The whole plant as it is rare, so it is of much more beauty than the former.</p>

<p>Although this Martagon or Lilly bee of another Countrey, yet by reason of the
neerenesse both in leafe and flower vnto the former, may more fitly be placed next vnto
them, then in any other place. It hath his roote very like the other, but the leaues
are somewhat larger, and more sparsedly set vpon the stalke, else not much vnlike:
the flowers bend downe, and turne vp their leaues againe, but somewhat larger, and
of a bright red, tending to an Orenge colour, that is, somewhat yellowish, and not
crimson, like the other.</p>

</h4>

<p>1. This Yellow Martagon hath a great scaly or cloued roote, and yellow, like vnto
all these sorts of turning Lillies, from whence springeth vp a round greene strong
stalke, three foote high at the least, confusedly set with narrow long greene leaues,
white on the edges vp to the very toppe thereof almost, hauing diuers flowers on the
head, turning vp againe as the former doe, of a faint yellowish, or greenish yellow colour,
with many blacke spots or strakes about the middle of the leafe of euery flower,
and a forked pointell, with sixe chiues about it, tipt with reddish pendents, of a heauie
strong smell, not very pleasant to many. It beareth seede very plentifully, in great
heads, like vnto the other former Lillies, but a little paler.</p>

  <span class="line">The Yellow Martagon without spots.</span>
</h5>

<p>The other yellow Martagon differeth in no other thing from the former, but onely
that it hath no spots at all vpon any of the leaues of the flowers; agreeing with the former,
in colour, forme, height, and all things else.</p>

<p>There is yet another yellow Martagon, that hath no other difference then the time
of his flowring, which is not vntill Iuly, vnlesse in this, that the flower is of a deeper
yellow colour.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The knowledge of the first kindes of these early Martagons hath come
from Italy, from whence they haue bin sent into the Low-Countries, and to
vs, and, as it seemeth by the name, whereby they haue bin sent by some into
these parts, his originall should be from the mountaines in Macedonia.</p>

<p>The second sort is sufficiently knowne by his name, being first brought
from Constantinople, his naturall place being not farre from thence, as it
is likely. But the next sort of this second kinde, doth plainly tell vs his
place of birth to be the mountaines of Pannonia or Hungarie.</p>

<p>The third kindes grow on the Pyrenæan mountains, where they haue
been searched out, and found by diuers louers of plants, as also in the Kingdome
of Naples.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The first early Martagons flower in the end of May, or beginning of
Iune, and that is a moneth at the least before those that come from Constantinople,
which is the second kinde. The two first yellow Martagons
flower somewhat more early, then the early red Martagons, and sometimes
at the same time with them. But the third yellow Martagon, as is said, flowreth
a moneth later or more, and is in flower when the red Martagon of
Constantinople flowreth. And although the early red and yellow Martagons,
spring later then the other Martagons or Lillies, yet they are in flower
before them.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first early red Lillies or Martagons haue beene sent vnto vs by seuerall
names, as <i>Martagon Pomponeum</i>, and thereafter are called Martagon of
Pompony, and also <i>Lilium</i> or <i>Martagon Macedonicum</i>, the Lilly or Martagon
of Macedonia. They are also called by Clusius <i>Lilium rubrum præcox</i>,
the one <i>angustiore folio</i>, the other <i>latiore folio</i>. And the last of this kinde hath
the title <i>flore phæniceo</i> added or giuen vnto it, that is, the Martagon or Lilly
of Macedonia with gold red flowers.</p>

<p>The Martagons of Constantinople haue beene sent by the Turkish name
<i>Zufiniare</i>, and is called <i>Martagon</i>, or <i>Lilium Byzantinum</i> by some, and <i>Hemerocallis
Chalcedonica</i> by others; but by the name of the Martagon of Constantinople
they are most commonly receiued with vs, with the distinction
of <i>maculatum</i> to the one, to distinguish the sorts. The last kinde in this <i>classis</i>,
hath his name in his title, as it hath been sent vnto vs.</p>

<p>The Yellow Martagons are distinguished in their seuerall titles, as much
as is conuenient for them.</p>

</h4>

<p>The dwarfe red Lilly hath a scaly roote, somewhat like vnto other Lillies, but
white, and not yellow at all, and the cloues or scales thicker, shorter, and fewer in
number, then in most of the former: the stalke hereof is not aboue a foote and a halfe
high, round and greene, set confusedly with many faire and short greene leaues, on the
toppe of which doe stand sometimes but a few flowers, and sometimes many, of a faire
purplish red colour, and a little paler in the middle, euery flower standing vpright, and
not hanging downe, as in the former, on the leaues whereof here and there are some
blacke spots, lines or markes, and in the middle of the flower a long pointell, with
some chiues about it, as is in the rest of these Lillies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lilium rubrum multiplici flore.</i></div>

<p>This kinde is sometimes found to yeeld double flowers, as if all the single flowers

<p>The second red Lilly without bulbes groweth much higher then the first, and almost
as high as any other Lilly: the roote hereof is white and scaly, the leaues are
somewhat longer, and of a darke or sad greene colour; the flowers are many and
large, standing vpright as all these sorts of red Lillies doe, of a paler red colour tending
to an Orenge on the inside, with many blacke spots and lines on them, as in the
former, and more yellow on the outside: the seede vessels are like vnto the roundish
heads of other Lillies, and so are the seedes in them likewise.</p>

  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lilium minus bulbiferum.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The dwarfe bulbed Lilly.</span>
</h4>

<p>The first of the Lillies that carrieth bulbes on the stalke, hath a white scaly roote
like the former; from whence riseth vp a small round stalke, not much higher then
the first dwarfe Lilly, seeming to be edged, hauing many leaues thereon of a sad green
colour set about it, close thrust together: the greene heads for flowers, will haue a kind
of woollinesse on them, before the flowers begin to open, and betweene these heads
of flowers, as also vnder them, and among the vppermost leaues, appeare small bulbes
or heads, which being ripe if they be put into the ground, or if they fall of themselues,
will shoote forth leaues, and beare flowers within two or three yeares like the mother
plant, and so will the bulbes of the other hereafter described: the flowers of this
Lilly are of a faire gold yellow colour, shadowed ouer with a shew of purple, but not
so red as the first, or the next to bee described. This Lilly will shoote strings vnder
ground, like as the last red Lilly will doe also, whereat will grow white bulbed roots,
like the rootes of the mother plant, thereby quickly encreasing it selfe.</p>

<p>The second bulbed Lilly riseth vp with his stalke as high as any of these Lillies,
carrying many long and narrow darke greene leaues about it, and at the toppe many
faire red flowers, as large or larger then any of the former, and of a deeper red colour,
with spots on them likewise, hauing greater bulbes growing about the toppe of the

<p>The difference of this doth chiefly consist in the flower, which is composed of manie
leaues, as if many flowers went to make one, spotted with black spots, and without
any bulbes when it thus beareth, which is but accidentall, as the former double Lilly
is said to be.</p>

common kinde we haue bearing bulbes. It hath many leaues about the stalke, but not
of so sad a greene colour as the former: the flowers are of as pale a reddish yellow colour
as any of the former, and comming neerest vnto the colour of the Gold red Lilly.
This is more plentifull in bulbes, and in shooting strings, to encrease rootes vnder
ground, then the others.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lilium Album vulgare.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The ordinary White Lilly.</span>

<p>The ordinary White Lilly scarce needeth any description, it is so well knowne,
and so frequent in euery Garden; but to say somewhat thereof, as I vse to doe of euery
thing, be it neuer so common and knowne; it hath a cloued or scaly roote, yellower
and bigger then any of the red Lillies: the stalke is of a blackish greene colour, and
riseth as high as most of the Lillies, hauing many faire, broad, and long greene leaues
thereon, larger and longer beneath, and smaller vpon the stalke vpwards; the flowers
are many or few, according to the age of the plant, fertility of the soile, and time of
standing where it groweth: and stand vpon long greene footstalkes, of a faire white
colour, with a long pointell in the middle, and white chiues tipt with yellow pendents
about it; the smell is somewhat heady and strong.</p>

<p>The other White Lilly, differeth but little from the former White Lilly, either in
roote, leafe, or flower, but only that this vsually groweth with more number of flowers,
then euer we saw in our ordinary White Lilly: for I haue seene the stalke of this
Lilly turne flat, of the breadth of an hand, bearing neere two hundred flowers vpon a
head, yet most commonly it beareth not aboue a dozen, or twenty flowers, but smaller
then the ordinary, as the greene leaues are likewise.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first groweth onely in Gardens, and hath not beene declared where
it is found wilde, by any that I can heare of. The other hath beene sent from
Constantinople, among other rootes, and therefore is likely to grow in
some parts neere thereunto.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower in Iune or thereabouts, but shoote forth greene leaues in

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>It is called <i>Lilium Album</i>, the White Lilly, by most Writers; but by Poets

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>This Lilly aboue all the rest, yea, and I thinke this onely, and none of
the rest is vsed in medicines now adayes, although in former times Empericks
vsed the red; and therefore I haue spoken nothing of them in the end
of their Chapters, reseruing what is to be said in this. This hath a mollifying,
digesting, and cleansing quality, helping to suppurate tumours, and to
digest them, for which purpose the roote is much vsed. The water of the
flowers distilled, is of excellent vertue for women in trauell of childe bearing,
to procure an easie deliuery, as Matthiolus and Camerarius report. It
is vsed also of diuers women outwardly, for their faces to cleanse the skin,
and make it white and fresh. Diuers other properties there are in these
Lillies, which my purpose is not to declare in this place. Nor is it the scope
of this worke; this that hath been said is sufficient: for were it not, that I
would giue you some taste of the qualities of plants (as I said in my <a href="#Page_e" title="Go to Preface">Preface</a>)

both in roote, stalke, leafe, flower, and seede, haue (as you see here) placed it next

white, red, blacke, and yellow, besides the purple, which was first knowne; and of

<p>The ordinary checkerd Daffodill (as it is vsually called, but might more properly
be called the small checkerd Lilly) hath a small round white roote, and somewhat
flat, made as it were of two cloues, and diuided in a maner into two parts, yet ioyning
together at the bottome or seate of the roote, which holdeth them both together:
from betweene this cleft or diuision, the budde for the stalke <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> appeareth, which in
time riseth vp a foote, or a foote and a halfe high, being round and of a brownish
greene colour, especially neere vnto the ground, whereon there standeth dispersedly
foure or fiue narrow long and greene leaues, being a little hollow: at the toppe of the
stalke, betweene the vpper leaues (which are smaller then the lowest) the flower sheweth
it selfe, hanging or turning downe the head, but not turning vp againe any of his
leaues, as some of the Lillies before described doe; (sometimes this stalke beareth
two flowers, and very seldome three) consisting of sixe leaues, of a reddish purple colour,
spotted diuersly with great spots, appearing like vnto square checkers, of a deeper
colour; the inside of the flower is of a brighter colour then the outside, which
hath some greennesse at the bottome of euery leafe: within the flower there appeare
sixe c<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>hiues tipt with yellow pendents, and a three-forked stile or pointell compassing a
greene head, which when the flower is past, riseth vpright againe, and becommeth
the seede vessell, being somewhat long and round, yet hauing a small shew of edges,
flat at the head, like the head of a Lilly, and without any crowne as the Tulipa hath,
wherein is contained pale coloured flat seede, like vnto that of a Lilly, but smaller.</p>

<p>There is some variety to be seene in this flower; for in some the colour is paler, and
in others againe of a very high or deepe colour: sometimes also they haue eight leaues,
and sometimes ten or twelue, as if two flowers were made one, which some thereupon
haue called a Double Fritillaria. Some of them likewise doe flower very early, euen
with or before the early flowring Tulipas; and some againe flower not vntill a moneth

<p>The roote of this Fritillaria is somewhat rounder and closer then the former, from
whence the stalke riseth vp, being shorter and lower then in any other of these kindes,
hauing one or two leaues thereon, and at the top thereof two or three more set closer
together, which are broader, shorter, and whiter then any of them before, almost like
vnto the leaues of the yellow Fritillaria, from among which toppe leaues commeth
forth the flower, somewhat bending downe, or rather standing forth, being larger
then any of the former, and almost equall in bignesse vnto the yellow Fritillaria, of a
duskie gray colour all ouer on the outside, and of a very darke red colour on the inside,
diuersly spotted or straked: this very hardly encreaseth by the roote, and as seldome
giueth ripe seede, but flowreth with the other first sorts, and before the blacke, and abideth
lesse time in flower then any.</p>

<p>This great Fritillaria hath his roote equall to the bignesse of the rest of his parts,
from whence riseth vp one, &amp; oftentimes two stalks, hauing one, two or three flowers
a peece on them, as nature and the seasons are fitting: euery one of these flowers are
larger and greater then any of the former described, and pendulous as they are, of a
sad red or purplish colour, with many thwart lines on them, and small long markes,
which hardly seeme checkerwise, nor are so eminent or conspicuous as in the former:
the stalke is strong and high, whereon are set diuers long whitish greene leaues, larger
and broader then those of the former.</p>

<p>The white Fritillaria is so like vnto the first, that I shall not neede to make another
description of this: it shall (I hope) be sufficient to shew the chiefe differences, and so
proceed to the rest. The stalke and leaues of this are wholly greene, whereby it may
easily be knowne from the former, which, as is said, is brownish at the bottome. The
flower is white, without almost any shew of spot or marke in it, yet in some the markes
are somewhat more plainly to be seene, and in some againe there is a shew of a faint
kinde of blush colour to be seene in the flower, especially in the inside, the bottomes
of the leaues of euery flower sometimes are greenish, hauing also a small list of greene,
comming downe towards the middle of each leafe: the head or seede vessell, as also
the seede and the roote, are so like vnto the former, that the most cunning cannot distinguish
them.</p>

<p>This Fritillaria hath a round flattish white roote, very like vnto the last Fritillaria,
bearing a stalke with long greene leaues thereon, little differing from it, or the first ordinary
Fritillaria: the flower is said to be constant, composed of many leaues, being
ten at the least, and most vsually twelue, of a pale whitish purple colour, spotted like
vnto the paler ordinary Fritillaria that is early, so that one would verily thinke it were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>

former kindes, and of a meane bignesse; from the middle riseth vp a stalke a foote and
a halfe high, and sometimes higher, whereon are set without order diuers long and
somewhat broad leaues of a whitish greene colour, like vnto the leaues of the blacke
Fritillaria, but not aboue halfe so broad: the flower is somewhat small and long, not
much vnlike to the blacke for shape and fashion, but that the leaues are smaller and
rounder pointed, of a faint yellowish colour, without any shew of spots or checkers
at all, eyther within or without the flower, hauing some chiues and yellow pendents in
the middle, as is to be seene in all of them: the seede is like the first kinde.</p>

<p>This Fritillaria groweth not much lower then the former, and brownish at the rising
vp, hauing his leaues whiter, broader, and shorter then it, and almost round pointed.
The flower is greater, and larger spread then any other before, of a faire pale yellow
colour, spotted in very good order, with fine small checkers, which adde a wonderfull
pleasing beauty thereunto: it hath also some lists of greene running downe the
backe of euery leafe. It seldome giueth seede; the roote also is like the other, but not
so flat.</p>

<p>This kinde of Fritillaria riseth vp with a round and browne greene stalke, whereon
are set diuers leaues somewhat broad and short, which compasse the stalke at the bottome
of them, of a darke greene colour; at the toppe of the stalke, which bendeth a
little downewards, doe most vsually stand three or foure leaues, betweene which commeth
forth most vsually but one flower, which is longer then the last, hanging downe

<p>This small Italian Fritillaria carrieth more store of flowers on the stalke, but they

<p>The leaues of this Fritillaria are so small, narrow and long, that it hath caused them

with broader and whiter greene leaues then any of the former, bearing one, two, or
three flowers; sometimes at the toppe, being not so large as those of the ordinary purple
Fritillaria, but smaller, longer, and rounder, sometimes a little turning vp the

there are very few spots to be seene, and those from the middle onely on the inside

with no shew of spots at all, sometimes also of a more pale greene, and sometime of a
more yellow colour: the outside of the flowers doe likewise vary, for in some the outside
of the leaues are of a darke sullen yellow, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> else more pale yellow, and in other
of a darke purplish yellow colour, which in some is so deepe, and so much, that it rather
seemeth blacke then purple or yellow, and this especially about the bottome of

<p>This Fritillaria is no doubt of kindred to the last recited, it is so like, but greater in
all parts thereof, as if growing in a more fruitfull soile, it were the stronger and lustier
to beare more store of flowers: the flowers grow foure or fiue from the head together,
hanging downe round about the stalke, like vnto a Crowne Imperiall, and are of a
yellowish greene colour on the inside, spotted with a few red spots, the outside being
blackish as the former.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first of these plants was first brought to our knowledge from France,
where it groweth plentifully about Orleance; the other sorts grow in diuers
other Countries, as some in Portugall, Spaine, Italy, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> as their names
doe import, and as in time they haue been obserued by those that were curious
searchers of these rarities, haue been sent to vs.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The early kindes doe flower in the beginning of Aprill or thereabouts,
according to the mildenesse or sharpenesse of the precedent Winter. The
other doe flower after the first are past, for a moneths space one after another,
and the great yellow is very late, not flowring vntill about the middle
or end of May.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>This hath receiued diuers names: some calling it <i>Flos Meleagridis</i>, the
Ginny Hen Flower, of the variety of the colours in the flower, agreeing with
the feathers of that Bird. Some call it <i>Narcissus Caparonius</i>, of the name of
the first inuentor or finder thereof, called Noel Caperon, an Apothecary
dwelling in Orleance, at the time he first found it, and was shortly after the
finding thereof taken away in the Massacre in France. It is now generally
called <i>Fritillaria</i>, of the word <i>Fritillus</i>, which diuers doe take for the Chesse
borde or table whereon they play, whereunto, by reason of the resemblance
of the great squares or spots so like it, they did presently referre it. It is
called by Lobel <i>Lilionarcissus purpureus variegatus, &amp; sessulatus</i>, making it a
kinde of Tulipa; but as I said in the beginning of <a href="#Chap_2_VII" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 7">the Chapter</a>, it doth most
neerely resemble a small pendulous Lilly, and might therefore rightly hold
the name of <i>Lilium variegatum</i>, or in English, the checkerd Lilly. But because
the errour which first referred it to a Daffodill, is growne strong by
custome of continuance, I leaue to euery one their owne will, to call it in
English eyther Fritillaria, as it is called of most, or the checkerd Daffodill,
or the Ginnie Hen flower, or, as I doe, the checkerd Lilly. I shall not neede
in this place further to explaine the seuerall names of euery of them, hauing
giuen you them in their titles.</p>

chiefe or onely vse thereof is, to be an ornament for the Gardens of the curious

the gallant beauty of many of them, deserueth their courteous entertainment,
among many other the like pleasures.</p>

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">N<span class="looks_big">e</span>xt vnto the Lillies, and before the Narcissi or Daffodils, the discourse of Tulipas
deserueth his place, for that it partaketh of both their natures; agreeing
with the Lillies in leaues, flowers, and seede, and somewhat with the Daffodils
in rootes. There are not onely diuers kindes of Tulipas, but sundry diuersities of
colours in them, found out in these later dayes by many the searchers of natures varieties,
which haue not formerly been obserued: our age being more delighted in the
search, curiosity, and rarities of these pleasant delights, then any age I thinke before.
But indeede, this flower, aboue many other, deserueth his true commendations and
acceptance with all louers of these beauties, both for the stately aspect, and for the admirable
varietie of colours, that daily doe arise in them, farre beyond all other
plants that grow, in so much, that I doubt, although I shall in this Chapter set downe
the varieties of a great many, I shall leaue more vnspoken of, then I shall describe; for
I may well say, there is in this one plant no end of diuersity to be expected, euery yeare
yeelding a mixture and variety that hath not before been obserued, and all this arising
from the sowing of the seede. The chiefe diuision of Tulipas, is into two sorts: <i>Præcoces</i>,
early flowring Tulipas, and <i>Serotinæ</i>, late flowring Tulipas. For that sort which
is called <i>Mediæ</i> or <i>Dubiæ</i>, that is, which flower in the middle time betweene them
both, and may be thought to be a kinde or sort by it selfe, as well as any of the other
two: yet because they doe neerer participate with the <i>Serotinæ</i> then with the <i>Præcoces</i>,
not onely in the colour of the leafe, being of the same greennesse with the <i>Serotinæ</i>,
and most vsually also, for that it beareth his stalke and flower, high and large like as
the <i>Serotinæ</i> doe; but especially, for that the seede of a <i>Media Tulipa</i> did neuer bring
forth a <i>Præcox</i> flower (although I know Clusius, an industrious, learned, and painfull
searcher and publisher of these rarities, saith otherwise) so farre as euer I could, by
mine owne care or knowledge, in sowing their seede apart, or the assurance of any others,
the louers and sowers of Tulipa seede, obserue, learne, or know: and because
also that the seede of the <i>Serotinæ</i> bringeth forth <i>Medias</i>, and the seede of <i>Medias Serotinæ</i>,
they may well bee comprehended vnder the generall title of <i>Serotinæ</i>: But because
they haue generally receiued the name <i>Mediæ</i>, or middle flowring Tulipas,
to distinguish between them, and those that vsually doe flower after them; I am content
to set them downe, and speake of them seuerally, as of three sorts. Vnto the
place and ranke likewise of the <i>Præcoces</i>, or early flowring Tulipas, there are some other
seuerall kinds of Tulipas to be added, which are notably differing, not onely from the
former <i>Præcox Tulipa</i>, but euery one of them, one from another, in some speciall note
or other: as the <i>Tulipa Boloniensis flore rubro</i>, the red Bolonia Tulipa. <i>Tulipa Boloniensis
flore luteo</i>, the yellow Bolonia Tulipa. <i>Tulipa Persica</i>, Persian Tulipa. <i>Tulipa Cretica</i>,
the Candie Tulipa, and others: all which shall bee described and entreated of, euery
one apart by it selfe, in the end of the ranke of the <i>Præcoces</i>, because all of them
flower much about their time. To begin then with the <i>Præcox</i>, or early flowring Tulipas,
and after them with the <i>Medias</i> and <i>Serotinas</i>, I shall for the better method, diuide
their flowers into foure primary or principall colours, that is to say, White, Purple,
Red and Yellow, and vnder every one of these colours, set downe the seuerall varie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>ties
of mixtures we haue seene and obserued in them, that so they may be both the better
described by me, and the better conceiued by others, and euery one placed in their
proper ranke. Yet I shall in this, as I intend to doe in diuers other plants that are variable,
giue but one description in generall of the plant, and then set downe the varietie
of forme or colour afterwards briefly by themselues.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tulipa præcox.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The early flowring Tulipa.</span>
</h4>

<p>The early Tulipa (and so all other Tulipas) springeth out of the ground with his
leaues folded one within another, the first or lowest leafe riseth vp first, sharpe pointed,
and folded round together, vntill it be an inch or two aboue the ground, which
then openeth it selfe, shewing another leafe folded also in the bosome or belly of the
first, which in time likewise opening it selfe, sheweth forth a third, and sometimes a
fourth and a fifth: the lower leaues are larger then the vpper, and are faire, thicke,
broad, long, and hollow like a gutter, and sometimes crumpled on the edges, which
will hold water that falleth thereon a long time, of a pale or whitish greene colour,
(and the <i>Mediæ</i> and <i>Serotinæ</i> more greene) couered ouer as it were with a mealinesse or
hoarinesse, with an eye or shew of rednesse towards the bottome of the leaues, and the
edges in this kinde being more notable white, which are two principall notes to know
a <i>Præcox Tulipa</i> from a <i>Media</i> or <i>Serotina</i>: the stalke with the flower riseth vp in the
middle, as it were through these leaues, which in time stand one aboue another, compassing
it at certaine vnequall distances, and is often obserued to bend it selfe crookedly
downe to the ground, as if it would thrust his head thereinto, but turning vp his
head (which will be the flower) againe, afterwards standeth vpright, sometimes but
three or foure fingers or inches high, but more often halfe a foote, and a foot high, but
the <i>Medias</i>, and <i>Serotinas</i> much higher, carrying (for the most part) but one flower on
the toppe thereof, like vnto a Lilly for the forme, consisting of sixe leaues, greene at
the first, and afterwards changing into diuers and sundry seuerall colours and varieties,
the bottomes likewise of the leaues of these sometimes, but most especially of the
<i>Mediæ</i>, being as variable as the flower, which are in some yellow, or green, or blacke,
in others white, blew, purple, or tawnie; and sometimes one colour circling another:
some of them haue little or no sent at all, and some haue a better then others. After it
hath been blowne open three or foure dayes or more, it will in the heate of the Sunne
spread it selfe open, and lay it selfe almost flat to the stalke: in the middle of the flower
standeth a greene long head (which will be the seed vessell) compassed about with sixe
chiues, which doe much vary, in being sometimes of one, and sometimes of another
colour, tipt with pendents diuersly varied likewise: the head in the middle of the
flower groweth after the flower is fallen, to be long, round, and edged, as it were
three square, the edges meeting at the toppe, where it is smallest, and making as it
were a crowne (which is not seen in the head of any Lilly) and when it is ripe, diuideth
it selfe on the inside into sixe rowes, of flat, thinne, brownish, gristly seede, very like
vnto the seede of the Lillies, but brighter, stiffer, and more transparent: the roote being
well growne is round, and somewhat great, small and pointed at the toppe, and
broader, yet roundish at the bottome, with a certaine eminence or seate on the one
side, as the roote of the Colchicum hath; but not so long, or great, it hath also an
hollownesse on the one side (if it haue borne a flower) where the stalke grew, (for although
in the time of the first springing vp, vntill it shew the budde for flower, the
stalke with the leaues thereon rise vp out of the middle of the roote; yet when the
stalke is risen vp, and sheweth the budde for flower, it commeth to one side, making
an impression therein) couered ouer with a brownish thin coate or skin, like an Onion,
hauing a little woollinesse at the bottome; but white within, and firme, yet composed
of many coates, one folding within another, as the roote of the Daffodils be, of a reasonable
good taste, neyther very sweete, nor yet vnpleasant. This description may
well serue for the other Tulipas, being <i>Medias</i> or <i>Serotinas</i>, concerning their springing
and bearing, which haue not any other great variety therein worth the note, which is
not expressed here; the chiefe difference resting in the variety of the colours of the
flower, and their seuerall mixtures and markes, as I said before: sauing onely, that the
flowers of some are great and large, and of others smaller, and the leaues of some long
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>and pointed, and of others broad and round, or bluntly pointed, as shall bee shewed
in the end of the Chapter: I shall therefore onely expresse the colours, with the
mixture or composure of them, and giue you withall the names of some of them, (for
it is impossible I thinke to any man, to giue seuerall names to all varieties) as they are
called by those that chiefly delight in them with vs.</p>

  <span class="line">The Tulipa of Caffa.</span>
</h4>

<p>There is another sort or kinde of early Tulipa, differing from the former, whose
pale greene leaues being as broad and large as they, and sometimes crumpled or waued
at the edges, in some haue the edges onely of the said leaues for a good breadth, of
a whitish or whitish yellow colour, and in others, the leaues are lifted or parted with
whitish yellow and greene: the stalke riseth not vp so high as the former, and beareth
a flower at the toppe like vnto the former, in some of a reddish yellow colour, with a
russet coloured ground or bottome, and in others, of other seuerall colours: the seede
and roote is so like vnto others of this kinde, that they cannot be distinguished.</p>

<p>There is (as I doe heare) of this kinde, both <i>Præcoces</i> and <i>Serotinæ</i> early flowring,
and late flowring, whereof although wee haue not so exact knowledge, as of the rest,
yet I thought good to speake so much, as I could hitherto vnderstand of them, and
giue others leaue (if I doe not) hereafter to amplifie it.</p>

  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tulipa Boloniensis, siue Bombycina flore rubro major.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The greater red Bolonia Tulipa.</span>
</h4>

<p>There are likewise other kindes of early Tulipas to bee spoken of, and first of the
red Bolonia Tulipa; the roote whereof is plainly discerned, to be differing from all others:
for that it is longer, and not hauing so plaine an eminence at the bottome thereof,
as the former and later Tulipas, but more especially because the toppe is plentifully
stored with a yellowish silke-like woollinesse: the outside likewise or skinne is of
a brighter or paler red, not so easie to be pilled away, and runneth vnder ground both
downeright and sidewise (especially in the countrey ground and ayre, where it will
encrease aboundantly, but not either in our London ayre, or forc’t grounds) somewhat
like vnto the yellow Bolonia Tulipa next following. It shooteth out of the ground
with broad and long leaues, like the former; but neither so broad, nor of so white or
mealy a greene colour as the former, but more darke then the late flowring Tulipa,
so that this may bee easily discerned by his leafe from any other Tulipa aboue the
ground, by one that is skilfull. It beareth likewise three or foure leaues vpon the
stalke, like the former, and a flower also at the toppe of the same fashion, but that the
leaues hereof are alwayes long, and somewhat narrow, hauing a large blacke bottome,
made like vnto a cheuerne, the point whereof riseth vp vnto the middle of the
leafe, higher then any other Tulipa; the flower is of a pale red colour, nothing so
liuely as in the early or late red Tulipas, yet sweeter for the most part then any of
them, and neerest vnto the yellow Bolonia Tulipa, which is much about the same
sent.</p>

  <span class="line">The dwarfe red Bergomo Tulipa, a bigger and a lesser.</span>
</h4>

<p>There are two other sorts hereof, and because they were found about Bergomo, do
carry that name, the one bigger or lesser then another, yet neither so great as the former,
hauing very little other difference to bee obserued in them, then that they are
smaller in all parts of them.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tulipa Boloniensis flore luteo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The yellow Bolonia Tulipa.</span>
</h4>

<p>The roote of this Tulipa may likewise bee knowne from the former red (or any other
Tulipa) in that it seldome commeth to bee so bigge, and is not so woolly at the
toppe, and the skinne or outside is somewhat paler, harder, and sharper pointed: but
the bottome is like the former red, and not so eminent as the early or late Tulipas.
This beareth much longer and narrower leaues then any (except the Persian &amp; dwarfe
yellow Tulipas) and of a whitish greene colour: it beareth sometimes but one flower
on a stalke, and sometimes two or three wholly yellow, but smaller, &amp; more open then
the other kinds, and (as I said) smelleth sweete, the head for seede is smaller then in others,
and hath not that crowne at the head thereof yet the seed is like, but smaller.</p>

<p>This Tulipa is very like vnto the yellow Bolonia Tulipa, both in roote, leafe, and
flower, as also in the colour thereof, being yellow: the onely difference is, that it is
in all things lesser and lower, and is not so apt to beare, nor so plentifull to encrease by

</h4>

<p>Both these kindes of Tulipas doe so neere resemble the last kinde, that I might almost
say they were the same, but that some difference which I saw in them, maketh
mee set them apart; and consisteth in these things, the stalkes of neither of both these
rise so high, as of the first yellow Bolonia Tulipa: the leaues of both sorts are writhed
in and out at the edges, or made like a waue of the sea, lying neerer the ground, and
the flower being yellow within, is brownish or reddish on the backe, in the middle of
the three outer leaues the edges appearing yellow. Both these kindes doe differ one
from the other in nothing, but in that one is bigger, and the other smaller then the other
which I saw with Iohn Tradescante, my very good friend often remembred.</p>

  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tulipa Lusitanica, siue pumilio versicolor.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The dwarfe stript Tulipa.</span>
</h4>

<p>This dwarfe Tulipa is also of the same kindred with the three last described; for
there is no other difference in this from them, then that the flower hath some red veins
running in the leaues thereof.</p>

<p>There are two other sorts of dwarfe Tulipas with white flowers, whereof Lobel
hath made mention in the Appendix to his <i><cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aduersaria</cite></i>; the one whereof is the same
that Clusius setteth forth, vnder the title of <i>Pumilio altera</i>: but because I haue not seen

  <span class="line">The white dwarfe Tulipa.</span>

<p>But that white flower that Iohn Tradescante shewed me, and as hee saith, was deliuered
him for a white Pumilio, had a stalke longer then they set out theirs to haue,
and the flower also larger, but yet had narrower leaues then other sorts of white Tulipas

<p>Vnto these kindes, I may well adde this kinde of Tulipa also, which was sent out of
Italy, whose leaues are small, long, and narrow, and of a darke greene colour, somewhat
like vnto the leaues of an Hyacinth: the flower is small also, consisting of sixe
leaues, as all other Tulipas doe, three whereof are wholly of a red colour, and the other
three wholly of a yellow.</p>

</h4>

<p>This rare Tulipa, wherewith we haue beene but lately acquainted, doth most fitly
deserue to be described in this place, because it doth so neerely participate with the
Bolonia and Italian Tulipas, in roote, leafe, and flower: the roote hereof is small, couered
with a thicke hard blackish shell or skinne, with a yellowish woollinesse both at
the toppe, and vnder the shell. It riseth out of the ground at the first, with one very
long and small round leafe, which when it is three or foure inches high, doth open it
selfe, and shew forth another small leafe (as long almost as the former) breaking out
of the one side thereat, and after it a third, and sometimes a fourth, and a fift; but each
shorter then other, which afterwards be of the breadth of the dwarfe yellow Tulipa,
or somewhat broader but much longer then any other, and abiding more hollow, and
of the colour of the early Tulipas on the inside: the stalke riseth vp a foot and a halfe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
high sometimes, bearing one flower thereon, composed of sixe long and pointed
leaues of the forme of other small Tulipas, and not shewing much bigger then the yellow
Italian Tulipa, and, is wholly white, both inside and outside of all the leaues, except
the three outtermost, which haue on the backe of them, from the middle toward
the edges, a shew of a brownish blush or pale red colour, yet deeper in the midst, and
the edges remaining wholly white: the bottomes of all these leaues are of a darke or
dun tawnie colour, and the chiues and tippes of a darkish purple or tawnie also. This
doth beare seed but seldome in our country, that euer I could vnderstand, but when it
doth, it is small like vnto the Bolonia or dwarfe yellow Tulipas, being not so plentifull
also in parting, or setting of by the roote as they, and neuer groweth nor abideth so
great as it is brought vnto vs, and seldome likewise flowreth after the first yeare: for
the rootes for the most part with euery one grow lesse and lesse, decaying euery yeare,
and so perish for the most part by reason of the frosts and cold, and yet they haue been
set deepe to defend them, although of their owne nature they will runne downe deep
into the ground.</p>

<p>The small Tulipa of Constantinople, beareth for the most part but two leaues on
the stalke, which are faire and broad, almost like vnto the Candy Tulipa, next hereunto
to be described: the stalke it selfe riseth not aboue a foote high, bearing sometimes
but one flower, but most commonly two thereon, one below another, and are
no bigger then the flowers of the yellow Bolonia Tulipa, but differing in colour; for
this is on the outside of a purplish colour, mixed with white and greene, and on the
inside of a faire blush colour, the bottome and chiues being yellow, and the tippes or
pendents blackish: the roote is very like the yellow Bolonia Tulipa.</p>

<p>This Tulipa is of later knowledge with vs then the Persian, but doth more hardly
thriue, in regard of our cold climate; the description whereof, for so much as wee
haue knowledge, by the sight of the roote and leafe, and relation from others of the
flower, (for I haue not yet heard that it hath very often flowred in our Country) is as
followeth. It beareth faire broad leaues, resembling the leaues of a Lilly, of a greenish
colour, and not very whitish: the stalke beareth thereon one flower, larger and more
open then many other, which is either wholly white, or of a deepe red colour, or
else is variably mixed, white with a fine reddish purple, the bottomes being yellow,
with purplish chiues tipt with blackish pendents: the roote is small, and somewhat
like the dwarfe yellow Tulipa, but somewhat bigger.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tulipa Armeniaca.</i></span>

</h4>

<p>This small Tulipa is much differing from all the former (except the small or dwarfe
white Tulipas remembred by Lobel and Clusius, as is before set downe) in that it
beareth three or foure small, long, and somewhat narrow greene leaues, altogether at
one ioynt or place; the stalke being not high, and naked or without leaues from them
to the toppe, where it beareth one small flower like vnto an ordinary red Tulipa, but
somewhat more yellow, tending to an Orenge colour with a blacke bottome: the
roote is not much bigger then the ordinary yellow Bolonia Tulipa, before set downe.</p>

<p>For any other, or further description of this kinde of Tulipa, it shall not neede, hauing
giuen it sufficiently in the former early Tulipa, the maine difference consisting
first in the time of flowring, which is about a moneth after the early Tulipas, yet some
more some lesse; for euen in the <i>Præcoces</i>, or early ones, some flower a little earlier, and
later then others, and then in the colours of the flowers; for wee haue obserued many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
colours, and mixtures, or varieties of colours in the <i>Medias</i>, which we could neuer see
in the <i>Præcoces</i>, and so also some in the <i>Præcoces</i>, which are not in the <i>Medias</i>: yet there
is farre greater varieties of mixture of colours in these <i>Medias</i>, then hath been obserued
in all the <i>Præcoces</i>, (although Clusius saith otherwise) eyther by my selfe, or by any
other that I haue conuersed with about this matter, and all this hath happened by the
sowing of the seede, as I said before. I will therefore in this place not trouble you
with any further circumstance, then to distinguish them, as I haue done in the former
early Tulipas, into their foure primary colours, and vnder them, giue you their seuerall
varieties and names, for so much as hath come to my knowledge, not doubting, but
that many that haue trauelled in the sowing of the seed of Tulipas many yeares, may
obserue each of them to haue some variety that others haue not: and therefore I thinke
no one man can come to the knowledge of all particular distinctions.</p>

fourth, hath the leaues of the flower
equally almost parted, with greene and
a light purple colour, which abiding a
long time in flower, groweth in time to
be fairer marked: for at the first it doth
not shew it selfe so plainely diuided.
Some call this a greene Swisser. A fifth
hath the longest leaues standing like a
starre, consisting of greene and purple.</p>

<p>The late flowring Tulipa hath had his description expressed in the precedent discourse,
so that I shall not neede to make a repetition of what hath already beene set
downe. The greatest matter of knowledge in this kinde is this, That it hath no such
plentifull variety of colours or mixtures in his flowers, as are in the two former sorts,
but is confined within these limits here expressed, as farre as hath come to our knowledge.</p>

<p>There yet remaine many obseruations, concerning these beautifull flowers, fit to be
knowne, which could not, without too much prolixity, be comprehended within the
body of the description of them; but are reserued to bee intreated of a part by themselues.</p>

<p>All sorts of Tulipas beare vsually but one stalke, and that without any branches:
but sometimes nature is so plentifull in bearing, that it hath two or three stalkes, and
sometimes two, or more branches out of one stalke (euery stalke or branch bearing
one flower at the toppe) but this is but seldome seene; and when it doth happen once,
it is hardly seene againe in the same roote, but is a great signe, that the roote that
doth thus, being an old roote, will the same yeare part into diuers rootes, whereof
euery one, being of a reasonable greatnesse, will beare both his stalke and flower the
next yeare, agreeing with the mother plant in colour, as all the of-sets of Tulipas doe
for the most part: for although the young of-sets of some doe vary from the maine
roote, euen while it groweth with them, yet being separated, it will bee of the same
colour with the mother plant.</p>

<p>There groweth oftentimes in the <i>Medias</i>, and sometimes also in the <i>Præcoces</i>, but
more seldome, a small bulbe or roote, hard aboue the ground, at the bottome of the
stalke, and betweene it and the lower leafe, which when the stalke is dry, and it ripe,
being put into the ground, will bring forth in time a flower like vnto the mother plant,
from whence it was taken.</p>

<p>The flowers also of Tulipas consist most commonly of sixe leaues, but sometimes
they are seene to haue eight or tenne, or more leaues; but vsually, those rootes beare
but their ordinary number of sixe leaues the next yeare: the head for seede then, is
for the most part foure square, which at all other times is but three square, or when
the flower wanteth a leafe or two, as sometimes also it doth, it then is flat, hauing but
two sides.</p>

<p>The forme of the flower is also very variable; for the leaues of some Tulipas are all
sharpe pointed, or all blunt and round pointed, and many haue the three outer leaues
sharpe pointed, and the three inner round or pointed, and some contrariwise, the three
outermost round pointed, and the three inner sharpe pointed. Againe, some haue all
the leaues of the flowers long and narrow, and some haue them broader and shorter.
Some <i>Præcoces</i> also haue their flowers very large and great, equall vnto eyther the
<i>Media</i>, or <i>Serotina</i>, which most commonly are the largest, and others haue them as
small as the Bolonia Tulipa.</p>

<p>The bottomes of the leaues of the flowers are also variably diuersified, and so are
both the chiues or threeds that stand vp about the head, and the tips or pendents that
are hanging loose on the toppes of them; and by the difference of the bottomes or
chiues, many flowers are distinguished, which else are very like in colour, and alike
also marked.</p>

<p>For the smell also there is some diuersity; for that the flowers of some are very
sweete, of others nothing at all, and some betweene both, of a small sent, but not offensiue:
and yet some I haue obserued haue had a strong ill sent; but how to shew you to
distinguish them, more then by your owne sense, I cannot: for the seedes of sweete
smelling Tulipas doe not follow their mother plant, no more then they doe in the
colour.</p>

<p>And lastly, take this, which is not the least obseruation, worth the noting, that I
haue obserued in many: When they haue beene of one entire colour for diuers yeares,
yet in some yeare they haue altered very much, as if it had not beene the same, viz.
from a purple or stamell, it hath beene variably either parted, or mixed, or striped
with white, eyther in part, or through the whole flower, and so in a red or yellow
flower, that it hath had eyther red or yellow edges, or yellow or red spots, lines,
veines, or flames, running through the red or yellow colour, and sometimes it hath
happened, that three leaues haue been equally parted in the middle with red yellow,
the other three abiding of one colour, and in some the red had some yellow in it,
and the yellow some red spots in it also; whereof I haue obserued, that all such flowers,
not hauing their originall in that manner, (for some that haue such or the like
markes from the beginning, that is, from the first and second yeares flowring, are constant,
and doe not change) but as I said, were of one colour at the first, doe shew the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
weaknesse and decay of the roote, and that this extraordinary beauty in the flower, is
but as the brightnesse of a light, vpon the very extinguishing thereof, and doth plainly
declare, that it can doe his Master no more seruice, and therefore with this iollity doth
bid him good night. I know there is a common opinion among many (and very confidently
maintained) that a Tulipa with a white flower, hath changed to beare a red or
yellow, and so of the red or yellow, and other colours, that they are likewise inconstant,
as though no flowers were certaine: but I could neuer either see or heare for
certaine any such alteration, nor any other variation, but what is formerly expressed.
Let not therefore any iudicious be carried away with any such idle conceit, but rather
suspect some deceit in their Gardeners or others, by taking vp one, and putting in another
in the place, or else their owne mistaking.</p>

<p>Now for the sowing, planting, transplanting, choise, and ordering of Tulipas,
which is not the least of regard, concerning this subiect in hand, but (as I think) would
be willingly entertained; What I haue by my best endeauours learned, by mine owne
paines in almost forty yeares trauell, or from others informations, I am willing here
to set downe; not doubting, but that some may adde what hath not come to my
knowledge.</p>

<p>First, in the sowing of seedes of Tulipas, I haue not obserued (whatsoeuer others
haue written) nor could of certainty learne of others, that there doth arise from the
seedes of <i>Præcoces</i> any <i>Medias</i> or <i>Serotine</i> Tulipas, (or but very seldome) nor am certainly
assured of any: but that the seedes of all <i>Præcoces</i> (so they be not doubtfull, or
of the last flowring sorts) will bring <i>Præcoces</i>: And I am out of doubt, that I neuer saw,
nor could learne, that euer the seede of the <i>Medias</i> or <i>Serotines</i> haue giuen <i>Præcoces</i>;
but <i>Medias</i> or <i>Serotines</i>, according to their naturall kinde. But if there should bee any
degeneration, I rather incline to thinke, that it sooner commeth to passe (<i>à meliore ad
pelus</i>, for <i>facilis est descensus</i>, that is) that <i>Præcoces</i> may giue <i>Medias</i>, then that <i>Medias</i> or
<i>Serotines</i> should giue <i>Præcoces</i>.</p>

<p>For the choise of your seede to sowe. First, for the <i>Præcoces</i>, Clusius saith, that the
<i>Præcox Tulipa</i>, that beareth a white flower, is the best to giue the greatest variety of colours.
Some among vs haue reported, that they haue found great variety rise from the
seede of the red <i>Præcox</i>, which I can more hardly beleeue: but Clusius his experience
hath the greater probability, but especially if it haue some mixture of red or purple in
it. The purple I haue found to be the best, next thereunto is the purple with white
edges, and so likewise the red with yellow edges, each of them will bring most of
their owne colours. Then the choise of the best <i>Medias</i>, is to take those colours that
are light, rather white then yellow, and purple then red; yea white, not yellow, purple,
not red: but these againe to be spotted is the best, and the more the better; but
withall, or aboue all in these, respect the ground or bottome of the flower, (which in
the <i>Præcox Tulipa</i> cannot, because you shall seldome see any other ground in them but
yellow) for if the flower be white, or whitish, spotted, or edged, and straked, and the
bottome blew or purple (such as is found in the Holias, and in the Cloth of siluer), this
is beyond all other the most excellent, and out of question the choisest of an hundred,
to haue the greatest and most pleasant variety and rarity. And so in degree, the meaner,
in beauty you sowe, the lesser shall your pleasure in rarities be. Bestowe not your time
in sowing red or yellow Tulipa seede, or the diuers mixtures of them; for they will (as
I haue found by experience) seldome be worth your paines. The <i>Serotina</i>, or late flowring
Tulipa, because it is seldome seene, with any especiall beautifull variety, you may
easily your selues ghesse that it can bring forth (euen as I haue also learned) no raritie,
and little or no diuersity at all.</p>

<p>The time and manner to sowe these seedes is next to be considered. You may not
sowe them in the spring of the yeare, if you hope to haue any good of them; but in the
Autumne, or presently after they be thorough ripe and dry: yet if you sowe them not
vntill the end of October, they will come forward neuer the worse, but rather the better;
for it is often seene, that ouer early sowing causeth them to spring out of the
ground ouer early, so that if a sharp spring chance, to follow, it may go neere to
spoile all, or the most of your seede. Wee vsually sowe the same yeares seede, yet if
you chance to keepe of your owne, or haue from others such seed, as is two years old,
they will thriue and doe well enough especially if they were ripe and well gathered:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
You must not sowe them too thicke, for so doing hath lost many a pecke of good
seede, as I can tell; for if the seede lye one vpon another, that it hath not roome vpon
the sprouting, to enter and take roote in the earth, it perisheth by and by. Some vse to
tread downe the ground, where they meane to sowe their seede, and hauing sowne
them thereon, doe couer them ouer the thicknesse of a mans thumbe with fine sifted
earth, and they thinke they doe well, and haue good reason for it: for considering the
nature of the young Tulipa rootes, is to runne downe deeper into the ground, euery
yeare more then other, they thinke to hinder their quicke descent by the fastnesse of
the ground, that so they may encrease the better. This way may please some, but I
doe not vse it, nor can finde the reason sufficient; for they doe not consider, that the
stiffenesse of the earth, doth cause the rootes of the young Tulipas to bee long before
they grow great, in that a stiffe ground doth more hinder the well thriuing of the
rootes, then a loose doth, and although the rootes doe runne downe deeper in a loose
earth, yet they may easily by transplanting be holpen, and raised vp high enough. I
haue also seene some Tulipas not once remoued from their sowing to their flowring;
but if you will not lose them, you must take them vp while their leafe or stalk is fresh,
and not withered: for if you doe not follow the stalke downe to the roote, be it neuer
so deepe, you will leaue them behinde you. The ground also must be respected; for
the finer, softer, and richer the mould is, wherein you sowe your seede, the greater
shall be your encrease and varietie: Sift it therefore from all stones and rubbish, and
let it be either fat naturall ground of it selfe, or being muckt, that it bee thoroughly
rotten: but some I know, to mend their ground, doe make such a mixture of grounds,
that they marre it in the making.</p>

<p>After the seede is thus sowne, the first yeares springing bringeth forth leaues, little
bigger then the ordinary grasse leaues; the second yeare bigger, and so by degrees
euery yeare bigger then other. The leaues of the <i>Præcoces</i> while they are young, may
be discerned from the <i>Medias</i> by this note, which I haue obserued. The leaues of them
doe wholly stand vp aboue the ground, shewing the small footstalkes, whereby euerie
leafe doth stand, but the leaues of the <i>Medias</i> or <i>Serotines</i> doe neuer wholly appeare
out of the ground, but the lower part which is broad, abideth vnder the vpper face of
the earth. Those Tulipas now growing to bee three yeares old, (yet some at the second,
if the ground and ayre be correspondent) are to bee taken vp out of the ground,
wherein yee shall finde they haue runne deepe, and to be anew planted, after they haue
been a little dryed and cleansed, eyther in the same, or another ground againe, placing
them reasonable neare one vnto another, according to their greatnesse, which being
planted and couered ouer with earth againe, of about an inch or two thicknesse,
may be left vntaken vp againe for two yeare longer, if you will, or else remoued euery
yeare after, as you please; and thus by transplanting them in their due season (which
is still in the end of Iuly, or beginning of August, or thereabouts) you shall according
to your seede and soyle, haue some come to bearing, in the fifth yeare after the flowring,
(and some haue had them in the fourth, but that hath beene but few, and none of
the best, or in a rich ground) some in the sixth and seuenth, and some peraduenture, not
vntill the eighth or tenth yeare: but still remember, that as your rootes grow greater,
that in re-planting you giue them the more roome to be distant one from another,
or else the one will hinder, if not rot the other.</p>

<p>The seede of the <i>Præcoces</i> doe not thriue and come forward so fast as the <i>Medias</i> or
<i>Serotines</i>, nor doe giue any of-sets in their running downe as the <i>Medias</i> doe, which
vsually leaue a small roote at the head of the other that is runne downe euery yeare;
and besides, are more tender, and require more care and attendance then the <i>Medias</i>,
and therefore they are the more respected.</p>

<p>This is a generall and certaine rule in all Tulipas, that all the while they beare but
one leafe, they will not beare flower, whether they bee seedlings, or the of-sets of
elder rootes, or the rootes themselues, that haue heretofore borne flowers; but when
they shew a second leafe, breaking out of the first, it is a certaine signe, that it will
then beare a flower, vnlesse some casualty hinder it, as frost or raine, to nip or spoile
the bud, or other vntimely accident befall it.</p>

<p>To set or plant your best and bearing Tulipas somewhat deeper then other rootes,
I hold it the best way; for if the ground bee either cold, or lye too open to the cold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Northerne ayre, they will be the better defended therein, and not suffer the frosts or
cold to pierce them so soone: for the deepe frosts and snowes doe pinch the <i>Præcoces</i>
chiefly, if they bee too neare the vppermost crust of the earth; and therefore many,
with good successe, couer ouer their ground before Winter, with either fresh or old
rotten dung, and that will maruellously preserue them. The like course you may hold
with seedlings, to cause them to come on the forwarder, so it bee after the first yeares
sowing, and not till then.</p>

<p>To remoue Tulipas after they haue shot forth their fibres or small strings, which
grow vnder the great round rootes, (that is, from September vntill they bee in flower)
is very dangerous; for by remouing them when they haue taken fast hold in the
ground, you doe both hinder them in the bearing out their flower, and besides, put
them in hazzard to perish, at least to bee put backe from bearing for a while after, as
oftentimes I haue proued by experience: But when they are now risen to flower, and
so for any time after, you may safely take them vp if you will, and remoue them
without danger, if you haue any good regard vnto them, vnlesse it be a young bearing
roote, which you shall in so doing much hinder, because it is yet tender, by reason it
now beareth his first flower. But all Tulipa roots when their stalke and leaues are dry,
may most safely then be taken vp out of the ground, and be so kept (so that they lye in
a dry, and not in a moist place) for sixe moneths without any great harme: yea I haue
knowne them that haue had them nine moneths out of the ground, and haue done reasonable
well, but this you must vnderstand withall, that they haue not been young but
elder rootes, and they haue been orderly taken vp and preserued. The dryer you keep
a Tulipa roote the better, so as you let it not lye in the sunne or winde, which will
pierce it and spoile it.</p>

<p>Thus Gentlewomen for your delights, (for these pleasures are the delights of leasure,
which hath bred your loue &amp; liking to them, and although you are herein predominant,
yet cannot they be barred from your beloued, who I doubt not, wil share with
you in the delight as much as is fit) haue I taken this paines, to set downe, and bring to
your knowledge such rules of art, as my small skill hath enabled mee withall concerning
this subiect, which of all other, seemed fittest in this manner to be enlarged, both
for the varietie of matter, and excellency of beautie herein, and also that these rules
set forth together in one place, might saue many repetitions in other places, so that
for the planting and ordering of all other bulbous rootes, and the sowing the seedes of
them, you may haue recourse vnto these rules, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tanquam ad normam &amp; examen</i>) which
may serue in generall for all other, little diuersitie of particulars needing exception.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The greater Tulipas haue first beene sent vs from Constantinople, and
other parts of Turkie, where it is said they grow naturally wilde in the
Fields, Woods, and Mountaines; as Thracia, Macedonia, Pontus about
the Euxine Sea, Cappadocia, Bithynia, and about Tripolis and Aleppo in
Syria also: the lesser haue come from other seuerall places, as their names
doe decipher it out vnto vs; as Armenia, Persia, Candye, Portugall,
Spaine, Italy, and France. They are all now made denizens in our Gardens,
where they yeeld vs more delight, and more encrease for their proportion,
by reason of the culture, then they did vnto their owne naturals.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>These doe flower some earlier, some later, for three whole moneths together
at the least, therein adorning out a Garden most gloriously, in that
being but one kinde of flower, it is so full of variety, as no other (except the
Daffodils, which yet are not comparable, in that they yield not that alluring
pleasant variety) doe the like besides. Some of the <i>Præcoces</i> haue beene
in flower with vs, (for I speake not of their owne naturall places, where the
Winters are milder, and the Spring, earlier then ours) in the moneth of Ianuary,
when the Winter before hath beene milde, but many in February,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and all the <i>Præcoces</i>, from the beginning to the end of March, if the yeare
be kindly: at what time the <i>Medias</i> doe begin, and abide all Aprill, and
part of May, when the <i>Serotines</i> flower and fade; but this, as I said, if the
yeare be kindly, or else each kinde will be a moneth later. The seede is ripe
in Iune and Iuly, according to their early or late flowring.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>There haue beene diuers opinions among our moderne Writers, by
what name this plant was knowne to the ancient Authors. Some would
haue it be <i>Cosmosandatos</i>, of the Ancient. Dodonæus referreth it to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυπῶν</span> of
Theophrastus, in his <cite>seuenth Booke and thirteenth Chapter</cite>: but thereof
he is so briefe, that besides the bare name, wee cannot finde him to make
any further relation of forme, or quality. And Bauhinus, vpon <cite>Matthiolus
Commentaries of Dioscorides</cite>, and in his <cite>Pinax</cite> also, followeth his opinion.
Camerarius in his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hortus Medicus</cite> is of opinion, it may be referred to
the Helychrysum of Crateua. Gesner, as I thinke, first of all, and after him
Lobel, Camerarius, Clusius and many others, referre it to the Satyrium of
Dioscorides: and surely this opinion is the most probable for many reasons.
First, for that this plant doth grow very frequent in many places of
Greece, and the lesser Asia, which were no doubt sufficiently knowne both
to Theophrastus, and Dioscorides, and was accounted among bulbous
rootes, although by sundry names. And secondly, as Dioscorides setteth
forth his Satyrium, so this most commonly beareth three leaues vpon a
stalke (although sometimes with vs it hath foure or fiue) like vnto a Lilly,
whereof some are often seen to be both red, in the first springing, and also
vpon the decaying, especially in a dry time, and in a dry ground: the flower
likewise of some is white, and like a Lilly; the roote is round, and as white
within as the white of an egge, couered with a browne coate, hauing a
sweetish, but not vnpleasant taste, as any man without danger many try.
This description doth so liuely set forth this plant, that I thinke wee shall
not neede to be any longer in doubt, where to finde Dioscorides his Satyrium
Triphyllum, seeing wee haue such plenty growing with vs. And
thirdly, there is no doubt, but that it hath the same qualities, as you shall
hereafter heare further. And lastly, that plant likewise that beareth a red
flower, may very well agree with his Erythronium; for the descriptions in
Dioscorides are both alike, as are their qualities, the greatest doubt may be
in the seede, which yet may agree vnto Lin or Flaxe as fitly, or rather more
then many other plants doe, in many of his comparisons, which yet wee receiue
for currant. For the seede of Tulipas are flat, hard, and shining as the
seede of <i>Linum</i> or Flaxe, although of another colour, and bigger, as Dioscorides
himselfe setteth it downe. But if there should be a mistaking in the
writing of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λὶνου</span> for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρὶνου</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λεῖριου</span> in the Greeke Text, as the slippe is both easie and
likely, it were then out of all question the same: for the seede is very like
vnto the seede of Lillies, as any man may easily discerne that know them, or
will compare them. It is generally called by all the late Writers, <i>Tulipa</i>,
which is deriued from the name <i>Tulpan</i>, whereby the Turkes of <i>Dalmatia</i>
doe entitle their head Tyres, or Caps; and this flower being blowne, laide
open, and inuerted, doth very well resemble them. We haue receiued the
early kinde from Constantinople, by the name of <i>Cafa lale</i>, and the other
by the name of <i>Cauala lale</i>. Lobel and others doe call it <i>Lilio-narcissus</i>, because
it doth resemble a Lilly in the leafe, flower, and seede, and a Daffodil
in the roote. We call it in English the Turkes Cap, but most vsually Tulipa,
as most other Christian Countries that delight therein doe. Daleschampius
calleth it Oulada.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>Dioscorides writeth, that his first Satyrium is profitable for them that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>haue a convulsion in their necke, (which wee call a cricke in the necke) if it
be drunke in harsh (which we call red) wine.</p>

<p>That the roots of Tulipas are nourishing, there is no doubt, the pleasant,
or at least the no vnpleasant taste, may hereunto perswade; for diuers haue
had them sent by their friends from beyond Sea, and mistaking them to bee
Onions, haue vsed them as Onions in their pottage or broth, and neuer
found any cause of mislike, or any sense of euill quality produced by them,
but accounted them sweete Onions.</p>

<p>Further, I haue made tryall of them my selfe in this manner. I haue preserued
the rootes of these Tulipas in Sugar, as I haue done the rootes of Eringus,
Orchis, or any other such like, and haue found them to be almost as
pleasant as the Eringus rootes, being firme and sound, fit to be presented to
the curious; but for force of Venereous quality, I cannot say, either from my
selfe, not hauing eaten many, or from any other, on whom I haue bestowed
them: but surely, if there be any speciall propertie in the rootes of Orchis,
or some other tending to that purpose, I thinke this may as well haue it as
they. It should seeme, that Dioscorides doth attribute a great Venereous
faculty to the seede, whereof I know not any hath made any especiall experiment
with vs as yet.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere hath beene great confusion among many of our moderne Writers of
plants, in not distinguishing the manifold varieties of Daffodils; for euery one
almost, without consideration of kinde or forme, or other speciall note, giueth

very few can tell what they meane. And this their confusion, in not distinguishing
the name of <i>Narcissus</i> from <i>Pseudonarcissus</i>, is of all other in this kinde the greatest and
grossest errour. To auoide therefore that gulfe, whereof I complaine that so manie
haue bin endrenched; and to reduce the Daffodils into such a methodicall order, that
euery one may know, to what <i>Classis</i> or forme any one doth appertaine, I will first
diuide them into two principall or primary kindes: that is, into <i>Narcissos</i>, true Daffodils,
and <i>Pseudonarcissos</i>, bastard Daffodils: which distinction I hold to be most necessarie
to be set downe first of all, that euery one may be named without confusion vnder
his owne primary kind, and then to let the other parts of the subdiuision follow, as is
proper to them, and fittest to expresse them. Now to cause you to vnderstand the
difference betweene a true Daffodill and a false, is this; it consisteth onely in the flower,
(when as in all other parts they cannot bee distinguished) and chiefly in the middle
cup or chalice; for that we doe in a manner onely account those to bee <i>Pseudonarcissos</i>,
bastard Daffodils, whose middle cup is altogether as long, and sometime a little longer
then the outter leaues that doe encompasse it, so that it seemeth rather like a trunke or
long nose, then a cup or chalice, such as almost all the <i>Narcissi</i>, or true Daffodils haue;
I say almost, because I know that some of them haue their middle cup so small, that
we rather call it a crowne then a cup; and againe, some of them haue them so long,
that they may seem to be of the number of the <i>Pseudonyms</i>, or bastard Daffodils: but
yet may easily be knowne from them, in that, although the cup of some of the true
Daffodils be great, yet it is wider open at the brim of edge, and not so long and narrow
all alike as the bastard kindes are; and this is the chiefe and onely way to know how to
seuer these kindes, which rule holdeth certaine in all, except that kinde which is called
<i>Narcissus Iuncifolius reflexo flore</i>, whose cup is narrow, and as long as the leaues that
turne vp againe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, I will subdiuide each of these again apart by themselues, into foure sorts;
and first the <i>Narcissos</i>, or true Daffodils into</p>
<ul>
  <li class="intext"><i>Latifolios</i>, broad leafed Daffodils.</li>

  <li class="intext"><i>Angustifolios</i>, narrow leafed Daffodils.</li>

  <li class="intext"><i>Iuncifolios</i>, Rushe Daffodils, and</li>

  <li class="intext"><i>Marinos</i>, Sea Daffodils.</li>
</ul>
<p>These sorts againe doe comprehend vnder them some other diuisions, whereby
they may the better be distinguished, and yet still bee referred to one of those foure
former sorts: as</p>
<ul>
  <li class="intext"><i>Monanthos</i>, that is, Daffodils that beare but one flower, or two at the most vpon a
stalke, and</li>

  <li class="intext"><i>Polyanthos</i>, those that beare many flowers together vpon a stalke: as also</li>

  <li class="intext"><i>Simplici flore</i>, those that beare single flowers, and</li>

  <li class="intext"><i>Multiplici flore</i>, or <i>flore pleno</i>, that is, haue double flowers.</li>

  <li class="intext"><i>Vernales</i>, those that flower in the Spring, and among them some that are earlier; and
therefore called</li>

  <li class="intext"><i>Præcoces</i>, early flowring Daffodils, and</li>

  <li class="intext"><i>Autumnales</i>, those that flower in Autumne onely.</li>
</ul>
<p>And lastly, with the <i>Pseudonarcissos</i>, or bastard Daffodils, I will keepe the same order,
to distinguish them likewise into their foure seuerall sorts; and as with the true
Daffodils, so with these false, describe vnder euery sort: first, those that beare single
flowers, whether one or many vpon a stalke; and then those that beare double flowers,
one or many also. As for the distinctions of <i>maior</i> and <i>minor</i>, greater and lesser,
and of <i>maximus</i> and <i>minimus</i>, greatest and least, they doe not onely belong to these
Daffodils; and therefore must be vsed as occasion permitteth, but vnto all other sort
of plants. To begin therefore, I thinke fittest with that stately Daffodill, which for his
excellency carrieth the name of None such.</p>

<p>This <i>Narcissus Nompareille</i> hath three or foure long and broad leaues, of a grayish

whereof, out of a thinne skinnie huske, as all Daffodils haue, commeth forth one large
single flower, and no more vsually, consisting of sixe very pale yellow large leaues,
almost round at the point, with a large cuppe in the middle, somewhat yellower then
the leaues, the bottome whereof next vnto the stalke is narrow and round, rising wider
to the mouth, which is very large and open, and vneuenly cut in or indented about
the edges. The cup doth very well resemble the chalice, that in former dayes with vs,
and beyond the Seas is still vsed to hold the Sacramentall Wine, that is with a narrower
bottome, and a wide mouth. After the flower is past, sometimes there commeth
(for it doth not often) a round greene head, and blacke round seede therein, like

or the greatest Daffodill of all other, with a large yellow cuppe: but assuredly,
although this Daffodill doth exceed many other, both in length and
bignesse, yet the great Spanish bastard Daffodill, which shall be spoken of
hereafter, is in my perswasion oftentimes a farre higher and larger flower;
and therefore this name was giuen but relatiuely, we may call it in English,
The great None such Daffodill, or the Incomparable Daffodill, or the great
Peerlesse Daffodill, or the Nompareille Daffodill, which you will: for
they all doe answer either the French or the Latine name; and because this
name <i>Nompareille</i> is growne currant by custome, I know not well how to
alter it. The third kinde may passe with the title giuen it, without controule.
The last is very well knowne beyond the Seas, especially in the
Low Countries, and those parts, by the Lady Mattenesse Daffodill, because
Clusius receiued it from her. We may call it in English, for the correspondency
with the former, The lesser yellow Nompareille, or Peerlesse Daffodill,

  <span class="line">The Indian Daffodill with a red flower.</span>
</h5>

<p>This Indian Daffodill is so differing, both in forme, not hauing a cuppe, and in colour
being red, from the whole Family of the Daffodils (except the next that followeth,
and the Autumne Daffodils) that some might justly question the fitnesse of his
place here. But because as all the plants, whether bulbous or other, that come from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the Indies, either East or West (although they differ very notably, from those that
grow in these parts of the world) must in a generall suruey and muster be ranked euery
one, as neere as the surueiours wit will direct him, vnder some other growing with vs,
that is of neerest likenesse; Euen so vntill some other can direct his place more fitly, I
shall require you to accept of him in this, with this description that followeth, which
I must tell you also, is more by relation then knowledge, or sight of the plant it selfe.
This Daffodill hath diuers broad leaues, somewhat like vnto the common or ordinary
white Daffodill, of a grayish greene colour; from the sides whereof, as also from the
middle of them, rise vp sometimes two stalkes together, but most vsually one after another
(for very often it flowreth twice in a Summer) and often also but one stalke alone,
which is of a faint reddish colour, about a foote high or more, at the toppe
whereof, out of a deepe red skinne or huske, commeth forth one flower bending
downwards, consisting of sixe long leaues without any cup in the middle, of an excellent
red colour, tending to a crimson; three of these leaues that turne vpwards, are
somewhat larger then those three that hang downewards, hauing sixe threads or
chiues in the middle, tipt with yellow pendents, and a three forked stile longer then
the rest, and turning vp the end thereof againe: the roote is round and bigge, of a
brownish colour on the outside, and white within. This is set forth by Aldinus, Cardinall
Farnesius his Physitian, that at Rome it rose vp with stalks of flowers before
any leaues appeared.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h6 title="">The Place, Time, and Names.</h6>

<p>This naturally groweth in the West Indies, from whence it was brought
into Spaine, where it bore both in Iune and Iuly, and by the Indians in their
tongue named <span class="smcap">Azcal Xochitl</span>, and hath beene sent from Spaine, vnto
diuers louers of plants, into seuerall parts of Christendome, but haue not

</h5>

<p>Because this Daffodill is so like in flower vnto the former, although differing in colour,
I thought it the fittest place to ioyne it the next thereunto. This early Daffodill
hath three or foure short very greene leaues, so like vnto the leaues of the Autumne
Daffodill, that many may easily bee deceiued in mistaking one for another, the difference
consisting chiefly in this, that the leaues of this are not so broad or so long, nor
rise vp in Autumne: in the midst of these leaues riseth vp a short green stalke, an handfull
high, or not much higher vsually, (I speake of it as it hath often flowred with mee,
whether the cause be the coldnesse of the time wherein it flowreth, or the nature of
the plant, or of our climate, I am in some doubt; but I doe well remember, that the
stalkes of some plants, that haue flowred later with me then the first, haue by the greater
strength, and comfort of the Sunne, risen a good deale higher then the first) bearing
at the top, out of a whitish thinne skinne stripped with greene, one flower a little bending
downewards, consisting of sixe leaues, laid open almost in the same manner with
the former Indian Daffodill, whereof some doe a little turne vp their points againe, of
a faire pale yellow colour, hauing sixe white chiues within it, tipt with yellow pendents,
and a longer pointell: the roote is not very great, but blackish on the outside,
so like vnto the Autumne Daffodill, but that it is yellow vnder the first or outermost
coate, that one may easily mistake one for another.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h6 title="">The Place.</h6>

<p>It was sent vs from Constantinople among other rootes, but as wee may
ghesse by the name, it should come thither from Trapezunte or Trebizond.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h6 title="">The Time.</h6>

<p>It flowreth sometimes in December, if the former part of the Winter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>haue been milde; but most vsually about the end of Ianuary, or else in Februarie
the beginning or the end.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h6 title="">The Names.</h6>

<p>Wee doe vsually call it from the Turkish name, <i>Narcissus Trapezunticus</i>,
and some also call it <i>Narcissus vernus præcox</i>, as Clusius doth, in English,
The early Daffodill of Trebizond.</p>

this manner. It hath long limber and broad leaues, of a grayish greene colour, among
which riseth vp a stalke, bearing at the toppe out of a skinnie huske sometimes
but one flower, but most commonly two flowers, and seldome three or more, but larger
for the most part, then any that beare many flowers vpon a stalke, of a pale whitish
Creame colour, tending somewhat neare vnto the colour of a pale Primrose (which
hath caused our Countrey Gentlewomen, I thinke, to entitle it Primrose Peerlesse)
with a small round flat Crowne, rather then a cup in the middle, of a pale yellow colour,
with some pale chiues standing therein, being of a sweete, but stuffing sent: the
roote is reasonable great, and encreasing more then a better plant.</p>

riseth not so high by much, and beareth but one flower thereon, of a pure white colour,
made of six small leaues, and somewhat narrow, standing seuerally one from
another, and not so close together as the former, but appearing like a starre: the cup is
small and round, of a pale yellow colour, but saffrony about the brims, hauing six

naked hollow stalke (as all other Daffodils haue) bearing at the toppe one flower, and
seldome two, made of sixe long white leaues, standing close together about the stalke;
the cup is yellow, and so flat, that it might rather bee called a crowne: for it standeth
very close to the middle, and very open at the brimmes, circled with a reddish or purple

<p>The leaues of this Daffodill are alwayes broader then the former early one, and
some are very neare twice as broad: the flower is very like the former, being large,
and his leaues standing close one to the side of another; the ring likewise that compasseth
the yellow coronet, is sometimes of a paler reddish purple, and sometimes as
deep a red as the former: so that it differeth not in any other materiall point, then
that it flowreth not vntill the other is past and gone. The sent of this is like the former,

the flower also of this hath his sixe white leaues not so broad, but narrower, and seeming
longer then they, not closing together, but standing apart one from another, making

</h6>

<p>This Persian Daffodill differeth from all other kindes of Daffodils in his manner of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
growing, for it neuer hath leaues and flowers at one time together, wherein it is like
vnto a Colchicum, yet in roote and leafe it is a Daffodill. The roote is a little blackish
on the outside, somewhat like the roote of the Autumne Daffodill, from whence riseth
vp a naked foote stalke, bearing one pale yellow flower, breaking through a thinne
skinne, which first enclosed it, composed of six leaues, the three outermost being a
little larger then the rest, in the middle of the flower there are six small chiues, and a
longer pointell. The whole flower is of an vnpleasant sent. After the flower is past,
come vp the leaues, sometimes before Winter, but most vsually after the deepe of
Winter is past with vs, in the beginning of the yeare, which are broad, long, and of a
pale greene colour, like the leaues of other Daffodils, but not greene as the Autumne
Daffodill is, and besides they doe a little twine themselues, as some of the Pancratium,
or bastard Sea Daffodils doe.</p>

<h6 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Narcissus Autumnalis maior.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The greater Autumne or Winter Daffodill.</span>
</h6>

<p>The greater Autumne Daffodill riseth vp with three or foure faire broad and short
leaues at the first, but afterwards grow longer, of a very deepe or darke greene colour,
in the middle of which riseth vp a short, stiffe, rounded footestalke, bearing one faire yellow
flower on the head thereof (inclosed at the first in a thinne skinne, or huske) and
consisteth of six leaues as the former, with certaine chiues in the middle, as all or most
other Daffodils haue, which passeth away without shew of any seed, or head for seed,
although vnder the head there is a little greene knot, which peraduenture would beare
seede, if our sharpe Winters did not hinder it. The roote is great and round, couered
ouer with a blackish skinne or coate.</p>

  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Narcissus Autumnalis minor.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The lesser Autumne or Winter Daffodill.</span>
</h6>

<p>Clusius setteth downe, that the manner of the flowring of this lesser Daffodill, is
more like vnto the Persian Daffodill, then vnto the former greater Autumne kind; but
I doe fine that it doth in the same sort, as the greater kinde, rise vp with his leaues first,
and the flowers a while after: the flower of this is lesser, and a little paler then the
flower of the greater kinde, but consisting in like sort of six leaues, narrow and sharpe
pointed; the greene leaues also are almost of as deepe a green colour, as the greater
kinde, but smaller and narrower, and a little hollow in the middle. The roote is also
alike, but lesser, and couered with a blackish skinne as the former. This hath sometimes
borne blacke round seede in three square heads.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h6 title="">The Place.</h6>

<p>The Persian Daffodill hath beene sent sometimes, but very seldome, among
other roots from Constantinople, and it is probable by the name
whereby it was sent, that it should naturally grow in Persia.</p>

<p>The other two haue likewise beene sent from Constantinople, and as it
is thought, grow in Thracia, or thereabouts.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h6 title="">The Time.</h6>

<p>They all doe flower much about one time, that is, about the end of September,
and in October.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h6 title="">The Names.</h6>

<p>The first hath been sent by the name of <i>Serincade Persiana</i>, and thereupon
is called <i>Narcissus Persicus</i>, The Persian Daffodill.</p>

<p>The other two haue been thought by diuers to be Colchica, and so haue
they called them, vpon no other ground, but that their flower is in forme
and time somewhat like Colchicum, when as if they had marked them better,
they might plainly discerne, that in all other things they did resemble
Daffodils; but now the names of <i>Colchicum luteum maius, &amp; minus</i>, is quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
lost, time hauing worne them out, and they are called by most Herbarists

<h4 class="faux nobreak">{True Daffodils: broad leaues, many single flowers vpon a stalke}</h4>

<p>Thus farre haue I proceeded with those Daffodils, that hauing broad leaues, beare

<p>This braue and stately Daffodill hath many very long and broad leaues, of a better
green colour, then many others that are grayish, among which appeareth a stalke,
not rising to the height of the leaues, bearing at the toppe out of a skinnie hose many
faire, goodly, and large flowers, to the number of ten or twelue, if the roote bee well
growne, and stand in a warme place, euery one being larger then any of the French,
Spanish, or Turkie Daffodils, that beare many single flowers vpon a stalke, and commeth
neere vnto the bignesse of the English Daffodill, called Primrose Peerlesse, before
described, or that French kinde hereafter described, that beareth the largest
flowers, many vpon a stalke (which some would make to bee a kinde of English
Daffodill, but bearing more flowers) and of a faire shining yellow colour, hauing
large, round, and open cups or boules, yellower then the outer leaues; and is of so exceeding
sweete a sent, that it doth rather offend the senses by the aboundance thereof:
the roote is great, and couered with a blackish browne coate or skinne.</p>

<p>This lesser kinde is very neere the same with the former, but that it lacketh somewhat
of his statlinesse of height, largenesse of flower and cup (being a paler yellow)
and beauty of colour, for it beareth neither of these equall vnto the former, but

<p>Whereas the last described, came short of the beauty of the former, so this lacketh
of that beauty is in the last; for this, although it haue very long leaues, and a high
stalke, yet the flowers are neither so many, as not being aboue foure or fiue, nor so
large, being not much greater then the ordinary French Daffodill hereafter described,
nor the colour so faire, but much paler, and the cup also smaller; and herein consisteth
the chiefest differences betweene this, and both the other, but that the sent of
this is also weaker.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h6 title="">The Place.</h6>

<p>The first and the second grow in Barbary, about Argiers, and Fez, as by

<div class="std-info"><h6 title="">The Time.</h6>

<p>These Daffodils do flower very early, euen with the first sort of Daffodils,
I meane after they haue been accustomed vnto our climate: for oftentimes
vpon their first bringing ouer, they flower in Ianuary or February,
especially if they be preserued from the frosts, and kept in any warme place;
for they are very tender, and will soone perish, being left abroad.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h6 title="">The Names.</h6>

<p>The first is called by diuers in French, <i>Narcisse d’ Algiers</i> and in many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>

diuers others <i>Narcissus Africanus aureus maior</i>, we may call it in English, The
great African Daffodill, or the great Barbary Daffodill, or the great yellow
Daffodill of Argiers, which you please.</p>

<p>The second hath no other variation of name, then a diminutiue of the
former, as is set downe in the title.</p>

<p>The third is no doubt the same, that <cite>Clusius setteth downe in the twelfth
Chapter of his second Booke of the History of more rare plants</cite>, and maketh
the fourth sort, which came from Constantinople, and may also be the
same, which he maketh his fifth, which (as he saith) he receiued from Doctour
<i>Simor Touar</i> of Seuill in Spaine. Wee call it, from the place from
whence we receiued it, <i>Narcissus Byzantinus</i>, with the addition of <i>totus luteus</i>,

<p>The leaues of this Daffodill are somewhat like vnto the last, but not so broad, yet
full as long, and spring sooner out of the ground, yet not so early as the first of these
kindes: the stalke hereof is flatter, and riseth higher, bearing foure or fiue flowers,
much larger then any of this kinde; for euery one of them doth equall the English
Daffodill, before described, but whiter then it, and the yellow cup larger, and more
open then in any of the rest. The roote of this is not so great, or round, as the former,
but is more plentifull in of-sets, then any other of these French, or Italian kindes.</p>

<p>This Italian Daffodill hath his leaues as large, or larger then the second French
Daffodill, and his stalke somewhat higher, bearing many white flowers, very like vnto
the common French Daffodill, but somewhat larger also; and the yellow cup in the

<p>This French Daffodill hath diuers leaues of a grayish greene colour, not so broad
or long as the last recited Daffodill, but comming neerer vnto the second French
kinde, the flowers likewise are white, and many vpon a stalke, like thereunto, but the

<p>The affinity between this &amp; the last, (for it is not the same to be expressed vnder one

deserueth a place by himselfe. The leaues are large and long, and the flowers, being
white, are larger also then in any other, except the greatest, but the cup hereof is small

it, bearing many flowers thereon, not altogether so white, yet whiter then the former
English Daffodill, called Primrose Peerlesse, but nothing so large, and with short,
broad, and almost round leaues, standing close one vnto another: the yellow cup in

<p>The roote as well as the leaues of this Daffodill, are greater, larger, broader, and

<p>These Daffodils haue been brought vs from diuers places; The first and

they grow likewise about Mompelier, and those parts in France. They haue
been likewise sent among many other sorts of Daffodils from Constantinople,
so that I may thinke, they grow in some places neere thereunto.</p>

<p>The fourth groweth plentifully in Italy, about Pisa in Tuscane, from
whence we haue had plants to furnish our Gardens.</p>

<p>The seuenth is accounted beyond Sea to be naturall of our Country, but

<h4 class="faux nobreak">{True Daffodils: Broad leaves, double flowers}</h4>

<p>After all these Daffodils, that hauing broad leaues beare single flowers, either one or
many vpon a stalke, I shall now goe on to set forth those broad leafed Daffodils, that
carry double flowers, either one or many vpon a stalke together, in the same order
that we haue vsed before.</p>

<h5 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Narcissus albus multiplex.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The double white Daffodill.</span>
</h5>

<p>The leaues of this Daffodill are not very broad, but rather of a meane size, being of
the same largenesse with the leaues of the purple ringed Daffodill, the stalke riseth vp
to be a foote and a halfe high, bearing out of a thinne white skinne or hose, one flower
and no more, consisting of many leaues, of a faire white colour, the flower is larger
then any other double white Daffodill, hauing euery leafe, especially the outermost,
as large almost as any leafe of the single Daffodill with the yellow cup, or purple ring.
Sometimes it happeneth, that the flower is very little double, and almost single, but
that is either in a bad ground, or for that it hath stood long in a place without remouing;
for then it hath such a great encrease of rootes about it, that it draweth away into
many parts, the nourishment that should be for a few: but if you doe transplant it,
taking away the of-sets, and set his rootes single, it will then thriue, and beare his
flower as goodly and double, as I haue before described it: and is very sweete.</p>

<h5 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Narcissus mediopurpureus multiplex.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The double purple ringed Daffodill.</span>
</h5>

<p>There is little difference in the leaues of this kinde, from the leaues of the single pur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>ple
ringed Daffodill; for it is probable it is of the same kinde, but by natures gift (and
not by any humane art) made more plentifull, which abideth constant, and hath not
that dalliance, which oftentimes nature sheweth, to recreate the senses of men for the
present, and appeareth not againe in the same forme: the chiefest difference is, that the
flower (being but sometimes one on a stalke, and sometimes two) consisteth of six
white outer leaues, as large as the leaues of the single kinde, hauing many small yellow
peeces, edged with purple circles round about them, instead of a cup; and in the middle
of these peeces, stand other six white leaues, lesser then the former, and a yellow
cup edged with a purple circle likewise, parted into peeces, and they comprehend a
few other white leaues, smaller than any of the other, hauing among them some broken
peeces of the cup, with a few chiues also in the middle of the flower. The flower
is very sweete.</p>

<p>There is of this kinde another, whose flower hath not so plaine a distinction, of a
triple rowe of leaues in it: but the whole flower is confusedly set together, the outer
leaues being not so large, and the inner leaues larger then the former; the broken yellow
cuppe, which is tipt with purple, running diuersly among the leaues; so that it
sheweth a fairer, and more double flower then the former, as it is indeed.</p>

  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Narcissus medioluteus corona duplici.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The Turkie Daffodill with a double crowne.</span>
</h5>

<p>This Daffodill hath three or foure leaues, as large and long almost, as the great
double Daffodill of Constantinople next following hath: the stalke likewise is very
neere as great, but as high altogether, bearing at the toppe foure or fiue flowers, the
leaues whereof are as large, as of the first or second kinde of French Daffodils, before
described, but not altogether of so pure a white colour; and being six in number, stand
like the former single French Daffodils, but that the yellow cup in the middle of this is
thicke and double, or as it were crumpled together, not standing very high to be conspicuous,
but abiding lowe and short, so that it is not presently marked, vnlesse one
looke vpon it precisely; yet is exceeding sweete. The roote is like vnto the roote of
the purple ringed Daffodill, or somewhat bigger.</p>

  <span class="line">4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Narcissus Chalcedonicus flore pleno albo polyanthos.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The double white Daffodill of Constantinople.</span>
</h5>

<p>This beautifull and goodly Daffodill (wherewith all Florists greatly desire to bee
acquainted, as well for the beauty of his double flowers, as also for his superabounding
sweete smell, one stalke with flowers being instead of a nosegay) hath many very
broad, and very long leaues, somewhat greener then gray, among which riseth vp a
strong round stalke, being sometimes almost flat, and ribbed, bearing foure or fiue, or
more white flowers at the toppe, euery one being very great, large, and double, the
leaues being confusedly set together, hauing little peeces of a yellow cup running among
them, without any shew of that purple ring that is in the former, and fall away
without bearing seed, euen as all, or most other double flowers doe: the smell
is so exceeding sweet and strong, that it will soone offend the senses of any, that
shall smell much vnto it: the roote is great and thicke, couered with a blackish
coate.</p>

<p>This Daffodill differeth very little or nothing in leafe from the former, the onely
difference is in the flowers, which although they bee double, and beare many vpon a
stalke, like vnto them, yet this hath the peeces of the yellow cuppes tipt with purple,
as if they were shred or scattered among the white leaues, whereas the other hath only
the yellow, without any shew of purple tips vpon them: the smell of this is as strong
as of the other.</p>

<p>The first of these Daffodils, was full brought into England by <abbr title="Mister">Mʳ.</abbr> Iohn

Some of the double white kindes grow in Candy, and about Aleppo also.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Time.</h5>

<p>The Turkie kindes doe for the most part all flower early, in the end of

the middle or end of April.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Names.</h5>

<p>All these Daffodils, except the first, haue had diuers Turkish names set
vpon the packets, wherein they haue been sent, but there is small regard of
certainty to be expected from them; for that the name <i>Serincade</i>, without
any more addition, which is a single Daffodill, hath beene imposed vpon
that parcell of rootes, that have borne most of them double flowers of diuers
sorts; and the name <i>Serincade Catamer lale</i> which signifieth a double
flowered Daffodill, hath had many single white flowers, with yellow cups,
and some whose flowers have been wholly white, cuppe and all, and some
purple ringed, and double also among them. Their names, whereby they
are knowne and called with vs, are, as fitly as may be, imposed in their titles:
And this I hope shall suffice, to have spoken of these sorts of Daffodils.</p>

<p>Hauing finished the discourse of the former sort of broad leafed Daffodils, it is fit to
proceede to the next, which are <i>Angustifolios Narcissos</i>, those Daffodils that have
narrow leaures, and first to set down those that beare single flowers, whether one or

<p>This plant I thought fittest to place here in the beginning of this <i>Classis</i>, not finding
where better to shroud it. It hath two or three long, and very narrow leaues, as greene
as the leaues of the great <i>Leucoium bulbosum</i>, and shining withall, which grow sometimes
reddish, especially at the edges: the stalke riseth vp a spanne high, bearing one
flower and no more on the head thereof, standing vpright like a little Lilly or Tulipa,
made of six leaues, wholly white, both within and without, except that at the bottome
next to the stalke, and a little on the backside of the three outer leaues, it hath a small
dash or shew of a reddish purple colour: it hath in the middle a few chiues, standing
about a small head pointed; which head groweth to bee small and long, containing
small blackish flat seede: the roote is small, long, and round, a little blackish on the

one flower, not altogether so great as the late flowring Daffodill, with a long cuppe,
described before among the broad leafed ones, which consisteth of six pale coloured
leaves, not pure white, but hauing a wash of light yellow among the white: the cuppe

<p>This Autumne Daffodill hath two or three leaues at the most, and very narrow, so

and more pointed at the toppe, betweene these leaues commeth vp the stalke,

bearing at the head two or three flowers a peece, each of them being small and yellow,

Florence, who first sent this plant to Christian Porret at Leyden, after the death of Carolus
Clusius, writeth that euery stalke doth beare with him more store of flowers,

it in the end of these narrow leafed Daffodils, as being indifferent, whether it

like vnto the other Rush Daffodils, but thicker and broader, so that it may without
any great errour, bee reckoned among these narrow leafed Daffodils, bearing at
the toppe two or three very faire large flowers, with a large and more open cuppe,
then in any other of the Rush Daffodils, both of them of a faire yellow colour, yet
the cuppe a little deeper then the flower, and a little crumpled about the edges, and

<p>The first that hath made mention of this Daffodill, was Matthiolus, who
placed it in the third place among his Daffodils, and is most vsually now adayes
called <i>Narcissus tertius Matthioli</i>, Matthiolus his third Daffodill,
the rather, because Clusius vpon a more mature deliberation, first referred
it thereunto, but called it at the first, <i>Lilionarcissus Hemerocallidis facie</i>, and,
as hee saith, Iacobus Plateau (who first sent him the figure hereof, with the
description) called it <i>Lilionarcissus Orientalis</i>, but Clusius vpon certaine information,
that it grew in the places aforesaid, misliked the name of <i>Orientalis</i>,
and added <i>Hemerocallis</i>, which yet is not fit, for that his <i>Hemerocallis
Valentina</i>, is a plaine Pancration or Sea bastard Daffodill, whose middle
cup is longer then the cup of any true Daffodill, which (as I said in the <a href="#Chap_2_IX" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 9">beginning
of this Chapter</a>) is the chiefest note of difference, betweene a true
and a bastard Daffodill. I receiued the seede of this Daffodill among many
other seedes of rare plants, from the liberality of <abbr title="Mister">Mʳ.</abbr> Doctor Flud, one of
the Physitians of the Colledge in London, who gathered them in the Vniuersity
Garden at Pisa in Italy, and brought them with him, returning home

beare a flower, which the first yeare that it did flower, bore foure stalkes of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>flowers, with euery one of them eight or ten flowers on them) which of all
other names, doth least answer the forme or qualities of this plant. It may
most fitly be called <i>Narcissus marinus maximus</i>, in English, The great Sea
Daffodill, both because it is a true Daffodill, and the greatest of all other,
and also because it hath not been found, but in Islands, or else in other places
neare the Sea. Lobelius entituleth it <i>Pancratium Indicum alterum vernum,
siue Narcissus Indicus alter facie Pancratij Monspeliaci</i>, but all this is wide from
the matter, as may easily be known, by that that hath been said before. It is
generally (as I said before) called of all <i>Narcissus tertius Matthioli</i>, Matthiolus
his third Daffodill, which may either so passe with vs, or as I called it,
The great Sea Daffodill, which you will, &amp; so Clusius doth lastly entitle it.</p>

eight or ten in number, euery one by it selfe vpon a small footstalke, made of six leaues

the stalke is spotted with diuers discoloured spots, and is bare or naked from these two

desiring to be deepe in the ground; and therefore will runne downe, where it
will then encrease into many of-sets, from whence rise vp many thicke, long, and stiffe

<p>There is much variety in this kinde of bastard Daffodill: For one sort hath verie

that breadth: the flower is wholly yellow, but a little paler then the former Spanish
kinde, hauing the leaues of his flower long, and somewhat narrow, standing like wings
about the middle trunke, which is as long as the leaues, and smaller then in many other
of this kinde, but a little yellower then the wings. Another sort hath narrower green
leaues then this last, and longer, the flower is all yellow, but the trunke is larger, wider,
and more open at the mouth then the former, and almost as large as the former Spanish,
but not so high as the last. A third hath the wings of the flower of a Strawe colour,
but the trunke is long and narrow, of a faire yellow. A fourth hath such like
flowers, but that it is shorter, both the wings and the trunke: Some likewise haue the
wings of the flower longer, then the long trunke, and some shorter. Some also are all
yellow, and some haue their wings onely a little more pale or white, like the English
kinde: Some againe haue their trunkes long and narrow, others haue them larger and
wider open, and crumpled at the brimmes; so that it is needlesse, to spend a great deale

<p>The leaues of this Daffodill are of a meane size, betweene the broadest and the narrower

high or more, whereon standeth one large great flower, equalling the greatest Spanish
bastard Daffodill, before described, in the largenesse of his trunke, and hauing the
brimmes turned vp a little, which maketh it seeme the larger: the wings or outer leaues
are in a manner as short, as they are in the greatest Spanish kinde, (and not long flagging
down, like vnto the Mountain kinds) and stand straight outright: all the whole flower is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of one euen colour, that is, of a fine pale yellow, somewhat like vnto the colour of a
Lemon peele or rinde, but somewhat whiter, which vsually we call a Strawe colour;

like vnto the first Spanish kinde, but a little broader, and of a whiter greene colour,
yet not so white, as in the lesser Spanish white kindes, hereafter described: among
these leaues riseth vp a round strong stalke, about two foote high, bearing one white
flower at the toppe, bending downe the head, as all these white kindes doe, but is not
of so pure a white, as the lesser kindes that follow, yet whiter then the greatest white
Spanish kinde, next of all to be described: the whole flower, as well trunke as wings,
is much larger then the lesser white kindes, and almost equalling the first Spanish yellow,
but a little longer and narrower, a little crumpled and turning vp at the brimmes:
the head and seede are like the first; the roote is greater and thicker then the first Spanish,

some shew of palenesse therein, and more vpon the first opening of the flower then afterwards,

of a whitish greene colour, one a little broader then the other: the flowers of both are
pure white, and bending downe the heads, that they almost touch the stalke againe,
the greater flower hath the longer and narrower trunke; and the lesser flower, the
shorter and wider open, yet both a little crumpled at the edges or brimmes: the rootes

<p>This bastard Daffodill is so common in all England, both in Copses, Woods, and
Orchards, that I might well forbeare the description thereof, and especially, in that
growing wilde, it is of little respect in our Garden: but yet, lest I bee challenged of
ignorance in common plants, and in regard of some variety therein worth the marking.
I will set downe his description and variety as briefly as I may: It hath three or
foure grayish greene leaues, long and somewhat narrow, among which riseth vp the
stalke, about a span high or little higher, bearing at the toppe, out of a skinnie huske,
as all other Daffodils haue, one flower (although sometimes I haue seene two together)
somewhat large, hauing the six leaues that stand like wings, of a pale yellow colour,
and the long trunke in the middle of a faire yellow, with the edges or brimmes
a little crumpled or vneuen: after the flower is past, it beareth a round head, seeming
three square, containing round blacke seede; the roote is somewhat blackish on the
outside.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<p>But there is another of this kinde like vnto the former, whose further description
you haue here before; the wings of which flower are much more white then the former,
and in a manner of a milke white colour, the trunke remaining almost as yellow
as the former, and not differing in any thing else.</p>

double Daffodill, which since hath so continued.</p>

<p>The third is of mine owne fostering or raising, as I said before; for assuredly,
it is risen from the seede of the great Spanish single kinde, which I
sowed in mine owne Garden, and cherished it, vntill it gaue such a flower
as is described.</p>

<p>The fourth is not certainly knowne where his originall should be: Some
thinke it to be of France, and others of Germany.</p>

<p>The last is assuredly first naturall of our owne Countrey, for <abbr title="Mister">Mʳ.</abbr> Gerrard
first discouered it to the world, finding it in a poore womans Garden in the
West parts of England, where it grew before the woman came to dwell
there, and, as I haue heard since, is naturall of the Isle of Wight.</p>

in their titles: and for the English names, if you please, you may let
them passe likewise as they are expressed there also, that thereby euery one
may be truely distinguished, and not confounded. The fourth, besides the
name in the title, is called of some <i>Narcissus Germanicus</i>, which whether it
be of Germany, or no, I know not; but that the name should import so much.
The last doth vsually carry <abbr title="Mister">Mʳ.</abbr> Gerrards name, and called Gerrards double

longer, larger, and wider open at the mouth, cut in or indented at the brims or edges,

<p>Diuers doe call it <i>Pancratium</i>, as the learned of Mompeher, and others,
with the addition of <i>flore Lilij</i>, after they had left their old errour, in taking
it to be <i>Scylla</i>, and vsing it for <i>Scylla</i>, in the <i>Trochisces</i> that go into Andromachus
Treakle. The learned of Valentia in Spaine, as Clusius saith, doe call
it <i>Hemerocallis</i>, thinking it to be a Lilly; and Clusius doth thereupon call it,
<i>Hemerocallis Valentina</i>: but in my opinion, all these are deceiued in this
plant; for it is neither a Lilly, to haue the name of <i>Hemerocallis</i> giuen vnto
it, nor <i>Scylla</i>, nor <i>Pancratium</i>, as many doe yet call it: for certainly this is a
kinde of Daffodill; the forme both of roote, leafe, and flower, doth assure
me that haue seene it, and not <i>Pancratium</i>, which (as Dioscorides testifieth)
is a kinde of <i>Scylla</i>, and in his time called <i>Scylla</i>, with a red roote, and a leafe
like a Lilly, but longer, and was vsed both with the same preparation and
quantity, and for the same diseases that <i>Scylla</i> was vsed, but that his force
was weaker: all which doth plainly shew the errours that many learned men
haue been conuersant in, and that all may see how necessary the knowledge
of Herbarisme is to the practice of Physicke; And lest the roote of this Sea
bastard Daffodill bee vsed in the stead of an wholesome remedy, which (as
Clusius maketh mention) was deadly to him that did but cut his meate with
that knife, which had immediately before cut this roote, and done in malice
by him, that knew the force thereof, to kill his fellow, it working the more
forceably by the euill attracting quality of the iron.</p>

heads of this roote arise diuers strong and very tall stalkes, beset with diuers faire,
long, and broad leaues, ioyned at the bottome close vnto the stalke, where they are
greatest, and grow smaller to the very end, and those that grow higher to the toppe,
being smaller and smaller, which being broken, there appeare many threeds like wooll
in them: the toppes of the stalkes are garnished with many faire large white flowers,
each whereof is composed of six leaues, lying spread open, as the flowers of the white

are set at certaine distances many short leaues, being broad at the bottome, where
they doe almost compasse the stalke, and are smaller toward the end where it is sharpe
pointed: at the top of the stalke stand many flowers, with a small peece of a green leafe

of a faire yellow colour, flowring first below, and so vpwards by degrees, euery one of
these flowers is made like vnto a little pitcher or bottle, being bigge in the belly, and

The third is called of some onely <i>Hyacinthus maior</i> and of others <i>Hyacinthus
comosus maior</i>: We call it in English, The purple faire haired Iacinth,
because of his tuft of purple threeds, like haires at the toppe, and (as I said)
of diuers Gentlewomen, purple tassels. The fourth is called by some as it
is in the title, <i>Hyacinthus Comosus ramosus</i>, and of others <i>Hyacinthus Calamistratus</i>.
And the last or fifth is diuersly called by diuers, Fabius Columna in
his <i>Phytobasanos</i> the second part, calleth it <i>Hyacinthus Sannesius</i>, because hee
first saw it in that Cardinals Garden at Rome. Robin of Paris sent to vs the
former of the two last, by the name of <i>Hyacinthus Pennatus</i>, and <i>Hyacinthus
Calamistratus</i>, when as others sent the last by the name <i>Pennatus</i>, and the other
by the name of <i>Calamistratus</i>; but I thinke the name <i>Cincinnatus</i> is more
fit and proper for it, in that the curled threeds which seeme like haires, are
better expressed by the word <i>Cincinnus</i>, then <i>Calamistrum</i>, this signifying
but the bodkin or instrument wherewith they vse to frisle or curle the haire,
and that the bush of haire it selfe being curled. Some also haue giuen to both
these last the names of <i>Hyacinthus Comosus Parnassi</i>, the one fairer then the
other. Of all these names you may vse which you please; but for the last
kinde, the name <i>Cincinnatus</i>, as I said, is the more proper, but <i>Pennatus</i> is
the more common, and <i>Calamistratus</i> for the former of the two last.</p>

leaues, and turne back the ends a little again: the other three which are innermost, do
as it were close together in the middle of the flower, without laying themselues open
at all, being a little whitish at the edges: the whole flower is of a purplish yellow colour,
with some white and green as it were mixed among it, of no sent at all: it beareth
blacke and flat seede in three square, great, and bunched out heads: the roote is reasonable
great, and white on the outside, with many strong white fibres at it, which perish
not yearely, as the fibres of many other Iacinths doe, and as it springeth late, so it
holdeth his greene leaues almost vntill Winter.</p>

<p>There was another also brought from the Cape of good Hope, whose leaues were
stronger and greener then the former, the stalke also thicker, bearing diuers flowers,
confusedly standing vpon longer foote-stalkes, yet made after the same fashion, but
that the three inner leaues were whitish, and dented about the edges, otherwise the

paler blew, or of a bleake blew, tending to an ash colour: Some are pure white, and
some are party coloured, blew and white; and some are of a fine delayed purplish red

were made of the woolly substance of a bulbous roote, that was taken
from between the core or heart of the roote (which, as he saith, was

very like to a Cone or Pineapple, and begin to flower belowe, and so vpwards
by degrees, euery flower standing vpon a long blackish blew foote-stalke, which when

<p>This Starry Iacinth (being longest knowne, and therefore most common) riseth out
of the ground, vsually but with two browne leaues, yet sometimes with three, inclosing
within them the stalke of flowers, the buds appearing of a darke whitish colour,
as soone as the leaues open themselues, which leaues being growne, are long, and hollow,
of a whitish greene on the vpper side, and browne on the vnder side, and
halfe round, the browne stalke rising vp higher, beareth fiue or sixe small starre-like
flowers thereon, consisting of six leaues, of a faire deepe blew, tending to a purple.
The seede is yellowish, and round, contained in round pointed heads, which by reason
of their heauinesse, and the weaknesse of the stalke, lye vpon the ground, and often
perish with wet and frosts, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> The roote is somewhat long, and couered with a yellowish
coate.</p>

<p>The white Starry Iacinth hath his leaues like the former, but greene and fresh, not
browne, and a little narrower also: the buddes for flowers at the first appeare a little
blush, which when they are blowne, are white, but yet retaine in them a small shew of
that blush colour.</p>

<p>This Iacinth hath his leaues a little broader, of a fresher greene, and not browne at
all, as the first blew Iacinth of Fuchsius last remembred: the buds of the flowers, while
they are enclosed within the leaues, and after, when the stalke is growne vp, doe remaine
more blew then the buds of the former: the flowers, when they are blowne open,
are like the former, but somewhat larger, and of a more liuely blew colour: the

<p>This blush coloured Iacinth is very rare, but very pleasant, his flowers being as large
as the first of this last kinde, and somewhat larger then the blush of the other kinde:
the leaues and rootes differ not from the last recited Iacinth.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Place.</h5>

<p>All these Iacinths haue beene found in the Woods and Mountaines of
Germany, Bohemia, and Austria, as Fuchsius and Gesner doe report, and in
Naples, as Imperatus and others doe testifie. Wee cherish them all with
great care in our Gardens, but especially the white and the blush of both
kindes, for that they are more tender, and often perish for want of due regard.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Time.</h5>

<p>The common kindes, which are first expressed, flower about the middle
of February, if the weather bee milde, and the other kindes sometimes a
fortnight after, that is, in March, but ordinarily much about the same time
with the former.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Names.</h5>

<p>The first is called in Latine <i>Hyacinthus Stellatus vulgaris</i>, and <i>Hyacinthus
Stellatus bifolius</i>, and <i>Hyacinthus Stellaris Fuchsij</i> and of some <i>Hyacinthus
Stellatus Germanicus</i>; wee might very well call the other kinde, <i>Hyacinthus
Stellatus vulgaris alter</i>, but diuers call it <i>Præcox</i>, and some <i>Martius</i>, as it is in
the title. In English they may bee seuerally called: the first, The common;
and the other, The early Starry Iacinth (notwithstanding the first flowreth
before the other) for distinction sake.</p>

<p>The <i>Hyacinthus</i>, seemeth to be called <i>Vacinium</i> of Virgil in his Eclogues;
for hee alwayes reckoneth it among the flowers that were vsed to decke
Garlands, and neuer among fruits, as some would haue it. But in that hee
calleth it <i>Vacinium nigrum</i>, in seuerall places, that doth very fitly answer the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
common receiued custome of those times, that called all deepe blew colours,
such as are purples, and the like, blacke; for the Violet it selfe is likewise
called blacke in the same place, where he calleth the <i>Vacinium</i> blacke;
so that it seemeth thereby, that he reckoned them to be both of one colour,
and we know the colour of the Violet is not blacke, as we doe distinguish of
blacke in these dayes. But the colour of this Starry Iacinth, being both of
so deepe a purple sometimes, so neare vnto a Violet colour, and also more
frequent, then any other Iacinth with them, in those places where Virgil
liued, perswadeth me to thinke, that Virgil vnderstood this Starry Iacinth
by <i>Vacinium</i>: Let others iudge otherwise, if they can shew greater probabilitie.</p>

beset with six blew chiues or threeds, tipt with blacke, so closly compassing the

these plants can bee no Iacinths, because their flowers appeare before their
leaues in Autumne, contrary to the true Iacinth, as he saith: and therefore he
would faine haue it referred to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Theophrastus bulbus in libro primo <abbr title="capitulum">cap.</abbr> 12.</cite></i> and
calleth it his <i>Tiphyum</i> mentioned in that place, as also <i>Bulbus astivus Dalechampij</i>.

<p>The Squill or Sea Onion (as many doe call it) hath diuers thicke leaues, broad, long,

did sell them to mee and others for our vse) lying vpon the ground, somewhat like
vnto the leaues of a Lilly: these spring vp after the flowers are past, and the seed ripe,
they abiding all the Winter, and the next Spring, vntill the heate of the Summer hath
spent and consumed them, and then about the end of August, or beginning of September,
the stalke with flowers ariseth out of the ground a foote and a halfe high, bearing
many starre-like flowers on the toppe, in a long spike one aboue another, flowring by
degrees, the lowest first, and so vpwards, whereby it is long in flowring, very like, as
well in forme as bignesse, to the flowers of the great Starre of Bethlehem (these flowers
I haue likewise seene shooting out of some of the rootes, that haue been brought in
the like manner:) after the flowers are past, there come vp in their places thicke and
three square heads, wherin is contained such like flat, black, and round seed, as the Spanish
duskie Iacinth before described did beare, but greater: the root is great &amp; white,
couered with many peelings or couerings, as is plainly enough seen to any that know

places: it will not abide in any Garden farre from the Sea, no not in Italy,
as it is related.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Time.</h5>

<p>The time wherein they flower, is expressed to be in August and September:
this seede to be ripe in October and Nouember, and the greene leaues
to spring vp in Nouember and December.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Names.</h5>

<p>These are certainly the true kindes of <i>Scilla</i> that should bee vsed in medicines,
although (as Clusius reporteth) the Spaniards forbade him to taste of
the red Squill, as of a most strong and present poison. Pliny hath made
more sorts then can be found out yet to this day with vs: that <i>Scilla</i> that is
called <i>Epimenidia</i>, because it might be eaten, is thought to be the great <i>Ornithogalum</i>,
or Starre of Bethlehem. <i>Pancratium</i> is, I know, and as I said before,
referred to that kinde of bastard Sea Daffodill, which is set forth before
in the end of the history of the bastard Daffodils; and diuers also
would make the <i>Narcissus tertius Matthioli</i>, which I call the true Sea Daffodill,
to be a <i>Pancratium</i>; but seeing Dioscorides (and no other is against him)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
maketh <i>Pancratium</i> to be a kinde of Squill with reddish rootes, I dare not
vphold their opinion against such manifest truth.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Vertues.</h5>

<p>The Squill or Sea Onion is wholly vsed physically with vs, because wee
can receiue no pleasure from the sight of the flowers. Pliny writeth, that
Pithagoras wrote a volume or booke of the properties thereof, for the singular
effects it wrought; which booke is lost, yet the diuers vertues it hath is
recorded by others, to be effectual for the spleene, lungs, stomach, liuer,
head and heart; and for dropsies, old coughs, Iaundise, and the wormes;
that it cleareth the sight, helpeth the tooth-ache, cleanseth the head of
scurfe, and running sores; and is an especiall Antidote against poison: and
therefore is vsed as a principall ingredient into the <i>Theriaca Andromachi</i>,
which we vsually call Venice Treakle. The Apothecaries prepare hereof,
both Wine, Vinegar, and Oxymel or Syrupe, which is singular to extenuate
and expectorate tough flegme, which is the cause of much disquiet in the
body, and an hinderer of concoction, or digestion in the stomach, besides
diuers other wayes, wherein the scales of the rootes, being dryed, are vsed.
And Galen hath sufficiently explained the qualities and properties thereof,
in his <cite>eight Booke of Simples</cite>.</p>

  <span class="line">The great Starre-flower of Arabia.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Arabian Starre-flower hath many broad, and long greene leaues, very like vnto
the leaues of the Orientall Iacinth, but lying for the most part vpon the ground,
among which riseth vp a round greene stalke, almost two foote high, bearing at the
toppe diuers large flowers, standing vpon long foote-stalkes, and at the bottome of
euery one of them a small short pointed greene leafe: these flowers are made of six
pure white leaues a peece, laid open as large as an ordinary Daffodill, but of the forme
of a Starre Iacinth, or Starre of Bethlehem, which close as they doe euery night, and
open themselues in the day time, especially in the Sunne, the smell whereof is pretty
sweete, but weake: in the middle of the flower is a blackish head, compassed with six
white threeds, tipt with yellow pendents: the seede hath not beene obserued with vs:
the roote is great and white, with a flat bottome, very impatient of our cold Winters,
so that it seldome prospereth or abideth with vs; for although sometimes it doe abide
a Winter in the ground, yet it often lyeth without springing blade, or any thing else a
whole yeare, and then perisheth: or if it doe spring, yet many doe not beare, and most
after their first bearing doe decay and perish. But if any be desirous, to know how to
preserue the roote of this plant, or of many other bulbous rootes that are tender, such
as the great double white Daffodill of Constantinople, and other fine Daffodils, that
come from hot Countries; let them keepe this rule: Let either the roote be planted in
a large pot, or tubbe of earth, and housed all the Winter, that so it may bee defended
from the frosts; Or else (which is the easier way) keepe the roote out of the ground
euery yeare, from September, after the leaues and stalkes are past, vntill February, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
some dry, but not hot or windy place, and then plant it in the ground vnder a South
wall, or such like defended place, which will spring, and no doubt prosper well
there, in regard the greatest and deepest frosts are past after February, so that seldome
any great frosts come after, to pierce so deepe as the roote is to be set, or thereby to
doe any great harme to it in such a place.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Place.</h5>

<p>This hath been often sent out of Turkie, and likewise out of Italy; I had
likewise two rootes sent mee out of Spaine by Guillaume Boel before remembred,
which (as hee said) hee gathered there, but they prospered not
with me, for want of the knowledge of the former rule. It may be likely that
Arabia is the place, from whence they of Constantinople receiue it.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Time.</h5>

<p>It flowreth in May, if it be of the first yeares bringing; or in Iune, if it

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Names.</h5>

<p>It hath been sent out of Italy by the name of <i>Lilium Alexandrinum</i>, The
Lilly of Alexandria, but it hath no affinity with any Lilly. Others call it
<i>Hyacinthus Arabicus</i>; and the Italians, <i>Iacintho del pater nostro</i>; but it is no Iacinth
neither, although the flowers be like some of them. Some also would
referre it to a <i>Narcissus</i> or Daffodill, and it doth as little agree with it, as
with a Lilly, although his flowers in largenesse and whitenesse resemble a
Daffodill. Clusius hath most fitly referred it to the stocke or kindred of
<i>Ornithogala</i>, or Starres of Bethlehem, as wee call them in English, and
from the Turkish name, <i>Zumbul Arabi</i>, entituled it <i>Ornithogalum Arabicum</i>,
although <i>Zumbul</i>, as I haue before declared, is with them, a Iacinth, wee
may call it in English, The Arabian Starre-flower, or Starre of Bethlehem,

Iacinth, which doe abide greene, from the beginning or middle of Ianuary, or
before sometimes, vntill the end of May, at which time they begin to fade, and the
stalke with the head of flowers beginneth to rise, so that it will haue either few or no
leaues at all, when the flowers are blowne: the stalke is strong, round, and firme, rising
two foote high or more, bearing at the toppe a great bush of flowers, seeming at the first
to be a great greene eare of corne, for it is made spike-fashion, which when the flowers
are blowne, doth rise to be very high, slender or small at the head aboue, and broad
spread and bushing below, so that it is long in flowring; for they flower below first,
and so vpwards by degrees: these flowers are snow white, without any line on the
backside, and is therein like vnto the former, as also in whitenesse, but nothing so
large, with a white vmbone or head in the middle, beset with many white threeds,
tipt with yellow: the seede is blacke and round, contained in three square heads: the

farre spread at the bottome as it, the flowers also are not so white, and each of the
leaues of them haue a greene line downe the backe, leauing the edges on both sides
white: after the flowers are past, the heads for seede grow three square, like the other,

<p>This Hungarian Starre-flower shooteth out diuers narrow, long, whitish greene

Gilloflowers, and so abide aboue the ground, hauing a stalke rising in the middle of them

<p>Diuers haue referred this plant vnto the Asphodils, because (as I thinke) the flowers
hereof are straked on the backe, and the leaues long and narrow, like vnto the Asphodils;
but the roote of this being bulbous, I rather (as some others doe) ioyne it with

smaller, and growing more sparsedly about the stalke vpon short foot-stalkes, but in a
reasonable long head spike-fashion: the seede is like vnto the second kinde, but smaller:
the roote is somewhat yellowish, like the first great white kinde.</p>

<p>The first is onely nursed in Gardens, his originall being not well
knowne, yet some attribute it vnto <i>Pannonia</i> or Hungary. The second hath
been found neare vnto Barcinone, and Toledo in Spaine. The third was
found in Hungary by Clusius. Our ordinary euery where in the fields of
Italy and France, and (as it is said) in England also. And the last groweth
likewise by the corne fields in the vpper Hungary.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Time.</h5>

<p>They flower in Aprill and May, and sometimes in Iune.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Names.</h5>

<p>The first is called by Clusius <i>Ornithogalum maximum album</i>, because it is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>greater then the next, which hee tooke formerly for the greatest: but it
might more fitly, in my iudgement, bee called <i>Asphodelus bulbosus albus</i> (if
there be any <i>Asphodelus bulbosus</i> at all) because this do so nearly resemble
that, both in the early springing, and the decay of the greene leaues, when
the stalkes of flowers doe rise vp. Diuers also doe call it <i>Ornithogalum Pannonicum
maximum album</i>.</p>

<p>The second hath his name in his title, as most authors doe set it downe,
yet in <cite>the great Herball referred to Dalechampius</cite>, it is called <i>Ornithogalum
magnum Myconi</i>.</p>

<p>The third hath his name from the place of his birth, and the other from
his popularity, yet Dodonæus calleth it <i>Bulbus Leucanthemos</i>.</p>

<p>The last is called by diuers <i>Asphodelo-hyacinthinus</i>, and <i>Hyacintho-asphodelus
Galeni</i>. Dodonæus calleth it <i>Asphodelus fæmina</i>, and <i>Asphodelus bulbosus</i>.
But Lobel, and Gerrard from him, and Dodonæus, doe make this to
haue white flowers, whereas all that I haue seene, both in mine owne, and in
others Gardens, bore greenish flowers, as Clusius setteth it truely downe.
Lobel seemeth in the description of this, to confound the <i>Ornithogalum</i> of
Mompelier with it, and calleth it <i>Asphodelus hyacinthinus forte Galeni</i>, and
saith that some would call it <i>Pancratium Monspeliense</i>, and <i>Asphodelus Galeni</i>.
But as I haue shewed, the <i>Ornithogalum spicatum</i> and this, doe plainly differ
the one from the other, and are not both to be called by one name, nor to
be reckoned one, but two distinct plants.</p>

euery one standing in a little cuppe or huske, which is diuided into three or foure
parts, hanging downe very long about the heads for seede: after the flower is past,
these flowers doe all hang downe their heads, and open one way, although their little

six long leaues, of a pure white on the inside, and of a blewish or whitish greene colour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
on the outside, leauing the edges of euery leafe white on both sides: in the middle of

great round heads, which are too heauie for the stalke to beare; and therefore lye

it forth in the fourth place, whereupon many doe call it <i>Narcissus quartus
Matthioli</i>, The fourth Daffodill of Matthiolus. Fabius Columna calleth
it <i>Hyacinthus aruorum Ornithogali flore</i>. Clusius (to whom Imperatus sent it,

standing vpon equall foot-stalkes, or not one much higher then another, consisting of
fiue leaues a peece, striped downe the backe with a small pale line, hauing a round

wrapped in white close huskes: the roote groweth very great, sometimes bigger then

  <span class="line">The small yellow Asphodill, or Kings speare.</span>
</h5>

<p>This small yellow Asphodill, which is vsually called the Kings speare, hath many
long narrow edged leaues, which make them seeme three square, of a bluish or whitish
greene colour: the stalke riseth vp three foote high oftentimes, beset with small
long leaues vp vnto the very flowers, which grow thicke together spike-fashion one
aboue another, for a great length, and wholly yellow, laid open like a Starre, somewhat
greater then the last white Asphodill, and smaller then the first, which when
they are past yeeld round heads, containing blacke cornered seede, almost three
square: the rootes are many long yellow strings, which spreading in the ground, doe
much encrease.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Place.</h5>

<p>All these Asphodils doe grow naturally in Spaine and France, and from
thence were first brought vnto vs, to furnish our Gardens.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Time.</h5>

<p>All the glandulous rooted Asphodils doe flower some in May, and some
in Iune; but the two last doe flower, the yellow or last, of them in Iuly, and
the former white one in August and September, and vntill the cold and
winter hinder it.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Names.</h5>

<p>Their seuerall names are giuen them in their titles, as much as is fit for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
this discourse. For to shew you that the Greekes doe call the stalke of the
great Asphodill <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ανθερίκη</span>, and the Latines <i>Albucum</i>, or what else belongeth
to them, is fitter for another worke, vnto which I leaue them.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="faux nobreak">{Bastard Asphodils}</h4>

<p>The bastard Asphodils should follow next in place, if this worke were fit for them;
but because I haue tyed my selfe to expresse onely those flowers and plants, that for
their beauty, or sent, or both, doe furnish a Garden of Pleasure, and they haue none, I
leaue them to a generall History of plants, or that Garden of Simples before spoken of,
and will describe the Lilly Asphodils, and the <i>Phalangia</i> or Spider-worts, which are
remaining of those, that ioyne in name or fashion, and are to be here inserted, before I
passe to the rest of the bulbous rootes.</p>

<h4 class="faux nobreak">{Day Lillies}</h4>

<h5 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liliasphodelus phœniceus.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The gold red Day Lilly.</span>
</h5>

<p>Because the rootes of this and the next, doe so nearely agree with the two last recited
Asphodils, I haue set them in this place, although some doe place them next after
the Lillies, because their flowers doe come nearest in forme vnto Lillies; but whether
you will call them Asphodils with Lilly flowers, as I thinke it fittest, or Lillies with
Asphodill rootes, or Lillies without bulbous rootes, as others doe, I will not contend.</p>

<p>The red Day Lilly hath diuers broad and long fresh greene leaues, folded at the
first as it were double, which after open, and remaine a little hollow in the middle;
among which riseth vp a naked stalke three foot high, bearing at the toppe many flowers,
one not much distant from another, and flowring one after another, not hauing
lightly aboue one flower blown open in a day, &amp; that but for a day, not lasting longer,
but closing at night, and not opening againe; whereupon it had his English name, The
Lilly for a day: these flowers are almost as large as the flowers of the white Lilly, and
made after the same fashion, but of a faire gold red, or Orange tawny colour. I could
neuer obserue any seede to follow these flowers; for they seeme the next day after they
haue flowred, (except the time be faire and dry) to bee so rotten, as if they had lyen in
wet to rotte them, whereby I thinke no seede can follow: the rootes are many thicke
and long yellow knobbed strings, like vnto the small yellow Asphodill rootes, but
somewhat greater, running vnder ground in like sort, and shooting young heads round
about.</p>

<h5 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liliasphodelus luteus.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The yellow Day Lilly.</span>
</h5>

<p>I shall not neede to make a repetition of the description of this Day Lilly, hauing
giuen you one so amply before, because this doth agree thereunto so nearely, as that
it might seeme the same; these differences onely it hath, the leaues are not fully so
large, nor the flower so great or spread open, and the colour thereof is of a faire yellow
wholly, and very sweet, which abideth blowne many daies before it fade, and hath
giuen blacke round seede, growing in round heads, like the heads of the small yellow
Asphodill, but not so great.</p>

<p>Clusius hath set downe, that it was reported, that there should be another Liliasphodill
with a white flower, but we can heare of none such as yet; but I rather thinke, that
they that gaue that report might be mistaken, in thinking the Sauoye Spider-wort to
be a white Liliasphodill, which indeede is so like, that one not well experienced, or
not well regarding it, may soone take one for another.</p>

<p>This Spider-wort is of late knowledge, and for it the Christian world is indebted

(sometimes belonging to the right Honourable Lord Robert Earle of Salisbury,
Lord Treasurer of England in his time, and then vnto the right Honourable the Lord

first receiued it of a friend, that brought it out of Virginia, thinking it to bee the Silke
Grasse that groweth there, and hath imparted hereof, as of many other things, both to
me and others; the description whereof is as followeth:</p>

<p>From a stringie roote, creeping farre vnder ground, and rising vp againe in many
places, springeth vp diuers heads of long folded leaues, of a grayish ouer-worne
greene colour, two or three for the most part together, and not aboue, compassing one
another at the bottome, and abiding greene in many places all the Winter; other-where
perishing, and rising anew in the Spring, which leaues rise vp with the great
round stalke, being set thereon at the ioynts, vsually but one at a ioynt, broad at the
bottome where they compasse the stalke, and smaller and smaller to the end: at the
vpper ioynt, which is the toppe of the stalke, there stand two or three such like leaues,
but smaller, from among which breaketh out a dozen, sixteene, or twenty, or more
round green heads, hanging downe their heads by little foot-stalkes, which when the
flower beginneth to blow open, groweth longer, and standeth vpright, hauing three
small pale greene leaues for a huske, and three other leaues within them for the flower,
which lay themselues open flat, of a deepe blew purple colour, hauing an vmbone or
small head in the middle, closely set about with six reddish, hairy, or feathered threeds,
tipt with yellow pendents: this flower openeth it selfe in the day, &amp; shutteth vsually at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
night, and neuer openeth againe, but perisheth, and then hangeth downe his head againe;
the greene huske of three leaues, closing it selfe againe into the forme of a head,
but greater, as it was before, the middle vmbone growing to bee the seede vessell,
wherein is contained small, blackish, long seede: Seldome shall any man see aboue
one, or two at the most of these flowers blowne open at one time vpon the stalke,
whereby it standeth in flowring a long time, before all the heads haue giuen out their

<p>It is common to all the Medowe Saffrons, except that of the Spring, and one other,
to beare their flowers alone in Autumne or later, without any green leaues with them,
and afterwards in February, their greene leaues: So that I shall not neede to make manie
descriptions, but to shew you the differences that consist in the leaues, and colours
of the flowers; and briefly to passe (after I haue giuen you a full description of the
first) from one vnto another, touching onely those things that are note worthy. The
white English Medowe Saffron then doth beare in Autumne three or foure flowers at
the most, standing seuerally vpon weake foote-stalkes, a fingers length or more aboue
the ground, made of six white leaues, somewhat long and narrow, and not so large as
most of the other kindes, with some threeds or chiues in the middle, like vnto the
Saffron flowers of the Spring, wherein there is no colour of Saffron, or vertue to that
effect: after the flowers are past and gone, the leaues doe not presently follow, but
the roote remaineth in the ground without shew of leafe aboue ground, most part of
the Winter, and then in February there spring vp three or foure large and long greene<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
leaues, when they are fully growne vp, standing on the toppe of a round, weake, green,
and short foote-stalke, somewhat like the leaues of white Lillies, but not so large, and
in the middest of these leaues, after they haue been vp some time, appeare two or three
loose skinny heads, standing in the middle of the leaues vpon short, thicke, greene
stalkes, and being ripe, conteine in them round small brownish seede, that lye as it
were loose therein, and when the head is dry, may bee heard to rattle being shaken:
the roote is white within, but couered with a thicke blackish skinne or coate, hauing
one side thereof at the bottome longer then the other, with an hollownesse also on
the one side of that long eminence, where the flowers rise from the bottome, and
shooting downe from thence a number of white fibres, whereby it is fastened in the
ground: the greene leaues afterwards rising from the top or head of the roote.</p>

<p>There is no difference at all in this Medowe Saffron from the former, but only in the

it is larger both in roote, leafe, and flower, and besides, hath more store of flowers together,
and continuing longer in beauty, without fading so soone as the former, and
are also somewhat of a fairer white colour.</p>

<p>This purple Medowe Saffron is somewhat like vnto the white of this kinde, but that
it beareth not so plentifully as the white, nor doth the roote grow so great; but the
flowers are in a manner as large as they, and of the like pale delayed purple colour, or
somewhat deeper, as is in the purple English, with some veines or markes vpon the
flowers, making some shew of a checker on the out side, but not so conspicuous, as in

<p>This Medowe Saffron of Constantinople hath his leaues so broad and large, that
hardly could any that neuer saw it before, iudge it to be a <i>Colchicum</i>; for they are much
larger then any Lilly leaues, and of a darke greene colour: the flowers are correspondent
to the leaues, larger and more in number then in any of the former purple kindes,
of the same colour with the last purple kinde, but of a little deeper purple on the inside,
with diuers markes running through the flowers, like vnto it, or vnto checkers,
but yet somewhat more apparently: the roote is in the middle greater and rounder
then the others, with a longer eminence, whereby it may easily bee knowne from all
other sorts.</p>

<p>The flowers of this Medowe Saffron are larger and longer then the flowers of either
the English or Hungarian, and almost as large as the last before mentioned, and of the
same colour, but a little deeper, the spots and markes whereof are somewhat more
easie to be seene euen a farre off, like vnto the flower of a Fritillaria, from whence it
tooke his significatiue name: the leaues of this Medowe Saffron doe rise vp sooner
then in any other of the Autumne kindes, for they are alwayes vp before Winter, and
are foure or fiue in number, short rather then long, broad belowe, and pointed at the
end, canaled or hollow, and standing round aboue the ground, one encompassing another
at the bottome, like the great Spanish Starre Iacinth, called the Iacinth of Peru,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
but shorter, and of a pale or grayish greene colour, differing from the colour of all
the other Medowe Saffrons: the roote is like the roote of the English or Hungarian
without any difference, but that it groweth somewhat greater. It is one of the first Medowe
Saffrons that flower in the Autumne.</p>

  <span class="line">The checkerd Medowe Saffron of Naples.</span>
</h4>

<p>This checkerd Medowe Saffron of Naples, is very like vnto the last recited checkerd
Saffron of Portugall, but that the flower is somewhat larger, yet sometimes very
little, or not at all: the greatest marke to distinguish them is, that the flowers of this
are of a deeper colour, and so are the spots on the flowers likewise, which are so conspicuous,
that they are discerned a great way off, more like vnto the flowers of a deepe
Fritillaria, then the former, and make a goodlier and a more glorious shew: the leaues
of this doe rise vp early after the flowers, and are somewhat longer, of a darker greene
colour, yet bending to a grayish colour as the other, not lying so neatly or round, but
stand vp one by another, being as it were folded together: neither of both these last
named checkerd Medowe Saffrons haue giuen any seede in this Countrey, that euer I
could learne or heare of, but are encreased by the roote, which in this is like the former,
but a little bigger.</p>

  <span class="line">8. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colchicum Fritillaricum Chiense.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The checkerd Medowe Saffron of Chio or Sio.</span>
</h4>

<p>This most beautifull Saffron flower riseth vp with his flowers in the Autumne, as
the others before specified doe, although not of so large a size, yet farre more pleasant
and delightfull in the thicke, deepe blew, or purple coloured beautifull spots therein,
which make it excell all others whatsoeuer: the leaues rise vp in the Spring, being
smaller then the former, for the most part three in number, and of a paler or fresher
greene colour, lying close vpon the ground, broad at the bottome, a little pointed at
the end, and twining or folding themselues in and out at the edges, as if they were indented.
I haue not seene any seede it hath borne: the roote is like vnto the others of
this kinde, but small and long, and not so great: it flowreth later for the most part then
any of the other, euen not vntill Nouember, and is very hard to be preserued with vs,
in that for the most part the roote waxeth lesse and lesse euery yeare, our cold Country
being so contrary vnto his naturall, that it will scarce shew his flower; yet when it
flowreth any thing early, that it may haue any comfort of a warme Sunne, it is the
glorie of all these kindes.</p>

  <span class="line">The party coloured Medowe Saffron.</span>
</h4>

<p>The flowers of this Medowe Saffron most vsually doe not appeare, vntill most of
the other Autumne sorts are past, except the last, which are very lowe, scarce rising
with their stalkes three fingers breadth aboue the ground, but oftentimes halfe hid
within the ground: the leaues whereof are smaller, shorter, and rounder, then in any of
the other before specified, some being altogether white, and others wholly of a very
pale purple, or flesh colour; and some againe parted, the one halfe of a leafe white,
and the other halfe of the same purple, and sometimes striped purple and white, in diuers
leaues of one and the same flower: and againe, some will be the most part of the
leafe white, and the bottome purple, thus varying as nature list, that many times from
one roote may bee seene to arise all these varieties before mentioned: these flowers doe
stand long before they fade and passe away; for I haue obserued in my Garden some
that haue kept their flower faire vntill the beginning of Ianuary, vntill the extremitie
of the Winter frosts and snowes haue made them hide their heads: the leaues therefore
accordingly doe rise vp after all other, and are of a brownish or darke greene colour
at their first springing vp, which after grow to be of a deepe greene colour: the
roote is like the former English or Hungarian kindes, but thicker and greater for the
most part, and shorter also.</p>

</h4>

<p>The flowers of this little Medowe Saffron are narrower and smaller then any of the
former, and of a deeper reddish purple colour then either the English or Hungarian
kindes: the greene leaues also are smaller then any other, lying on the ground, of a
deepe or sad greene colour, rising vp within a while after the flowers are past, and doe
abide greene all the Winter long: the roote is small and long, according to the rest of
the plant, and like in forme to the others.</p>

<p>This little kinde differeth not from the Spanish kinde last set forth, but in the varietie
of the flower, which is as small as the former; the three inner leaues being almost
all white, and the three outer leaues some of them pale or blush, and some party coloured,

</h4>

<p>This Physicall Medowe Saffron springeth vp with his leaues in Autumne, before
his flowers appeare beyond the nature of all the former kindes, yet the flower doth,
after they are vp, shew it selfe in the middle of the greene leaues, consisting of six white
leaues, with diuers chiues in the middle, and passeth away without giuing any seede
that euer I could obserue: the greene leaues abide all the Winter and Spring following,
decaying about May, and appeare not vntill September, when (as I said) the flowers
shew themselues presently after the leaues are sprung vp.</p>

  <span class="line">The darke purple Medowe Saffron.</span>
</h4>

<p>The greatest difference in this kinde consisteth in the flower, which at the first appearing
is as pale a purple, as the flower of the former Hungarian kinde: but after it
hath stood in flower two or three dayes, it beginneth to change, and will after a while
become to bee of a very deepe reddish purple colour, as also the little foote-stalke
whereon it doth stand: the flower is of the bignesse of the Hungarian purple, and so is
the greene leafe: the seede and roote is like the English purple kinde.</p>

</h4>

<p>We haue of late gained another sort of this kinde, differing chiefly in the flower,
which is diuersly striped thorough euery leafe of the flower, with a paler purple colour,
whereby the flower is of great beauty: this might seeme to bee a degeneration
from the former, yet it hath abiden constant with me diuers yeares, and giueth seede

<p>The double Medowe Saffron is in roote and leafe very like unto the English kinde:
the flowers are of a fine pale or delayed purple colour, consisting of many leaues set
thicke together, which are somewhat smaller, as in the English flower, being narrow
and long, and as it were round at the points, which make a very double flower, hauing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
some chiues with their yellow tips, dispersed as it were among the leaues in the middle:

<p>We haue another of these double kinds (if it be not the very same with the former,
varying in the flower as nature pleaseth oftentimes; for I haue this flower in my garden,
as I here set it forth, euery yeare) whose flowers are diuersified in the partition of the
colours, as is to be seene in the single party coloured Medowe Saffron before described,
hauing some leaues white, and others pale purple, and some leaues halfe white
and halfe purple, diuersly set or placed in the double flower, which doth consist of as
many leaues as the former, yet sometime this party coloured flower doth not shew it
selfe double like the former, but hath two flowers, one rising out of another, making
each of them to be almost but single flowers, consisting of eight or ten leaues a peece:
but this diuersity is not constant; for the same roote that this yeare appeareth in that
manner, the next yeare will returne to his former kinde of double flowers againe.</p>

  <span class="line">18. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colchicum Vernum.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Medowe Saffron of the Spring.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Medowe Saffron riseth vp very early in the yeare, that is, in the end of Ianuarie
sometimes, or beginning, or at the furthest the middle of February, presently after
the deepe Frosts and Snowes are past, with his flowers inclosed within three greene
leaues, which opening themselues as soone almost as they are out of the ground, shew
their buds for flowers within them very white oftentimes, before they open farre, and
sometimes also purplish at their first appearing, which neuer shew aboue two at the
most vpon one roote, and neuer rise aboue the leaues, nor the leaues much higher then
they, while they last: the flower consisteth of six leaues, long and narrow, euery leafe
being diuided, both at the bottome and toppe, each from other, and ioyned together
onely in the middle, hauing also six chiues, tipt with yellow in the middle, euery chiue
being ioyned to a leafe, of a pale red or deepe blush colour, when it hath stood a while
blowne, and is a smaller flower then any Medowe Saffron, except the small Spanish
kindes onely, but continueth in his beauty a good while, if the extremity of sharpe
Frosts and Windes doe not spoile it: the leaues wherein these flowers are enclosed, at
their first comming vp, are of a brownish greene colour, which so abide for a while,
especially on the outside, but on the inside they are hollow, and of a whitish or grayish
greene colour, which after the flowers are past, grow to bee of the length of a mans
longest finger, and narrow withall: there riseth vp likewise in the middle of them the
head or seede vessell, which is smaller and shorter, and harder then any of the former,
wherein is contained small round browne seede: the roote is small, somewhat like vnto
the rootes of the former, but shorter, and not hauing so long an eminence on the
one side of the bottome.</p>

<p>The flower of this Medowe Saffron, is in the rising vp of his leaues and flowers together,
and in all things else, like vnto the former, onely the flowers of this sort are at
their first appearing of a deeper purple colour, and when they are blowne also are
much deeper then the former, diuided in like manner, both at the bottome and toppe

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>All these Medowe Saffrons, or the most part of them, haue their places
expressed in their titles; for some grow in the fields and medowes of the
champion grounds, others on the mountaines and hilly grounds. The
English kindes grow in the West parts, as about Bathe, Bristow, Warmister<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>,
and other places also. The double kindes are thought to come out of
Germany.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>Their times likewise are declared in their seuerall descriptions: those
that are earliest in Autumne, flower in August and September, the later
in October, and the latest in the end of October, and in November. The
other are said to bee of the Spring, in regard they come after the deepe of
Winter (which is most vsually in December and Ianuary) is past.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The generall name to all these plants is <i>Colchicum</i>, whereunto some haue
added <i>Ephemerum</i>, because it killeth within one dayes space; and some
<i>Strangulatorium</i>. Some haue called them also <i>Bulbus Agrestis</i>, and <i>Filius ante
Patrem</i>, The Sonne before the Father, because (as they thinke) it giueth
seede before the flower: but that is without due consideration; for the root
of this (as of most other bulbous plants) after the stalke of leaues and seede
are dry, and past, may be transplanted, and then it beginneth to spring and
giue flowers before leaues, (and therein onely it is differing from other
plants) but the leaues and seede follow successiuely after the flowers, before
it may be remoued againe; so that here is not seede before flowers, but contrarily
flowers vpon the first planting or springing, and seede after, as in all
other plants, though in a diuers manner.</p>

<p>The <i>Colchicum Hermodactilum</i> may seeme very likely to bee the <i>Colchicum
Orientale</i> of Matthiolus, or the <i>Colchicum Alexandrinum</i> of Lobelius: And
some thinke it to be the true <i>Hermodactilus</i>, and so call it, but it is not so. We
doe generally call them all in English Medowe Saffrons, or <i>Colchicum</i>, according
to the Latine, giuing to euery one his other adiunct to know it by.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>None of these are vsed for any Physicall respect, being generally held
to be deadly, or dangerous at the least. Only the true Hermodactile (if it be
of this tribe, and not this which is here expressed) is of great vse, for paines
in the ioynts, and of the hippes, as the <i>Sciatica</i>, and the like, to be taken inwardly.
<cite>Costæus in his Booke of the nature of plants</cite>, saith, that the rootes
of our common kindes are very bitter in the Spring of the yeare, and sweet
in Autumne, which Camerarius contradicteth, saying, that he found them
bitter in Autumne, which were (as he saith) giuen by some imposters to diuers,
as an antidote against the Plague.</p>

Garden of dainty curiosity. To entreate therefore of these, I must, to obserue an orderly
declaration, diuide them into two primary families: the former shall be of those
that yeeld their pleasant flowers in the Spring of the yeare, and the other that send out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>

tame or manured kinde, properly called of the Garden, is to be comprehended, for
that it giueth his pleasant flowers at that time among others. I shall againe distribute
those of the Spring time into three chiefe colours, that is, into white, purple, and yellow,
and vnder euery one of them, comprehend the seuerall varieties that doe belong

the rest in generall are, of a pure white colour, without any mixture in it, which abide
not in flower aboue a weeke, or rather lesse, so sodainly is the pleasure of this, and the
purple lost: it flowreth not for the most part, vntill a moneth after the yellow Crocus
appeareth in flower, and the ordinary stript Crocus is past: the seede is small, round,
and reddish, yet not so red as the seede of the yellow, contained in three square heads,
yet seldome beareth, but encreaseth by the roote plentifully enough, which is small,
round, and flat at the bottome, somewhat white on the outside, but whiter within,
shooting out small sprouts on euery side of the roote, which is the best note to know

but herein this flower differeth, that it hath pale blewish lines and spots in all the

then of the white, and is more liberall in bearing: the roote is differing from all
the former, being rounder and bigger then any of them, except the kindes of Misia,
yet somewhat flat withall, not hauing any shootes from the sides, but setting off into
rootes plentifully, hauing a round circle compassing the bottome of the roote, which
easily falleth away, when it is taken vp out of the ground, and couered with a browne
coate, somewhat neare the colour of the yellow Crocus, but not altogether so
bright: it flowreth vsually the first of all these sorts, or with the first of the early yellowes.</p>

<p>The smaller purple Saffron flower of the Spring, hath his greene leaues so like vnto
the first white flowred Saffron, that they can hardly be distinguished, onely they seem
to bee a little narrower: the flower is also much about the same bignesse, or a little
bigger, and seldome beareth aboue one flower from a roote, euen as the first doth, of a
deepe purple Violet colour, the bottome of the flower, with the vpper part of the
stalke next thereunto, being of a deeper or blacker purple; in the middle of the flower
are some pale chiues tipt with yellow pendents, and a longer pointell, diuided or forked
at the toppe: the roote of this is in all things so like vnto the first white, that it is
impossible for the most cunning and conuersant in them, to know the one from the other.
This beareth seede very sparingly, as the white doth, and is reddish like vnto it,

<p>This great purple Crocus is of the same kinde with the next described, as well in

all other Crocus, with a large white line in the middle of euery one: it springeth vp
much later then the former, and doth not shew his flower vntill the other bee past a

equalling, if not surpassing that purple kinde that flowreth in Autumne, hereafter set

as in the former, among which riseth vp, out of diuers great long white skinnes, diuers

pale threeds, tipt with yellow, and a longer pointell of a gold yellow colour, forked
or diuided at the toppe, smelling sweeter then in the former, and abiding a great while
longer, being in flower vsually euen with the stript yellow Crocus, or before the former

<p>This kinde differeth very little from the former, either in roote, leafe, or flower,

purple colour on the outside, with three broad strakes or lines downe the backe of the

<p>This stript Saffron flower, is in leaues and flowers somewhat like vnto the last stript

leaues, striped with white lines, both on the leaues, and towards the edges, which maketh
a peculiar difference from all the rest: the roote of this is not so flat, though like

<p>The greene leaues of this Crocus or Saffron flower, are of a reasonable breadth and

middle of them, but rising not out of the ground so early as the next described Crocus:
the flowers are likewise of a meane bignesse, of a pale purple on the outside,
somewhat whitish, especially the three outer leaues; but on the inside of a deeper purple,

<p>This small kinde of Saffron flower riseth out of the ground, with two or three long
and small green leaues, very like vnto the leaues of the fine Fether-Grasse hereafter described,
standing vpright at the first, but afterwards lying vpon the ground; among
which come the flowers, sometimes three, but most vsually two vpon one stalke, if
the roote be not young, which then will beare but one on a stalke, which is very short,
so that the flowers scarce arise aboue the ground, yet laying themselues open in the
day time, if it be faire, and the Sunne doe shine, otherwise they keepe close, and doe
not open at all: and after one flower is past, which doth not last aboue three or foure
dayes at the most, the others follow, which are of a bleake blewish purple in the middle
of the flower, and of a deeper purple towards the ends or points or the leaues, but
of a more sullen or darke purple on the outside of them, and yellowish at the bottome,
with some yellow chiues in the middle: the seede is small and darker coloured then
any of the former Crocus, contained also in smaller heads, standing one by another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
vpon the same short foote-stalke, which then riseth vp a little higher, shewing the maner
of the standing of the flowers, which in their flowring time could not so easily bee
discerned: the roote is very small and round, hauing one side at the bottome lower
then the other, very like the roote of a <i>Colchicum</i> or Medowe Saffron, and somewhat

are very large, of a gold yellow colour, with some chiues, and a forked point in the

wee so call after the Dutch name <i>Gaud Laken</i>) is the true <i>Mæsiacus</i>, as some

neither a <i>Crocus</i>, although in the roote it come somewhat neare vnto that kinde that

I place it in the forefront of <a href="#Chap_2_XIX" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 19">the Chapter</a> of the <i>Iris bulbosa</i>, or bulbous Flowerdeluces,
because it doth not belong to that Family: and although the flower thereof doth most
resemble a Flowerdeluce, yet in that no other parts thereof doe fitly agree thereunto,
I haue rather chosen to seate it by it selfe betweene them both, as partaking of both
natures, and so may serue in stead of a bridge, to passe from the one to the other, that
is, from the <i>Crocus</i> or Saffron flower, to the <i>Iris bulbosa</i> or bulbous rooted Flowerdeluce,
which shall follow in the <a href="#Chap_2_XIX" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 19">next Chapter</a> by themselues.</p>

<p>The Spanish Nut hath two long and narrow, soft and smooth greene leaues, lying
for the most part vpon the ground, and sometimes standing vp, yet bending downewards;
betweene these leaues riseth vp a small stalke, halfe a foote high, hauing diuers
smooth soft greene leaues vpon it, as if they were skinnes, through which the stalke
passeth; at the toppe whereof stand diuers flowers, rising one after another, and not
all flowring at once: for seldome shall you haue aboue one flower blowne at a time,
each whereof doth so quickly passe and fade away, that one may well say, that it is but
one dayes flower, or rather the flower of a few houres: the flower it selfe hath nine
leaues, like vnto a Flowerdeluce, whereof the three that fall downe, haue in each of
them a yellow spot: the other three, which in the Flowerdeluces are hollow and
ridged, couering the other three that fall downe, in this stand vpright, and are parted
at the ends: the three that stand vp in the middle are small and short: the whole flower
is smaller then any Flowerdeluce, but of sundry colours; for some are of an excellent
skie colour blew, others of a Violet purple, others of a darker purple colour, and some
white, and many others mixed, either pale blew and deepe purple, or white and blew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
mixed or striped together very variably, quickly fading as I said before: the seede is
enclosed in small cods, so thinne and transparent that one may easily see, and tell the
seeds as they lye, which are of a brownish red colour: the roote is small, blackish and
round, wrapped in a thicke skinne or huske, made like vnto a net, or somewhat like
vnto the roote of the cloth of gold Crocus: when the plant is in flower, it is found to
haue two rootes one aboue another, whereof the vppermost is firme and sound, and
the vndermost loose and spongie, in like manner as is found in the rootes of diuers Orchides
or Satyrions, Bee-flowers and the like, and without any good taste, or sweetnesse
at all, although Clusius saith otherwise.</p>

<p>There is another of this kinde, not differing from the former in any other notable
part, but in the flower, which in this is of a delayed purplish red colour, hauing in each
of the three lower leaues a white spot, in stead of the yellow in the former, but are as
soone fading as they.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The former doe grow very plentifully in many parts both of Spaine and

often in this Booke, found them; of the sundry colours specified, whereas
Clusius maketh mention but of one colour that he found.</p>

<p>The other was found in that part of Barbary, where Fez and Morocco do
stand, and brought first into the Lowe-Countries: but they are both very
tender, and will hardly abide the hard Winters of these colder regions.</p>

<p>The first flowreth in May and Iune, the last not vntill August.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The name <i>Sisyrinchium</i> is generally imposed vpon this plant, by all authors
that haue written thereof, thinking it to bee the right <i>Sisyrinchium</i> of
Theophrastus: but concerning the Spanish name <i>Nozelha</i>, which Clusius
saith it is called by in Spaine, I haue beene credibly enformed by the aforenamed
Boel, that this roote is not so called in those parts; but that the small
or common stript Crocus is called <i>Nozelha</i>, which is sweete in taste, and
desired very greedily by the Shepheards and Children, and that the roote
of this <i>Sisyrinchium</i> or Spanish Nut, is without any taste, and is not eaten.
And againe, that there is not two kindes, although it grow greater, and
with more flowers, in those places that are neare the Sea, where both the
washing of the Sea water, and the moisture and ayre of the Sea, causeth the
ground to bee more fertile. This I thought good, from the true relation
of a friend, to giue the world to vnderstand, that truth might expell errour.</p>

doe couer them at the bottome, stand like the vpright leaues of other Flowerdeluces,
but are parted into two ends, like vnto two small eares: the whole flower is of a faire

thinke, that some in their trauels through Spaine, or other parts
where it groweth, being delighted with the beauty of the flower, did
gather the rootes, and bring them ouer with them, and dwelling in some
of the West parts of England, planted them, and there encreasing so
plentifully as they doe, they were imparted to many, thereby in time
growing common in all Countrey folkes Gardens thereabouts. They

differences, either in leafe or flower, for bignesse, colour, or forme, as is expedient
to expresse and distinguish them seuerally. This greater white bulbous Flowerdeluce
is like vnto the last described in all parts, sauing that it is a little larger and higher, both
in leafe, stalke, and flower, and much whiter then any of these mixed sorts that follow,

</h5>

<p>This Flowerdeluce as it is more strange (that is, but lately knowne and possessed
by a few) so it is both more desired, and of more beauty then others. It is in all
respects, of roote, leafe, and flower, for the forme like vnto the middle sort of these
Flowerdeluces, onely the lowest part of the leaues and stalke, for an inch or thereabouts,
next vnto the ground, are of a reddish colour, spotted with many spots, and the
flower, being of a meane size, is of a deepe purplish red or murrey colour the whole

leafed Flowerdeluces, in all the parts of it; for the roote is greater
then any of the other, being thicke and short: the leaues are broader and
longer, but of the same colour: the stalke is stronger and higher then any of
them, bearing two or three flowers, larger also then any of the rest, whose
falling leaues are of a duskie yellow, and sometimes with veines and borders
about the brimmes, of another dunne colour, yet hauing that yellow
spot that is in all: the arched leaues are of a sullen pale purplish yellow, and
the vpright leaues of a dull or duskie blewish purple colour: the heads or
hornes for seede are likewise greater, and so is the seede also a little.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Place.</h5>

<p>These Flowerdeluces haue had their originall out of Spaine and Portugall,
as it is thought, except those that haue risen by the sowing, and those
which are named of Africa.</p>

</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Time.</h5>

<p>These flower in Iune, and sometimes abide vnto Iuly, but vsually not so

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Names.</h5>

<p>The seuerall names, both in Latine and English, are sufficient for them as

<h4 class="nobreak faux" title="">{Conclusion}</h4>

<p>And thus much for these sorts of bulbous Flowerdeluces, and yet I doubt not, but
that there are many differences, which haue risen by the sowing of the seede, as many
may obserue from their owne labours, for that euery yeare doth shew forth some variety
that is not seene before. And now I will conuert my discourse a while likewise,
to passe through the seuerall rankes of the other kindes of tuberous rooted Flowerdeluces,
called Flagges.</p>

  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iris Chalcedonica siue Susiana maior.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The great Turkie Flowerdeluce.</span>
</h5>

<p>The great Turkie Flowerdeluce, hath diuers heads of long and broad fresh greene
leaues, yet not so broad as many other of those that follow, one folded within another
at the bottome, as all other of these Flowerdeluces are: from the middle of some
one of those heads (for euery head of leaues beareth not a flower) riseth vp a round
stiffe stalke, two foote high, at the toppe whereof standeth one flower (for I neuer obserued
it to beare two) the largest almost, but rarest of all the rest, consisting of nine
leaues, like the others that follow, but of the colour almost of a Snakes skinne, it is so
diuersly spotted; for the three lower falling leaues are very large, of a deepe or darke
purple colour, almost blacke, full of grayish spots, strakes, and lines through the whole
leaues, with a blacke thrume or freeze in the middle of each of them: the three arched
leaues that couer them, are of the same darke purple colour, yet a little paler at the
sides, the three vpper leaues are very large also, and of the same colour with the lower
leaues, but a little more liuely and fresh, being speckled and straked with whiter spots
and lines; which leaues being laid in water, will colour the water into a Violet colour,
but if a little Allome be put therein, and then wrung or pressed, and the iuice of these
leaues dryed in the shadow, will giue a colour almost as deepe as Indico, and may
serue for shawdowes in limming excellent well: the flower hath no sent that can be perceiued,
but is onely commendable for the beauty and rarity thereof: it seldome beareth
seedes in these cold Countries, but when it doth, it is contained in great heads,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
being brownish and round, but not so flat as in other sorts, the roots are more browne
on the outside, and growing tuberous thicke, as all other that are kept in Gardens.</p>

<p>There is another hereof little differing, but that the leafe is of a more yellowish
greene colour, and the flower neither so large or faire, nor of so perspicuous markes
and spots, nor the colour of that liuely (though darke) lustre.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Place.</h5>

<p>These haue been sent out of Turkie diuers times among other things, and
it should seeme, that they haue had their originall from about Susis, a chiefe

<p>They flower in May most vsually, before any of the other kindes.</p>

  <span class="line">The white Flowerdeluce.</span>
</h5>

<p>The great white Flowerdeluce, hath many heads of very broad and flat long leaues,
enclosing or folding one within another at the bottome, and after a little diuided one
from another toward the top, thin edged, like a sword on both sides, and thicker in the
middle: from the middle of some of these heads of leaues, riseth vp a round stiffe stalk,
two or three foot high, bearing at the top one, two, or three large flowers, out of seuerall
huskes or skins, consisting of nine leaues, as all the other do, of a faire white colour,
hauing in the middle of each of the three falling leaues, a small long yellow frize or
thrume, as is most vsuall in all the sorts of the following Flowerdeluces, both of the
greater and smaller kindes: after the flowers are past, come the seed, inclosed in thicke
short pods, full fraught or stored with red roundish and flat seede, lying close one vpon
another: the roote is tuberous or knobby, shooting out from euery side much like tuberous
heads, lying for the most part vpon or aboue the ground, and fastened within the
ground with long white strings or fibres, which hold them strongly, and encreaseth
fast. There

<span class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flore pallido.</i></span> is another like vnto this last in all things, sauing that the colour of the

<p>This variable Flowerdeluce is like vnto the former, but that the leaues are not so
large and broad, the flower hereof is as large almost, and as white as the former, but it
hath a faire list or line of a blewish purple downe the backe of euery one of the three
vpright leaues, and likewise round about the edges, both of the vpper and lower
leaues, and also a little more purplish vpon the ridge of the arched leaues, that couer

onely the colour of the flower is differing, being of a faire watchet or bleake
blew colour wholly, with the yellow frize or thrum downe the middle of the lower
or falling leaues, as before is said to be common to all these sorts of Flowerdeluces; in
all other parts it little differeth, sauing onely this is obserued to haue a small shew of a

<p>This Flowerdeluce, which is most common in Gardens, differeth nothing at all
from those that are formerly described, either in roote, leafe, or flower for the forme
of them, but onely that the leaues of this are not so large as the last, and the flower it
selfe is of a deep purple or Violet colour, and sometimes a little declining to rednesse,
especially in some places.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Purpurea pallidior

<p>Sometimes this kinde of Flowerdeluce will haue flowers of a paler purple colour,

that this is not so large in leaues, or flowers, and that it doth often flower twice in a

the leaues of the common purple Flowerdeluce, and so is the flower also, but differing
in colour, for the three lower leaues are of a deepe purple colour tending to rednesse,
the three arched leaues are of the colour with the vpper leaues, which are of a

a blew, that we may well call it an ash-colour: And lastly, there is another of this sort,
whose vpright leaues are of a faire pale blew, with yellowish edges, and the falling
leaues parted into two colours, sometimes equally in the halfe, each side sutable to the
other in colour: And sometimes hauing the one leafe in that manner: And sometimes
but with a diuers coloured list in them; in the other parts both of flower and
leafe, like vnto the other.</p>

<h5 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iris lutea variegata.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The yellow variable Flowerdeluce.</span>
</h5>

<p>This yellow variable Flowerdeluce loseth his leaues in Winter, contrary to all the
former Flowerdeluces, so that his roote remaineth vnder ground without any shew of
leafe vpon it: but in the beginning of the Spring it shooteth out faire broad leaues,
falling downwards at the points or ends, but shorter many times then any of the former,
and so is the stalke likewise, not rising much aboue a foote high, whereon are set
two or three large flowers, whose falling leaues are of a reddish purple colour, the three
that stand vpright of a smoakie yellow, the arched leaues hauing their ridges of a
bleake colour tending to purple, the sides being of the former smoakie yellow colour,
with some purplish veines at the foote or bottome of all the leaues: the roote groweth
somewhat more slender and long vnder ground, and of a darker colour then manie of
the other.</p>

<p>Another sort hath the vpright leaues of a reasonable faire yellow, and stand more
vpright, not bowing downe as most of the other, and the purple fals haue pale edges.
Some
<span class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Varietas.</i></span> haue their greene leaues party coloured, white and greene, more or lesse, and so
are the huskes of the flowers, the arched leaues yellow, as the vpright leaues are, with
purplish veines at the bottome. And some haue both the arched and vpright leaues of
so pale a yellow, that we may almost call it a straw colour, but yellower at the bottome,
with purple veines, and the falling leaues purple, with two purple spots in them.</p>

<p>And these are the sorts of the greater tuberous or Flagge Flowerdeluces that haue
come to our knowledge: the next hereunto are the lesser or narrow leafed kindes to be

<p>This Flowerdeluce I place in the forefront of the narrow leafed Flowerdeluces,
for the length of the leaues, compared with the breadth of them; it may fitly bee called
a narrow leafed Flowerdeluce, although they be an inch broad, which is broader
then any of them that follow, or some of those are set downe before, but as I said, the
length make them seem narrow, and therefore let it take vp his roome in this place, with
the description that followeth. It beareth leaues a yard long, or not much lesse, and
an inch broad, as is said before, or more, of a sad greene colour, but not shining: the

<p>Next after these narrow leafed Flowerdeluces, are the greater and smaller sorts of

<p>This dwarfe Flowerdeluce hath his leaues as broad as some of the lesser kindes last
mentioned, but not shorter; the stalke is very short, not aboue halfe a foote high or
thereabouts, bearing most commonly but one flower, seldome two, which are in some
of a pure white, in others paler, or somewhat yellowish through the whole flower, except
the yellow frize or thrume in the middle of euery one of the falling leaues: after
the flowers are past, come forth great heads, containing within them round pale seed:
the roote is small, according to the proportion of the plant aboue ground, but made

  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chamæiris latifolia maior purpurea.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The greater purple dwarfe Flowerdeluce.</span>
</h5>

<p>There is no difference either in roote, leafe, or forme of flower in this from the former
dwarfe kinde, but onely in the colour of the flower, which in some is of a very
deepe or blacke Violet purple, both the toppes and the fals: in others the Violet purple
is more liuely, and in some the vpper leaues are blew, and the lower leaues purple,
yet all of them haue that yellow frize or thrume in the middle of the falling leaues,
that the other kindes haue.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Altera.</i></div>

<p>There is also another sort of these Flowerdeluces, whose leaues and flowers are
lesse, and wherein there is much variety. The leaues of this kinde, are all for the most
part somewhat smaller, narrower, and shorter then the former: the stalke with the
flower vpon it scarce riseth above the leaues, so that in most of them it may be rather
called a foote-stalke, such as the Saffron flowers haue, and are therefore called of manie
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκαυλοι</span>, without stalkes; the flowers are like vnto the first described of the dwarfe
kindes, and of a whitish colour, with a few purplish lines at the bottome of the vpper

<p>The difference of this from the former, consisteth more in the colour then forme of
the flower, which is of a deep Violet purple, sometimes paler, and sometimes so deep,
that it almost seemeth blacke: And sometimes the fals purplish, and the vpper leaues
blew. Some of these haue a sweete sent, and some none.</p>

rise vp diuers stalkes, bearing at the toppe two or three sweete flowers, as small as any

vnder these appeare three browne aglets, like vnto birds tongues: the three vpper
leaues are small and narrow, of a perfect purple or Violet colour: the heads for seede
haue sharper and harder cornered edges then the former: the seedes are somewhat

<p>This Flowerdeluce is in leaues, flowers, and rootes so like the last described, that
but onely it is smaller and lower, it is not to be distinguished from the other. And this
may suffice for these sorts of Flowerdeluces, that furnish the Gardens of the curious

  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iris tuberosa.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The Veluet Flowerdeluce.</span>
</h4>

<p>Vnto the Family of Flowerdeluces, I must needes ioyne this peculiar kinde, because
of the neare resemblance of the flower, although it differ both in roote and leafe; lest
therefore it should haue no place, let it take vp a roome here in the end of the Flowerdeluces,
with this description following. It hath many small and foure square leaues,
two foote long and aboue sometimes, of a grayish greene colour, stiffe at the first, but
afterwards growing to their full length, they are weak and bend downe to the ground:
out of the middle, as it were of one of these leaues, breaketh out the stalke, a foot high
and better, with some leaues thereon, at the toppe whereof, out of a huske riseth one
flower, (I neuer saw more on a stalke) consisting of nine leaues, whereof the three that
fall downe are of a yellowish greene colour round about the edges, and in the middle
of so deepe a purple, that it seemeth to be blacke, resembling blacke Veluet: the three
arched leaues, that couer the lower leaues to the halfe, are of the same greenish colour
that the edges and backside of the lower leaues are: the three vppermost leaues, if
they may be called leaues, or rather short peeces like eares, are green also, but wherein
a glimpse of purple may be seene in them: after the flower is past, there followeth a
round knob or whitish seede vessell, hanging downe by a small foote-stalke, from betweene
the huske, which is diuided as it were into two leaues, wherein is contained
round white seede. The roote is bunched or knobbed out into long round rootes,
like vnto fingers, two or three from one peece, one distant from another, and one
longer then another, for the most part of a darkish gray colour, and reddish withall on
the outside, and somewhat yellowish within.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Place.</h5>

<p>It hath beene sent out of Turkie oftentimes (as growing naturally thereabouts)
and not knowne to grow naturally any where else.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Time.</h5>

<p>It flowreth in Aprill or May, sometimes earlier or later, as the Spring
falleth out to be milde or sharpe.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Names.</h5>

<p>Matthiolus contendeth to make it the true <i>Hermodadactylus</i>, rather from
the shew of the rootes, which (as is said) are like vnto fingers, then from any
other good reason: for the rootes hereof eyther dry or greene, do nothing
resemble the true <i>Hermodactyli</i> that are vsed in Physicke, as any that knoweth
them may easily perceiue, either in forme or vertue. It is more truely
referred to the Flowerdeluces, and because of the tuberous rootes, called
<i>Iris tuberosa</i>, although all the Flowerdeluces in this Chapter haue tuberous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>rootes, yet this much differing from them all. In English it is vsually called,
The Veluet Flowerdeluce, because the three falling leaues seeme to be like
smooth blacke Veluet.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>Both the rootes and the flowers of the great Flowerdeluces, are of great
vse for the purging and cleansing of many inward, as well as outward diseases,
as all Authors in Physicke doe record. Some haue vsed also the greene
rootes to cleanse the skinne, but they had neede to be carefull that vse them,
lest they take more harme then good by the vse of them. The dryed rootes
called <i>Orris</i> (as is said) is of much vse to make sweete powders, or other
things to perfume apparrell or linnen. The iuice or decoction of the green
roots doth procure both neezing to be snuft vp into the nostrils, and vomiting
very strongly being taken inwardly.</p>

a little arched or bunching vp in the middle, of a faire reddish purple colour, with two
white spots within the mouth thereof, one on each side, made like vnto a Lozenge
that is square and long pointed: after the flowers are past, come vp round heads or
seede vessels, wherein is contained reddish flat seede, like vnto the seede of the Fritillaria,
but thicker and fuller: the roote is somewhat great, round, flat, and hard, with a
shew as if it were netted, hauing another short spongie one vnder it, which when it
hath done bearing, and the stalke dry, that the roote may be taken vp, sticketh close to
the bottome, but may be easily taken away, hauing vsually a number of small rootes
encreased about it, the least whereof will quickly grow, so that if it be suffered any long

any other difference, then that the roote is smaller and browner, the leafe and
stalke of a darker colour, and the flowers (being of a little darker colour like the former,
and somewhat smaller) stand out on both sides of the stalke.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gladiolus Byzantinus.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Corne Flagge of Constantinople.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Corne Flagge that came first from Constantinople, is in all things like vnto
the French Corne Flagge last described, but that it is larger, both in rootes, leaues, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>flowers, and likewise that the Flowers of this, which stand not on both sides, are of a
deeper red colour, and flower later, after all the rest are past: the roote hereof being
netted as plainly as any of the former, is as plentifull also to giue encrease, but is more
tender and lesse able to abide our sharpe cold Winters.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gladiolus flore rubente.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Blush Corne Flagge.</span>
</h4>

<p>This blush kinde is like vnto the French Corne Flagge in all respects, sauing onely
that the flowers are of a pale red colour, tending to whitenesse, which wee vsually call
a blush colour.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gladiolus flore albo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">White Corne Flagge.</span>
</h4>

<p>This white Corne Flagge also differeth not from the last, but onely that the rootes
are whiter on the outside, the leaues are greener, without any brownesse or darknesse
as in the former, and the flowers are snow white.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gladiolus purpureus minor.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The small purple Corne Flagge.</span>
</h4>

<p>This also differeth not from any of the former, but onely in the smallnesse both of
leafe, stalke, and flowers, which stand all on the one side, like vnto the French kinde,
and of the same colour: the roote of this kinde is netted more then any other.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>They grow in France and Italy, the least in Spaine, and the Byzantine,
as it is thought, about Constantinople, being (as is said) first sent from
thence. Iohn Tradescante assured mee, that hee saw many acres of ground
in Barbary spread ouer with them.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They all flower in Iune and Iuly, and the Byzantine latest, as is said before.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>It hath diuers names; for the Latines call it <i>Gladiolus</i>, of the forme of a
sword, which the leafe doth resemble. The Romanes <i>Segetalis</i>, because it
groweth in the Corne fields. Some call it <i>Victorialis rotunda</i>, to put a difference
between it, and the <i>longa</i>, which is a kinde of Garlicke. Plinie saith,
that <i>Gladiolus</i> is <i>Cypirus</i>, but to decide that controuersie, and many others,
belongeth to another discourse, this being intended only for pleasure. Gerrard
mistaketh the French kinde for the Italian.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The roote being bruised, and applyed with Frankinsense (and often of
it selfe without it) in the manner of a pultis or plaister, is held of diuers to
be singular good to draw out splinters, thornes, and broken bones out of
the flesh. Some take it be effectuall to stirre vp Venerie, but I somewhat
doubt thereof: For <cite>Galen in his eighth Booke of Simples</cite>, giueth vnto it a
drawing, digesting and drawing faculty.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">A<span class="looks_big">l</span>though it is not my purpose in this place, to giue a generall history of all the
sorts of Orchides, Satyrions, and the rest of that kinde; yet because many of
them are very pleasant to behold, and, if they be planted in a conuenient place,
will abide some time in Gardens, so that there is much pleasure taken in them: I shall
intrude some of them for curiosities sake, to make vp the prospect of natures beautifull
variety, and only entreate of a few, leauing the rest to a more ample declaration.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Satyrium Basilicum siue Palma Christi mas.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The greater male handed Satyrion.</span>
</h4>

<p>This handed Satyrion hath for the most part but three faire large greene leaues,
neare vnto the ground, spotted with small blackish markes: from among which riseth
vp a stalke, with some smaller leaues thereon, bearing at the toppe a bush or spike of
flowers, thicke set together, euery one whereof is made like a body, with the belly
broader belowe then aboue, where it hath small peeces adioyned vnto it: the flower
is of a faire purple colour, spotted with deeper purple spots, and hauing small peeces
like hornes hanging at the backes of the flowers, and a small leafe at the bottome of the
foote-stalke of euery flower: the rootes are not round, like the other Orchides, but
somewhat long and flat, like a hand, with small diuisions belowe, hanging downe like
the fingers of a hand, cut short off by the knockles, two alwayes growing together,
with some small fibres or strings aboue the heads of these rootes, at the bottome of
the stalke.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Satyrium Basilicum siue Palma Christi fæmina.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The female handed Satyrion.</span>
</h4>

<p>This female Satyrion hath longer and narrower leaues then the former, and spotted
with more and greater spots, compassing the stalke at the bottome like the other: this
beareth likewise a bush of flowers, like vnto the other, but that each of these haue heads
like hoods, whereas the former haue none: in some they are white with purple spots,
and in others of a reddish purple, with deepe or darke coloured spots: the roots are alike.</p>

<p>The rootes of this kinde take part with both the sorts of <i>Orchis</i> and <i>Satyrium</i>, being
neither altogether round, nor fully handed, and thereupon it tooke the name, to signifie
both kindes: the leaues are two in number, seldome more, being faire and broad,
like vnto the leaues of Lillies, without any spot at all in them: at the toppe of the
stalke stand many white flowers, not so thicke set as the first or second, euery one being
fashioned like vnto a white Butterflie, with the wings spread abroad.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">

  <span class="line">The Bee flower or Bee Orchis.</span>
</h4>

<p>This is a small and lowe plant for the most part, with three or foure small narrow
leaues at the bottome: the stalke is seldome above halfe a foote high, with foure or fiue
flowers thereon one aboue another, hauing round bodies, and somewhat flat, of a kind
of yellowish colour, with purple wings aboue them, so like vnto an honey Bee, that it
might soone deceiue one that neuer had seene such a flower before: the roots are two
together, round and white, hauing a certaine <i>muccilaginesse</i> or clamminesse within
them, without any taste almost at all, as all or the most part of these kindes haue.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orchis Sphegodes.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Gnats Satyrion.</span>
</h4>

<p>The leaues of this Orchis are somewhat larger then of the Bee flower, the stalke also
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>somewhat higher: the flowers are fewer on the toppe, but somewhat larger then of
the Bee flowers, made to the resemblance of a Gnat or great long Flie: the rootes are
two round bulbes, as the other are.</p>

<p>The Flie Orchis is like vnto the last described, both in leafe and roote, the difference
is in the flower, which is neither so long as the Gnat Satyrion, nor so great as the
Bee Orchis, but the neather part of the Flie is blacke, with a list of ash-colour crossing
the backe, with a shew of legges hanging at it: the naturall Flie seemeth so to bee in
loue with it, that you shall seldome come in the heate of the day, but you shall finde
one sitting close thereon.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>These grow in many places of England, some in the Woods, as the Butterflie,
and the two former handed Satyrions: others on dry bankes and
barren balkes in Kent, and many other places.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower for the most part in the beginning or middle of May, or
thereabouts.</p>
</div>

<p>Their seuerall names are expressed in their titles, so much as may suffice

<p>All the kindes of Orchis are accounted to procure bodily lust, as well the

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">V<span class="looks_big">n</span>to the kindes of Orchides, may fitly be ioyned another plant, which by
many is reckoned to be a <i>Satyrium</i>, both from the forme of roote and leafe,
and from the efficacy or vertue correspondent thereunto. And although it
cannot be the <i>Satyrium Erythronium</i> of Dioscorides, as some would entitle it, for that
as I haue shewed before, his <i>Satyrium tryphillum</i> is the Tulipa without all doubt; yet
because it differeth very notably, and carrieth more beauty and respect in his flower
then they, I shall entreate thereof in a Chapter by it selfe, and set it next vnto them.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dens Caninus flore albo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Dogs tooth Violet with a white flower.</span>
</h4>

<p>The white Dogs tooth hath for his roote a white bulbe, long and small, yet vsually
greater then either of the other that follow, bigger belowe then aboue, with a small
peece adioyning to the bottome of it, from whence rise vp in the beginning of the
Spring, after the Winter frosts are past, two leaues for the most part (when it will
flower, or else but one, and neuer three together that euer I saw) closed together when
they first come vp out of the ground, which inclose the flower betweene them: the
leaues when they are opened do lay themselues flat on the ground, or not much aboue
it, one opposite vnto the other, with the stalke and the flower on it standing betweene
them, which leaues are of a whitish greene colour, long and narrow, yet broader in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
middle then at both ends, growing lesse by degrees each way, spotted and striped all
ouer the leaues with white lines and spots: the stalke riseth vp halfe a foote high or
more, bearing at the toppe one flower and no more, hanging downe the head, larger
then any of the other of this kinde that follow, made or consisting of six white long
and narrow leaues, turning themselues vp againe, after it hath felt the comfort of the
Sunne, that they doe almost touch the stalke againe, very like vnto the flowers of <i>Cyclamen</i>
or Sowebread: it hath in the middle of the flower six white chiues, tipt with
darke purple pendents, and a white three forked stile in the middle of them: the flower
hath no sent at all, but commendable onely for the beauty and forme thereof: after
the flower is past, commeth in the place a round head seeming three square, containing
therein small and yellowish seede.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dens Caninus flore purpurascente.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Dogs tooth with a pale purple flower.</span>
</h4>

<p>This other Dogs tooth is like vnto the former, but lesser in all parts, the leafe
whereof is not so long, but broad and short, spotted with darker lines and spots: the
flower is like the other, but smaller, and of a delayed purple colour, very pale sometimes,
and sometimes a little deeper, turning it selfe as the other, with a circle round
about the vmbone or middle, the chiues hereof are not white, but declining to purple:
the roote is white, and like vnto the former, but lesser, as is said before.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dens Caninus flore rubro.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Dogs tooth with a red flower.</span>
</h4>

<p>This is in all things like vnto the last, both for forme and bignesse of flower and
leafe: the chiefe difference consisteth in this, that the leaues hereof are of a yellowish
mealy greene colour, spotted and streaked with redder spots and stripes, and the
flower of a deeper reddish purple colour, and the chiues also more purplish then the
last, in all other things it is alike.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The sorts <i>Dens Caninus</i> doe growe in diuers places; some in Italy on
the Euganean Hils, others on the Apenine, and some about Gratz, the chiefe
Citie of Stiria, and also about Bayonne, and in other places.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower in March most vsually, and many times in Aprill, according
to the seasonablenesse of the yeare.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>Clusius did call it first <i>Dentali</i>, and Lobel, and from him some others <i>Satyrium</i>,
and <i>Erythronium</i>, but I haue said enough hereof in the beginning of
<a href="#Chap_2_XXIII" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 23">the Chapter</a>. It is most commonly called <i>Dens Caninus</i>, and we in English,
either Dogs tooth, or Dogs tooth Violet. Gesner called it <i>Hermodactylus</i>,
and Matthiolus <i>Pseudohermodactylus</i>.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The roote hereof is held to bee of more efficacy for venerous effects,
then any of the Orchides and Satyrions.</p>

<p>They of Stiria vse the rootes for the falling sicknesse.</p>

<p>Wee haue had from Virginia a roote sent vnto vs, that wee might well
iudge, by the forme and colour thereof being dry, to be either the roote of
this, or of an Orchis, which the naturall people hold not onely to be singular
to procure lust, but hold it as a secret, loth to reueale it.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e likenesse of the flowers, and the spotting of the leaues of the <i>Dens Caninus</i>,
with these of the <i>Cyclamen</i> or Sowebread, maketh mee ioyne it next thereunto:
as also that after the bulbous rooted plants I might begin with the tuberous
that remaine, and make this plant the beginning of them. Of this kinde there are
diuers sorts, differing both in forme of leaues and time of flowring: for some doe
flower in the Spring of the yeare, others afterwards in the beginning of Summer: but
the most number in the end of Summer, or beginning of Autumne or Haruest, whereof
some haue round leaues, others cornered like vnto Iuie, longer or shorter, greater or
smaller. Of them all in order, and first of those that come in the Spring.</p>

  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyclamen Vernum flore purpureo.</i></span>

<p>This Sowebread hath a smaller roote then most of the others, yet round and blackish
on the outside, as all or most of the rest are (I speake of them that I haue seene; for
Clusius and others doe report to haue had very great ones) from whence rise vp diuers
round, yet pointed leaues, and somewhat cornered withall, greene aboue, and
spotted with white spots circlewise about the leafe, and reddish vnderneath, which at
their first comming vp are folded together; among which come the flowers, of a reddish
purple colour and very sweete, euery one vpon a small, long, and slender reddish
foote-stalke, which hanging downe their heads, turne vp their leaues againe: after the
flowers are past, the head or seede vessel shrinketh downe, winding his footestalke,
and coyling it selfe like a cable, which when it toucheth the ground, there abideth hid
among the leaues, till it be growne great and ripe, wherein are contained a few small
round seedes, which being presently sowne, will growe first into round rootes, and afterwards
from them shoote forth leaues.</p>

<p>The white flowring Sowebread hath his leaues like the former, but not fully so
much cornered, bearing small snow white flowers, as sweete as the other: and herein
consisteth the chiefest difference, in all other things it is alike.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyclamen Vernum Creticum flore albo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">White Candy Sowebread of the Spring.</span>

<p>This Sowebread is somewhat like the former white kinde, but that the leaues grow
much larger and longer, with more corners at the edges, and more eminent spots on
them: the flowers also somewhat longer and larger, and herein consisteth the whole
difference.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">

<p>Summer Sowebread hath round leaues like vnto the Romane Sowebread, but somewhat
cornered, yet with shorter corners then the Iuie leafed Sowebread, full of white
spots on the vpperside of the leaues, and very purple vnderneath, sometimes they haue
fewer spots, and little or no purple vnderneath: the flowers hereof are as small, as
purple, and as sweete, as the purple Sowebread of the Spring time: the roote hereof
is likewise small, blacke, and round.</p>

  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyclamen Romanum rotundifolium.</i></span>

<p>The Romane Sowebread hath round leaues, somewhat like vnto the common
Sowebread, but not fully so round pointed at the ends, a little cornered sometimes
also, or as it were indented, with white spots round about the middle of the leaues,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and very conspicuous, which make it seeme the more beautifull: the flowers appeare
in Autumne, and are shorter, and of a deeper purplish red colour then the Iuie Sowebread,
rising vp before the leaues for the most part, or at least with them, and little or
nothing sweete: the roote is round and blacke, vsually not so flat as it, but growing
sometimes to bee greater then any other kinde of Sowebread. There is sometimes<span class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Varietas.</i></span>
some variety to be seene, both in the leaues and flowers of this kinde; for that sometime
the leaues haue more corners, and either more or lesse spotted with white; the
flowers likewise of some are larger or lesser, longer or rounder, paler or deeper coloured
one then another. This happeneth most likely from the sowing of the seede, causing
the like variety as is seene in the Iuie leafed Sowebread. It doth also many times
happen from the diuersity of soyles and countries where they grow: the seed of this,
as of all the rest, is small and round, contained in such like heads as the former, standing
almost like the head of a Snake that is twined or folded within the body thereof.
This and the other Autumnall kindes, presently after their sowing in Autumne, shoote
forth leaues, and so abide all the Winter, according to their kinde.</p>

  <span class="line">Iuie leafed Sowebread.</span>
</h4>

<p>The Iuie leafed Sowebread groweth in the same manner that the former doth, that
is, bringeth forth flowers with the leaues sometimes, or most commonly before them,
whose flowers are greater then the common round leafed Sowebread, somewhat
longer then the former Romane or Italian Sowebreads, and of a paler purple colour,
almost bluish, without that sweete sent as is in the first kinde of the Spring: the greene
leaues hereof are more long then round, pointed at the ends, and hauing also one or
two corners on each side, sometimes much spotted on the vpperside with white spots
and marks, and sometimes but a little or not at all; and so likewise sometimes more or
lesse purple vnderneath: all the leaues and flowers doe stand vsually euery one seuerally
by themselues, vpon their owne slender foote-stalkes, as most of all the other
kindes doe:<span class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Varietas.</i></span> but sometimes it happeneth, that both leaues and flowers are found growing
from one and the same stalke, which I rather take to be accidentall, then naturall so
to continue: the seede hereof is like the former kindes, which being sowne produceth
variety, both in the forme of the leaues, and colour and smell of the flowers: some being
paler or deeper, and some more or lesse sweete then others: the leaues also, some
more or lesse cornered then others: the root groweth to be great, being round and flat,
and of a blackish browne colour on the outside.</p>

<p>There is one of this kinde, whose leaues are rounder, and not so much cornered as
the former, flowring in Autumne as the last doth, and whose flowers are wholly
white, not hauing any other notable difference therein.</p>

  <span class="line">Long leafed Sowebread.</span>
</h4>

<p>This kinde of Sowebread may easily be knowne from all the other kindes, because
his leafe is longer and narrower then others, fashioned at the bottome thereof with

former sorts for forme, but of a purple colour. There is also another of this kinde in

  <span class="line">Double flowred Sowebread of Antioch.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Sowebread of Antioch with double flowers, hath his leaues somewhat round,
like vnto the leaues of the Summer Sowebread, but with lesse notches or corners, &amp; full
of white spots on them: it beareth flowers on stalks, like vnto others, &amp; likewise some
stalks that haue two or three flowers on them, which are very large, with ten or twelue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
leaues a peece, of a faire Peach colour, like vnto the flowers of purple Sowebread of
the Spring, and deeper at the bottome.</p>

<p>There are of this kinde some, whose flowers appeare in the Spring, and are as large
and double as the former, but of a pure white colour.</p>

<p>There are of these Sowebreads of Antioch, that haue but single flowers, some appearing
in the Spring, and others in Autumne.</p>

  <span class="line">10. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyclamen vulgare folio rotundo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The common Sowebread.</span>
</h4>

<p>The common Sowebread (which is most vsed in the Apothecaries Shops) hath
many leaues spread vpon the ground, rising from certaine small long heads, that are
on the greater round rootes, as vsually most of the former sorts doe, being in the like
manner folded together, and after spread themselues into round greene leaues, somewhat
like vnto the leaues of <i>Asarum</i>, but not shining, without any white spots on the
vpperside for the most part, or but very seldome, and reddish or purplish vnderneath,
and very seldome greener: the flowers stand vpon small foot-stalkes, and shew themselues
open for the most part, before any leaues doe appeare, being smaller and shorter
then those with Iuie leaues, and of a pale purple colour, yet sometimes deeper, hanging
downe their heads, and turning vp their leaues againe, as all others doe, but more
sweete then many other of the Autumne flowers: after the flowers are past, come the
heads turning or winding themselues downe in like manner as the other doe, hauing
such like seede, but somewhat larger, and more vneuen, or not so round at the least:
the roote is round, and not flat, of a browner colour, and not so blacke on the outside
as many of the others.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The Sowebreads of the Spring doe both grow on the Pyrenæan Mountaines
in Italy, and in Candy, and about Mompelier in France; Antioch in
Syria also hath yeelded some both of the Spring and Autumne. Those
with round and Iuie leaues grow in diuers places both of France and Italy:
and the common in Germany, and the Lowe-Countries. But that Autumne
Sowebread with white flowers, is reported to grow in the Kingdome of
Naples. I haue very curiously enquired of many, if euer they found them
in any parts of England, neare or further off from the places where they
dwell: but they haue all affirmed, that they neuer found, or euer heard of
any that haue found of any of them. This onely they haue assured, that
there groweth none in the places, where some haue reported them to grow.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>Those of the Spring doe flower about the end of Aprill, or beginning
of May. The other of the Summer, about the end of Iune or in Iuly. The
rest some in August, and September, others in October.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The Common Sowebread is called by most Writers in Latine, <i>Panis
Porcinus</i>, and by that name it is knowne in the Apothecaries shops, as also
by the name <i>Arthanita</i>, according to which name, they haue an ointment
so called, which is to be made with the iuice hereof. It is also called by diuers
other names, not pertinent for this discourse. The most vsuall name,
whereby it is knowne to most Herbarists, is <i>Cyclamen</i> (which is the Greeke
word) or as some call it <i>Cyclaminus</i> adding thereunto their other seuerall
titles. In English, Sowebread.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The leaues and rootes are very effectuall for the spleene, as the Ointment
before remembred plainly proueth, being vsed for the same purpose,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>and that to good effect. It is vsed also for women in long and hard trauels,
where there is danger, to accelerate the birth, either the roote or the leafe
being applyed. But for any amorous effects, I hold it meere fabulous.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e next tuberous rooted plants that are to follow (of right in my opinion) are
the <i>Anemones</i> or Windeflowers, and although some tuberous rooted plants,
that is, the Asphodils, Spiderworts, and Flowerdeluces haue beene before inserted,
it was, both because they were in name or forme of flowers sutable to them
whom they were ioyned vnto, and also that they should not be seuered and entreated
of in two seuerall places: the rest are now to follow, at the least so many of them as
be beautifull flowers, fit to furnish a Florists Garden, for natures delightsome varieties
and excellencies. To distinguish the Family of <i>Anemones</i> I may, that is, into the wilde
kindes, and into the tame or mannured, as they are called, and both of them noursed
vp in Gardens; and of them into those that haue broader leaues, and into those that
haue thinner or more iagged leaues: and of each of them, into those that beare single
flowers, and those that beare double flowers. But to describe the infinite (as I may so
say) variety of the colours of the flowers, and to giue to each his true distinction and
denomination, <i>Hic labor, hoc opus est</i>, it farre passeth my ability I confesse, and I thinke
would grauell the best experienced this day in Europe (and the like I said concerning
Tulipas, it being as contingent to this plant, as is before said of the Tulipa, to be without
end in yeelding varieties:) for who can see all the varieties that haue sprung from
the sowing of the seede in all places, seeing the variety of colours risen from thence, is
according to the variety of ayres &amp; grounds wherein they are sowne, skill also helping
nature in ordering them aright. For the seede of one and the same plant sowne in diuers
ayres and grounds, doe produce that variety of colours that is much differing one
from another; who then can display all the mixtures of colours in them, to set them
downe in so small a roome as this Book? Yet as I haue done (in the former part of this
Treatise) my good will, to expresse as many of each kinde haue come to my knowledge,
so if I endeauour the like in this, I hope the courteous wil accept it, and hold me
excused for the rest: otherwise, if I were or could be absolute, I should take from my self
and others the hope of future augmentation, or addition of any new, which neuer will
be wanting. To begin therefore with the wilde kinds (as they are so accounted) I shall
first entreate of the <i>Pulsatillas</i> or Pasque flowers, which are certainly kindes of wilde
<i>Anemones</i>, both in leafe and flower, as may well be discerned by them that are iudicious
(although some learned men haue not so thought, as appeareth by their writings)
the rootes of them making one speciall note of difference, from the other sorts of
wilde <i>Anemones</i>.</p>

  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulsatilla Anglica purpurea.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The purple Pasque flower.</span>
</h5>

<p>The Pasque or Passe flower which is of our owne Country, hath many leaues lying
on the ground, somewhat rough or hairie, hard in feeling, and finely cut into many
small leaues, of a darke greene colour, almost like the leaues of Carrets, but finer and
smaller, from among which rise vp naked stalkes, rough or hairie also, set about the
middle thereof with some small diuided leaues compassing them, and rising aboue
these leaues about a spanne, bearing euery one of them one pendulous flower, made of
six leaues, of a fine Violet purple colour, but somewhat deepe withall, in the middle
whereof stand many yellow threads, set about a middle purple pointell: after the
flower is past, there commeth vp in the stead thereof a bushie head of long seedes,
which are small and hoarie, hauing at the end of euery one a small haire, which is gray
likewise: the roote is small and long, growing downewards into the ground, with a
tuft of haire at the head thereof, and not lying or running vnder the vpper crust thereof,
as the other wilde <i>Anemones</i> doe.</p>

  <span class="line">The Passe flower of Denmarke.</span>
</h5>

<p>There is another that was brought out of Denmarke, very like vnto the former, but
that it is larger both in roote and leafe, and flower also, which is of a fairer purple colour,
not so deepe, and besides, will better abide to bee mannured then our English
kinde will, as my selfe haue often proued.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Viriusque flore

<p>Of both these sorts it is said, that some plants haue bin found, that haue borne white

  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulsatilla flore rubro.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The red Passe flower.</span>

<p>Lobel, as I take it, did first set forth this kinde, being brought him from Syria, the
leaues whereof are finer cut, the flower smaller, and with longer leaues, and of a red
colour.</p>

<h5 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulsatilla flore luteo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The yellow Passe flower.</span>
</h5>

<p>The yellow Passe flower hath his leaues cut and diuided, very like vnto the leaues
of the first kinde, but somewhat more hairie, greene on the vpperside, and hairie vnderneath:
the stalke is round and hoary, the middle whereof is beset with some small
leaues, as in the other, from among which riseth vp the stalke of the flower, consisting
of six leaues of a very faire yellow colour on the inside, and of a hoary pale yellow on
the outside; after which followeth such an head of hairie thrummes as in the former:
the roote is of the bignesse of a mans finger.</p>

  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulsatilla flore albo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The white Passe flower.</span>
</h5>

<p>The white Passe flower (which Clusius maketh a kinde of <i>Anemone</i>, and yet as hee
saith himselfe, doth more nearely resemble the <i>Pulsatilla</i>) hath, from amongst a tuft or
head of haires, which grow at the toppe of a long blacke roote, many leaues standing
vpon long stalkes, which are diuided as it were into three wings or parts, and each
part finely cut and diuided, like vnto the Passe flower of Denmarke, but somewhat
harder in handling, greenish on the vpperside, and somewhat gray vnderneath, and
very hairie all ouer: among these leaues rise vp the stalkes, beset at the middle of them
with three leaues, as finely cut and diuided as those belowe, from aboue which standeth
the flower, being smaller, and not so pendulous as the former, but in the like manner
consisting of six leaues, of a snow white colour on the inside, and a little browner on
the outside, with many yellow thrums in the middle: after the flower is past, riseth vp
such a like hoary head, composed as it were of many haires, each whereof hath a small
seede fastened vnto it, like as the former Passe flowers haue.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Place.</h5>

<p>The first is found in many places of England, vpon dry bankes that lye
open to the Sunne.</p>

<p>The second was first brought, as I take it, by Doctor Lobel from Denmarke,
&amp; is one of the two kinds, that Clusius saith are common in Germanie,
this bearing a paler purple flower, and more early then the other, which
is the same with our English, whose flower is so darke, that it almost seemeth
blacke.</p>

<p>The red kinde, as Lobel saith, came from Syria.</p>

<p>The yellow Passe flower, which Clusius maketh his third wilde <i>Anemone</i>,
was found very plentifully growing at the foote of St. Bernards Hill, neare
vnto the Cantons of the Switzers.</p>

<p>The white one groweth on the Alpes neare Austria, in France likewise
and other places.</p>

  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anemone Lusitanica siue hortensis latifolia flore simplici luteo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The single Garden yellow Windflower or Anemone.</span>
</h5>

<p>This single yellow Anemone or Windflower hath diuers broad round leaues, somewhat
diuided and endented withall on the edges, brownish at the first rising vp out of
the ground, and almost folded together, and after of a sad greene on the vpperside,
and reddish vnderneath; among which rise vp small slender stalkes, beset at the middle
of them with two or three leaues, more cut and diuided then those belowe, with
small yellow flowers at the toppe of them, consisting of ten or twelue leaues a peece,
hauing a few yellow threads in the middle of them, standing about a small greene
head, which in time growing ripe hath small flat seede, inclosed within a soft wooll
or downe, which is easily blowne away with the winde: the roote groweth downeward
into the ground, diuersly spread with branches here and there, of a brownish yellow
on the outside, and whitish within, so brittle, that it can hardly bee touched without
breaking.</p>

<h5 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anemone latifolia flore luteo duplici.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The double yellow Anemone or Windflower.</span>
</h5>

<p>This double yellow Anemone hath such broad round leaues as the single kinde
hath, but somewhat larger or ranker: the stalkes are beset with larger leaues, more
deeply cut in on the edges: the flowers are of a more pale yellow, with some purplish
veines on the outside, and a little round pointed; but they are all on the inside of a
faire yellow colour, consisting of two rowes of leaues, whereof the innermost is the
narrower, with a small greene head in the middle, compassed with yellow threads as
in the former: the roote is like the roote of the single; neither of these haue any good
sent, and this springeth vp and flowreth later then the single kinde.</p>

  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anemone latifolia purpurea stellata siue papaveracea.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The purple Starre Anemone or Windflower.</span>
</h5>

<p>The first leaues of this purple Anemone, which alwayes spring vp before Winter,
(if the roote be not kept too long out of the ground,) are somewhat like the leaues of
<i>Sanicle</i> or Selfe-heale, but the rest that follow are more deeply cut in and iagged; among
which rise vp diuers round stalkes, beset with iagged leaues as all other Anemones
are, aboue which leaues, the stalkes rising two or three inches high, beare one
flower a peece, composed of twelue leaues or more, narrow and pointed, of a bleake
purple or whitish ash-colour, somewhat shining on the outside, and of a fine purple colour
tending to a murrey on the inside, with many blackish blew threads or thrummes
in the middle of the flower, set about a head, whereon groweth the seede, which is
small and blacke, inclosed in soft wooll or downe, which flieth away with the winde,
carrying the seede with it, if it be not carefully gathered: the roote is blackish on the
outside, and white within, tuberous or knobby, with many fibres growing at it.</p>

<h5 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anemone purpurea Stellata altera.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Another purple Starre Anemone.</span>
</h5>

<p>There is so great diuersity in the colours of the flowers of these broad leafed kinds of
Anemones or Windflowers, that they can very hardly be expressed, although in their
leaues there is but little or no difference. I shall not neede therefore to make seuerall
descriptions of euery one that shall be set downe; but it will be sufficient, I thinke, to
giue you the distinctions of the flowers: for as I said, therein is the greatest and chiefest
difference. This other Starre Anemone differeth not from the former in leafe or
flower, but onely that this is of a more pale sullen colour on the outside, and of a paler
purple colour on the inside.</p>

rise vp one or two stalkes, (seldome more from one roote) hauing some leaues about
the middle of the stalke, as other Anemones haue, and bearing at the toppes of the
stalkes one large flower a peece, very double, whose outermost leaues being broadest,
are greenish at the first, but afterwards red, hauing sometimes some greene abiding still
in the leaues, and the red striped through it: the other leaues which are within these
are smaller, and of a perfect red colour; the innermost being smallest, are of the same
red colour but turned somewhat inward, hauing no thrummes or threads in the middle,
as the former haue, and bearing no seede: the roote is blackish on the outside, and
white within, thicke and tuberous as the other kindes, but thicker set and close together,
not shooting any long slender rootes as others doe. Some Gentlewomen call this
Anemone, The Spanish Marigold.</p>

set in two or three rowes at the most, but not so thicke or double as the last, yet seeming
to be but one thicke rowe of many small and long leaues, of an excellent red or crimson

  <span class="line">The common double red or Scarlet Anemone.</span>
</h5>

<p>The leaues of this double Anemone are very like vnto the leaues of the single Scarlet
Anemone, but not so thin cut and diuided as that with the purple flower: the flower
hereof when it first openeth it selfe, consisteth of six and sometimes of seuen or eight
broad leaues, of a deepe red, or excellent Scarlet colour, the middle head being thick
closed, and of a greenish colour, which after the flower hath stood blowne some time,
doth gather colour, and openeth it selfe into many small leaues, very thicke, of a more
pale red colour, and more Stamell like then the outer leaues: the root of this is thicke
and tuberous, very like vnto the root of the single Scarlet Anemone.</p>

<p>We haue a kinde hereof, varying neither in roote, leafe, or forme of flower from
the former, but in the colour, in that this will haue sometimes the outer broad leaues
party coloured, with whitish or blush coloured great streakes in the red leaues both inside
and outside; as also diuers of the middle or inner leaues striped in the same manner:
the roote hereof giueth fairer flowers in some yeares then in others, and sometimes
giue flowers all red againe.</p>

<p>There is small difference to be discerned, either in the roote or leaues of this from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the former double Scarlet Anemone, sauing that the leaues hereof are a little broader,
and seeme to bee of a little fresher greene colour: the flower of this is as large almost,
and as double as the former, and the inner leaues likewise almost as large as they, being
of a whitish or flesh colour at the first opening of them, but afterwards become of
a most liuely blush colour; the bottomes of the leaues abiding of a deeper blush, and
with long standing, the tops of the leaues will turne almost wholly white againe.</p>

<p>This double white Anemone differeth little from the former blush Anemone, but
in that it is smaller in all the parts thereof, and also that the flower hereof being wholly
of a pure white colour, without any shew of blush therein, hath the middle thrummes
much smaller and shorter then it, and not rising vp so high, but seeme as if they were
chipped off euen at the toppes.</p>

<p>This small double blush Anemone differeth very little from the double white last
recited, but onely in the colour of the flower: for they are both much about the bignesse
one of another, the middle thrums likewise being as small and short, and as euen
aboue, onely the flower at the first opening is almost white, but afterwards the outer
leaues haue a more shew of blush in them, and the middle part a little deeper then they.</p>

<p>This double purple Anemone is also of the same kindred with the first double red or
Scarlet Anemone for the form or doublenesse of the flower, consisting but of six or seuen
leaues at the most in this our Country, although in the hotter it hath ten or twelue,
or more as large leaues for the outer border, and as large small leaues for the inner
middle also, and almost as double, but of a deepe purple tending toward a Violet colour,
the outer leaues being not so deepe as the inner: the roote and leafe commeth
neare vnto the single purple Anemone before described, but that the roote spreadeth
not so small and so much.</p>

smalnesse of the middle thrums, and euennesse at the toppes of them, being not so large
and great a flower as the double purple, either in the inner or outer leaues, but yet is
very faire, thicke and double, and of a most liuely Carnation silke colour, very deepe,
both the outer leaues and middle thrums also so bright, that it doth as it were amaze,
and yet delight the minde of the beholder, but by long standing in the Sun, waxe a little

  <span class="line">The double purple Veluet Anemone.</span>
</h5>

<p>This double Veluet Anemone is in all things like the last described Carnation Anemone,
but somewhat larger, the difference consisteth in the colour of the flower,
which in this is of a deep or sad crimson red colour for the outer leaues and of a deep
purple Veluet colour in the middle thrums, resembling the colour of the lesser <i>Amaranthus
purpureus</i>, or Purple flower gentle hereafter described, whereof it tooke the
name, which middle thrums are as fine and small, and as euen at the toppes as the
white or last Carnation Anemones.</p>

</h5>

<p>This double Anemone also is very like the last described Anemone, but that in the
middle of the purple thrums, there thrusteth forth a tuft of threads or leaues of a more
light crimson colour.</p>

<p>And thus much for the kindes of Anemones or Windflowers, so farre forth as haue
hitherto come to our knowledge; yet I doubt not, but that more varieties haue beene
elsewhere collected, and will be also in our Countrey daily and yearly obserued by
diuers, that raise them vp from sowing the seede, wherein lyeth a pretty art, not yet familiarly
knowne to our Nation, although it be very frequent in the Lowe-Countries,
where their industry hath bred and nourished vp such diuersities and varieties, that
they haue valued some Anemones at such high rates, as most would wonder at,
and none of our Nation would purchase, as I thinke. And I doubt not, if wee would
be as curious as they, but that both our ayre and soyle would produce as great variety,
as euer hath been seene in the Lowe-Countries; which to procure, if any of our Nation
will take so much paines in sowing the seedes of Anemones, as diuers haue done of
Tulipas: I will set them downe the best directions for that purpose that I haue learned,
or could by much search and tryall attaine vnto; yet I must let them vnderstand thus
much also, that there is not so great variety of double flowers raised from the seede of
the thin leafed Anemones, as from the broad leafed ones.</p>

<p>First therefore (as I said before) concerning Tulipas, there is some speciall choice to
be made of such flowers, whose seed is fittest to be taken. Of the <i>Latifolias</i>, the double
Orenge tawney seede being sowne, yeeldeth pretty varieties, but the purples, and
reds, or crimsons, either <i>Latifolias</i> or <i>Tenuifolias</i>, yeeld small variety, but such as draw
nearest to their originall, although some be a little deeper or lighter then others. But
the light colours be they which are the chiefe for choice, as white, ash-colour, blush
or carnation, light orenge, simple or party coloured, single or double, if they beare
seede, which must bee carefully gathered, and that not before it bee thorough ripe,
which you shall know by the head; for when the seede with the wollinesse beginneth
to rise a little of it selfe at the lower end, it must bee then quickly gathered, lest the
winde carry it all away. After it is thus carefully gathered, it must be laid to dry for a
weeke or more, which then being gently rubbed with a little dry sand or earth, will
cause the seede to be somewhat better separated, although not thoroughly from the
woollinesse or downe that compasseth it.</p>

<p>Within a moneth at the most after the seede is thus gathered and prepared, it must
be sowne; for by that meanes you shall gaine a yeare in the growing, ouer that you
should doe if you sowed it in the next Spring.</p>

<p>If there remaine any woollinesse in the seede, pull it in sunder as well as you can,
and then sowe your seede reasonable thin, and not too thicke, vpon a plaine smooth
bed of fine earth, or rather in pots or tubbes, and after the sowing, sift or gently straw
ouer them some fine good fresh mould, about one fingers thicknesse at the most for the
first time: And about a moneth after their first springing vp, sift or straw ouer them
in like manner another fingers thicknesse of fine earth, and in the meane time if the
weather proue dry, you must water them gently and often, but not to ouerglut them
with moisture; and thus doing, you shall haue them spring vp before Winter, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
grow pretty strong, able to abide the sharpe Winter in their nonage, in vsing some
little care to couer them loosely with some fearne, or furse, or beane hame, or straw,
or any such, which yet must not lye close vpon them, nor too farre from them neither.</p>

<p>The next Spring after the sowing, if you will, but it is better if you stay vntill August,
you may then remoue them, and set them in order by rowes, with sufficient distance
one from another, where they may abide, vntill you see what manner of flower
each plant will beare, which you may dispose of according to your minde.</p>

<p>Many of them being thus ordered (if your mould be fine, loose, and fresh, not stonie,
clayish, or from a middin) will beare flowers the second yeare after the sowing,
and most or all of them the third yeare, if the place where you sowe them, be not annoyed
with the smoake of Brewers, Dyers, or Maultkils, which if it be, then will they
neuer thriue well.</p>

<p>Thus much haue I thought good to set downe, to incite some of our owne Nation
to be industrious; and to helpe them forward, haue giuen such rules of directions, that
I doubt not, but they will vpon the tryall and view of the variety, proceede as well in
the sowing of Anemones as of Tulipas.</p>

<p id="Chap_2_XXV_a">I cannot (Gentlewomen) withold one other secret from you, which is to informe
you how you may so order Anemones, that after all others ordinarily are past, you
may haue them in flower for two or three moneths longer then are to be seene with
any other, that vseth not this course I direct you.</p>

<p>The ordinary time to plant Anemones, is most commonly in August, which will
beare flower some peraduenture before Winter, but most vsually in February, March,
and Aprill, few or none of them abiding vntill May; but it you will keepe some roots
out of the ground vnplanted, vntill February, March, and Aprill, and plant some at
one time, and some at another, you shall haue them beare flower according to their
planting, those that shall be planted in February, will flower about the middle or end
of May, and so the rest accordingly after that manner: And thus may you haue the
pleasure of these plants out of their naturall seasons, which is not permitted to be enioyed
in any other that I know, Nature being not so prone to bee furthered by art in
other things as in this. Yet regard, that in keeping your Anemone rootes out of the
ground for this purpose, you neither keep them too dry, nor yet too moist, for sprouting
or rotting; and in planting them, that you set them not in too open a sunny place,
but where they may be somewhat shadowed.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Place.</h5>

<p>I shall not need to spend much time in relating the seuerall places of these
Anemones, but onely to declare that the most of them that haue not beene
raised from seed, haue come from Constantinople to vs; yet the first broad
leafed or yellow Anemone, was first found in Portugall, and from thence
brought into these parts. And the first purple Starre Anemone in Germanie,
yet was the same sent among others from Constantinople also. And
the first thin cut leafed Anemone came first out of Italy, although many of
that sort haue come likewise from Constantinople. And so haue the double
red or Scarlet Anemones, and the great double blush, which I first had by
the gift of <abbr title="Mister">Mʳ.</abbr> Humfrey Packington of Worcestershire Esquire, at Haruington.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Time.</h5>

<p>The times of their flowring are sufficiently expressed in the descriptions,
or in the rules for planting.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Names.</h5>

<p>The Turkish names whereby the great double broad leafed kindes haue
beene sent vnto vs, were <i>Giul Catamer</i>, and <i>Giul Catamer lale</i>; And <i>Binizade</i>,
<i>Binizante</i>, and <i>Galipoli lale</i> for the thinne cut leafed Anemones.
All Authors haue called them <i>Anemones</i>, and are the true <i>Herbæ venti</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>Wee call them in English eyther Anemones, after the Greeke name,
or Windflowers, after the Latine.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Vertues.</h5>

<p>There is little vse of these in Physicke in our dayes, eyther for inward or
outward diseases; onely the leaues are vsed in the Ointment called <i>Marciatum</i>,
which is composed of many other hot herbes, and is vsed in cold
griefes, to warme and comfort the parts. The roote, by reason of the
sharpenesse, is apt to drawe downe rheume, if it be tasted or chewed in the
mouth.</p>

And first of the Winter Wolfesbane, which for the beauty, as well as the earlinesse of
his flowers, being the first of all other, that shew themselues after Christmas, deserueth

</h4>

<p>This little plant thrusteth vp diuers leaues out of the ground, in the deepe of Winter
oftentimes, if there be any milde weather in Ianuary, but most commonly after
the deepe frosts, bearing vp many times the snow vpon the heads of the leaues, which
like vnto the Anemone, doe euery leafe rise from the roote vpon seuerall short foote-stalkes,
not aboue foure fingers high, some hauing flowers in the middle of them,
(which come vp first most vsually) and some none, which leaues stand as it were
round, the stalke rising vp vnder the middle of the leafe, deeply cut in and gashed to
the middle stalke almost, of a very faire deepe greene colour, in the middle whereof,
close vnto the leafe, standeth a small yellow flower, made of six leaues, very like a
Crowfoote, with yellow threads in the middle: after the flower is fallen, there rise vp
diuers small hornes or cods set together, wherein are contained whitish yellow round
seede. The roote is tuberous, so like both for shape and colour vnto the rootes of Anemones,
that they will easily deceiue one not well experienced, but that it is browner

<p>This Wolfesbane shooteth not out of the ground vntill the Spring be well begun,
and then it sendeth forth great broad greene leaues, deeply cut in about the edges,
not much vnlike the leaues of the great wilde Crowfoote, but much greater; from among
which leaues riseth vp a strong stiffe stalke, three foote high, hauing here and
there leaues set vpon it, like vnto the lowest, but smaller; the toppe of the stalke is diuided
into three or foure branches, whereon are set diuers pale yellow flowers, which
turne at the last to be almost white, in fashion like almost vnto the flowers of the Helmet
flower, but much smaller, and not gaping so wide open: after the flowers
are past come vp diuers short poddes, wherein is contained blacke seede: the
roote is made of a number of darke browne strings, which spread and fasten

<p>The Helmet flower hath diuers leaues of a fresh greene colour on the vpperside,
and grayish vnderneath, much spread abroad and cut into many slits and notches,
more then any of the Wolfebanes; the stalke riseth vp two or three foot high, beset to
the top with the like leaues, but smaller: the toppe is sometimes diuided into two or
three branches, but more vsually without, whereon stand many large flowers one aboue
another, in forme very like vnto a Hood or open Helmet, being composed of
fiue leaues, the vppermost of which and the greatest, is hollow, like vnto an Helmet
or Headpeece, two other small leaues are at the sides of the Helmet, closing it like
cheekes, and come somewhat vnder, and two other which are the smallest hang down
like labels, or as if a close Helmet were opened, and some peeces hung by, of a perfect
or faire blew colour, (but grow darker, hauing stood long) which causeth it be so nourished
vp in Gardens, that their flowers, as was vsuall in former times, and yet is in
many Countrey places, may be laid among greene herbes in windowes and roomes
for the Summer time: but although their beauty may be entertained for the vses aforesaid,
yet beware they come not neare your tongue or lippes, lest they tell you to your
cost, they are not so good as they seeme to be: in the middest of the flower, when it is
open and gapeth wide, are seene certaine small threads like beards, standing about a
middle head, which when the flower is past, groweth into three or foure, or more small
blackish pods, containing in them blacke seede: the rootes are brownish on the outside,
and white within, somewhat bigge and round aboue, and small downewards,
somewhat like vnto a small short Carrot roote, sometimes two being ioyned at the
head together. But the name <i>Napellus</i> anciently giuen vnto it, doth shew they referred

<p>This wholsome plant I thought good to insert, not onely for the forme of the flower,
but also for the excellent properties thereof, as you shall haue them related hereafter.
The rootes hereof are small and tuberous, round and somewhat long, ending
for the most part in a long fibre, and with some other small threads from the head
downeward: from the head whereof riseth vp diuers greene leaues, euery one seuerally
vpon a stalke, very much diuided, as finely almost as the leaues of Larkes heeles
or spurres: among which riseth vp a hard round stalke, a foote high and better, with
some such leaues thereon as grow belowe, at the toppe whereof stand many small
yellowish flowers, formed very like vnto the former whitish Wolfesbane, bearing
many blacke seedes in pods afterwards in the like manner.</p>

<p>Many more sorts of varieties of these kindes there are, but these onely, as the most
specious, are noursed vp in Florists Gardens for pleasure; the other are kept by such

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first flowreth (as is said) in Ianuary, and February, and sometimes
vntill March be well spent, and the seede soone ripe after.</p>

<p>The other three flower not vntill Iune and Iuly.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is vsually called <i>Aconitum hyemale Belgarum</i>. Lobelius, calleth it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span><i>Bulbosus vnifolius Batrachoides</i>, <i>Aconitum Elleboraceum</i>, and <i>Ranunculus Monophyllos</i>,
and some by other names. Most Herbarists call it <i>Aconitum hyemale</i>,
and we in English thereafter, Winters Wolfesbane; and of some, Yellow
Aconite.</p>

<p>The second is called by most Writers, <i>Aconitum luteum Ponticum</i>: Some
also <i>Lupicida</i>, <i>Luparia</i> and <i>Canicida</i>, of the effect in killing Wolues and
Dogs: And some, because the flower is more white then yellow, doe call
it <i>Aconitum flore albido</i>, we call it in English, The whitish yellow Aconite,
or Wolfesbane, but some after the Latine name, The yellow Wolfesbane.</p>

<p>The third is called generally <i>Napellus</i>, and <i>Verus</i>, because it is the true
<i>Napellus</i> of the ancient Writers, which they so termed from the forme of a

<p>Although the first three sorts of plants be very poisonfull and deadly, yet
there may bee very good vse made of them for sore eyes (being carefully
applyed, yet not to all sorts of sore eyes neither without discretion) if the
distilled water be dropped therein.</p>

<p>The rootes of the counterpoison Monkes hood are effectuall not onely
against the poison of the poisonfull Helmet flower, and all others of that
kinde, but also against the poison of all venemous beasts, the plague or pestilence,
and other infectious diseases, which raise spots, pockes, or markes
in the outward skinne, by expelling the poison from within, and defending
the heart as a most soueraigne Cordiall. It it vsed also with good successe
against the wormes of the belly, and against the paines of the Wind collick.</p>

tuberous or cloggy rootes; but with what iudgement, let others say, when they haue
compared the vmbels of flowers and seede of the Oenanthes, with the flowers and

the former, but out of the middle of the flower ariseth another double flower, but
smaller.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>These plants grow naturally in diuers Countries; some in France, and
Germany, and some in England, some in Spaine, Portugall, and Italy, and
some haue been sent out of Turkie from Constantinople, and some from other
parts, their titles for the most part descrying their Countries.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>Some of them flower early, as is set downe in their descriptions, or titles.
The others in Aprill and May. The white Candy Crowfoote, and
the other single and double sorts of Asia, about the same time, or somewhat
later, and one in Autumne, as it is set downe.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The names that are giuen seuerally to them may well serue this worke,
that thereby they may bee distinguished one from another: For to set
downe any further controuersie of names, how fitly or vnfitly they haue
beene called, and how variably by diuers former Writers, is fitter for a generall
History, vnto which I leaue what may be said, both concerning these
and the rest: Onely this I would giue you to vnderstand, that the Turkie
kindes haue been sent to vs vnder the names of <i>Terobolos</i> for the single, and
<i>Terobolos Catamer lale</i> for the double, and yet oftentimes, those that haue
been sent for double, haue proued single, so little fidelity is to bee found
among them.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>All or most of these plants are very sharpe and exulcerating, yet the care
and industry of diuers learned men haue found many good effects in many
of them. For the rootes and leaues both of the wilde kindes, and of some
of these of the Garden, stamped and applyed to the wrists, haue driuen away
the fits in Feuers. The roote likewise of the double English kinde is
applyed for pestilent sores, to helpe to breake them, by drawing the venome
to the place. They helpe likewise to take away scarres and markes
in diuers places of the body.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">A<span class="looks_big">s</span> an appendix to the Crowfeete, I must needes adde this plant, yet seuerally
by it selfe, because both it and his single kinde are by most adioyned thereunto,
for the neare resemblance both in shape and sharpnesse of quality. The
single kinde I leaue to the Ditch sides, and moist grounds about them, as the fittest places
for it, and onely bring the double kinde into my Garden, as fittest for his goodly
proportion and beauty to be entertained, and haue place therein.</p>

<p>The double Marsh Marigold hath many broad and round greene leaues, a little endented
about the edges, like vnto the single kinde, but not altogether so large, especially
in a Garden where it standeth not very moist: the stalkes are weake, round, hollow,
and greene, diuided into three or foure branches at the toppe, with leaues at the
seuerall ioynts, whereon stand very double flowers, of a gold yellow colour: the fiue
outer leaues being larger then any of the rest that are encompassed by them, which
fall away after they haue stood blowne a great while (for it endureth in flower a moneth
or more, especially if it stand in a shadowie place) without bearing any seed: the
rootes are composed of many thicke, long, and round whitish strings, which runne
downe deep into the ground, and there are fastened very strongly.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>This plant groweth naturally in diuers Marshes, and moist grounds in
Germany, yet in some more double then in others; it hath long agoe
beene cherished in our Gardens.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>It flowreth in Aprill or May, as the yeare proueth earlier or later: all
his leaues doe in a manner quite perish in Winter, and spring anew in the
end of February, or thereabouts.</p>

<p>There is great controuersie among the learned about the single kinde,
but thereof I shall not neede to speake in this place; if God permit I
may in a fitter. This is called generally in Latine, <i>Caltha palustris multiplex</i>,
or <i>flore pleno</i>. And wee in English (after the Latine, which take
<i>Caltha</i> to be that which wee vsually call <i>Calendula</i>, a Marigold) The double
Marsh Marigold.</p>

with them, seeming to be small Crowfeete in all their parts, but of another
and more wholsome kinde. Their diuersity among themselues consisteth
chiefly in the colour of the flowers, all of them being single, except one which is very
thicke and double.</p>

  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hepatica flore cæruleo simplici maior.</i></span>

<p>The flowers of this Hepatica doe spring vp, blow open, and sometimes shed and
fall away, before any leaues appeare or spread open. The rootes are composed of a
bush of blackish things, from the seuerall heads or buttons whereof, after the flowers
are risen and blowne, arise many fresh greene leaues, each seuerally standing vpon
his foot-stalke, folded together, and somewhat browne and hairy at their first comming,
which after are broad, and diuided at the edges into three parts: the flowers
likewise stand euery one vpon his owne seuerall foote-stalke, of the same height with
the leaues for the most part, which is about foure or fiue fingers breadth high, made of
six leaues most vsually, but sometimes it will haue seuen or eight, of a faire blew colour,
with many white chiues or threads in the middle, standing about a middle green
head or vmbone, which after the flower is fallen groweth greater, and sheweth many
small graines or seede set close together (with three small greene leaues compassing
them vnderneath, as they did the flower at the bottome) very like the head of seed of

<p>The leaues of this Hepatica are smaller by the halfe then the former, and grow
more aboundantly, or bushing thicke together: the flowers (when it sheweth them,
for I haue had the plant halfe a score yeares, and yet neuer saw it beare flower aboue

with a pale reddish colour, which adde a great beauty to the flowers.</p>

that the leaues are larger, and stand vpon longer foote-stalkes, and that the flowers are
small buttons, but very thicke of leaues, and as double as a flower can be, like vnto the
double white Crowfoote before described, but not so bigge, of a deepe blew or purple
colour, without any threads or head in the middle, which fall away without giuing

<p>In the colour of this flower, consisteth the chiefest difference from the last, except one
may say it is a little lesse in the bignesse of the flower, but not in doublenesse of leaues.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>All these plants with single flowers grow naturally in the Woods, and
shadowie Mountaines of Germany in many places, and some of them in
Italy also. The double kinde likewise hath been sent from Alphonsus Pantius
out of Italy, as Clusius reporteth, and was also found in the Woods,
neare the Castle of Starnbeg in Austria, the Lady Heusenstains possession,
as the same Clusius reporteth also.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>These plants doe flower very early, and are of the first flowers that shew
themselues presently after the deepe frosts in Ianuary, so that next vnto the
Winter Wolfesbane, these making their pride appeare in Winter, are the
more welcome early guests. The double kinde flowreth not altogether so
early, but sheweth his flower, and abideth when the others are past.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>They haue obtained diuers names; some calling them <i>Hepatica</i>, <i>Hepatica
nobilis</i>, <i>Hepaticum trifolium</i>, <i>Trifolium nobile</i>, <i>Trifolium aureum</i>, and some <i>Trinitas</i>,
and <i>Herba Trinitatis</i>. In English you may call them either Hepatica,
after the Latine name, as most doe, or Noble Liuerwort, which you please.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>These are thought to coole and strengthen the liuer, the name importing
as much; but I neuer saw any great vse of them by any the Physitians of our
London Colledge, or effect by them that haue vsed them in Physicke in our
Country.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>All these Cranes bils doe for the most part flower in Aprill, and May,
and vntill the middle of Iune. The variable or stript Cranes bill is vsually
the latest of all the rest.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is vsually called <i>Geranium tuberosum</i>, of some <i>Geranium bulbosum</i>,
of the likenesse of the roote vnto a bulbe: It is without controuersie <i>Geranium
primum</i> of Dioscorides. The second is called <i>Geranium Gratia Dei</i>, of
others, <i>Geranium cæruleum</i>. The blew Cranes bill Lobel calleth it <i>Batrachoides</i>,
because both leafe and flower are like vnto a Crowfoote; and the affinity
with the Cranes bils in the seede causeth it rather to be referred to
them then to the Crowfeete. The stript Cranes bill is called by some <i>Geranium
Romanum</i>. The last sauing one is called <i>Geranium Hæmatodes</i>, or
<i>Sanguineum</i>, of Lobel <i>Geranium Gruinale Hæmatodes supinum radice repente</i>.
In English it may be called after the Greek and Latine, The bloudy Cranes
bill, but I rather call it, The Rose Cranes bill, because the flowers are as
large as single Roses, or as the Rose Campion. Some of them are called in
many places of England Bassinets.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>All the kindes of Cranes bils are accounted great wound herbes, and effectuall
to stay bleedings, yet some more than others. The Emperickes of
Germanie, as Camerarius saith, extoll it wonderfully, for a singular remedie
against the Stone, both in the reines and bladder.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">H<span class="looks_big">a</span>uing long debated with my selfe, where to place this &amp; the other plants that
follow in the <a href="#Chap_2_XXXII" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 32">two next Chapters</a>, I haue thought it not amisse for this worke
to set them downe here, both before the Beares eares, which are kindes of
Sanicle, as the best Authors doe hold, and after the Cranes bils, both for some qualities
somewhat resembling them, and for some affinity of the flowers with the former.</p>

<p>The spotted Sanicle hath many small round leaues, bluntly endented about the
edges, somewhat like vnto the leaues of our white Saxifrage, of a full greene colour
aboue, and whitish hairy, and somewhat reddish withall vnderneath: the stalkes are
set here and there with the like leaues, rising a foote and a halfe high or more, very
much diuided at the toppe into sundry small branches, bearing many very small white
flowers, consisting of fiue small leaues, wherein are many small red spots to be seene,
as small as pins points, of a pretty sweete sent, almost like Hawthorne flowers, in the
middle whereof are many small threads compassing a head, which when it is ripe containeth
small blacke seede: the roote is scaly, or couered with a chaffie matter, hauing
many small white fibres vnderneath, whereby it is fastened in the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Minor non guttata.</i></div>

<p>There is another of this kinde, like both in roote, leafe, and flower to the former,
the onely difference is, that this is lesser then the former, and hath no spots in the
flower, as the other hath.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Minus guttata.</i></div>

<p>We haue also another smaller kinde then the last, both in leafe and flower, the leaues
whereof are smaller, but rounder, and more finely snipt or indented about the edges,
like the teeth of a fine sawe: the stalke is little aboue a span high, hauing many small
white flowers spotted as the first, but with fewer spots.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>These growe in the shadowie Woods of the Alpes, in diuers places, and
with vs they more delight in the shade then the sunne.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>All these Sanicles doe flower in May, and continue flowring vntill Iune,
and the seede soone ripeneth after: the rootes abide all the Winter, with
some leaues on them, springing a fresh in the beginning of the yeare.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The former two are called by Clusius <i>Sanicula montana</i>, and by others
<i>Sanicula guttata</i>: by Lobel <i>Geum Alpinum</i>. The third or last hath been sent
vs vnder the name of <i>Sanicula montana altera minor</i>.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The name imposed on these plants doe certainly assure vs of their vertues,
from the first founders, that they are great healers, and from their
taste, that they are great binders.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>is spotted Nauelwort, as many doe call it, hath many thicke small leaues,
not so broad as long, of a whitish greene colour, lying on the ground in circles,

the middle whereof sometimes (for it doth not flower euery yeare in many places) ariseth
vp a stalke, scarce a foote high, beset with such like leaues as are belowe, but somewhat
longer: from the middle of the stalke vp to the top it brancheth forth diuersly,
with a leafe at euery ioynt, bearing three or foure flowers on euery branch, consisting
of fiue white leaues, spotted with small red spots, like vnto the spotted Sanicle, but
with fewer and greater spots, hauing a yellowish circle or eye in the bottome of euery
flower, and many whitish threads with yellowish tips in it: the seede is small and
blacke, contained in small round heads: the roote is small, long, and threadie, shooting
out such heads of leaues, which abide all the Winter, those that beare flower perishing.</p>

these: It hath shorter leaues then the former, and dented about the edges in the like

sharper pointed then eyther of the former, somewhat reddish also, and not dented about
the edges, but yet a little rough in handling: the stalke ariseth from among the
leaues, being somewhat reddish, and the leaues thereon are reddish pointed, diuided
at the toppe into many branches, with diuers flowers thereon, made of twelue small
long leaues, standing like a starre, of a reddish purple colour, with many threads therein,
set about the middle head, which is diuided at the toppe into many small ends, like
pods or hornes, containing therein very small seede: the roote is small like the former.</p>

leaues then any of the former, of a sadder greene colour, somewhat vneuenly endented
about the edges, and not so close set together, but spreading forth into seuerall
heads like as the former sorts doe, although not so plentifully; from the middle of
diuers of which heads rise vp brownish or reddish stalkes, set with smaller leaues thereon
to the middle thereof, and then brancheth forth into seuerall sprigs, set with diuers
small reddish flowers consisting of fiue leaues a peece, the innerside of which are of a
pale red, somewhat whitish, spotted with many small bloud red spots, as small almost
as pins points, with some small threads in the middle, standing about a small greene
head, which turneth into the seede vessell, parted foure wayes at the head, wherein
is contained small blackish seede: the rootes are small threads, which spread vnder
the ground, and shoote vp seuerall heads round about it.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>All these growe in Germany, Hungarie, Austria, the Alpes, and other
such like places, where they cleaue to the rocke it selfe, that hath but a crust

vulgare maius</i>, Our common Houseleeke, by the consent of the best moderne
Writers, is the true <i>Cotyledon altera</i> of Dioscorides, or <i>Vmbilicus
Veneris alter</i>. I hold it rather to bee a kinde of small Houseleeke, as
the other two likewise are. The second is called by some <i>Aizoum</i> or <i>Sedum
minus serratum</i>. The third hath his name in his title. Wee doe call
them Nauelworts in English rather then Houseleekes, <i>Euphoniæ gratia</i>. The
last may be called dented Sengreene with reddish spotted flowers, but some
of our English Gentlewomen haue called it, The Princes Feather, which although
it be but a by-name, may well serve for this plant to distinguish it,
and whereby to be knowne.</p>

which because they doe somewhat resemble the leaues of <i>Soldanella marina</i>, which is
the Sea Bindweede, tooke the name thereof: the stalkes are slender, small, round, and
reddish, about a span high, bearing foure or fiue flowers at the toppe, euery one hanging
downe their heads, like vnto a Bell flower, consisting but of one leafe (as most of
the Bindweeds doe) plated into fiue folds, each of them ending in a long point, which
maketh the flower seem to haue fiue leaues, each whereof is deeply cut in on the edges,
and hauing a round greene head in the middle, with a pricke or pointell at the end

a pale whitish colour, tending to yellow at the first opening of the flower, which after
two or three dayes change into a faire white colour, and so continue all the while it

which therefore we call a blush colour, the edges of the flower being tipt with a little
deeper shew of that purple colour, the bottome of the flower, abiding wholly yellow,
without any circle, and is of very great beauty, which hath caused me to place it in the
forefront of the variable coloured Beares eares. And although some might thinke it
should be placed among the first ranke of Beares eares, because it is of a blush colour,
yet seeing it is assuredly gained from some of the yellow kindes by sowing the seede,
as many other sorts are, as may be seene plainly in the ground of the flower, which is

more closed then the former, hauing purplish edges, especially after they haue stood

<p>Many other varieties are to be found, with those that are curious conseruers of these
delights of nature, either naturally growing on the mountaines in seuerall places,
from whence they (being searched out by diuers) haue been taken and brought, or else
raised from the seede of some of them, as it is more probable: for seuerall varieties
haue beene obserued (and no doubt many of these before specified) to bee gotten by
sowing of the seedes, euery yeare lightly shewing a diuersity, not obserued before, either
in the leafe, diuers from that from whence it was taken, or in the flowers. I haue
onely set downe those that haue come vnder mine owne view, and not any by relation,
euen as I doe with all or most of the things contained in this worke.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Place.</h5>

<p>Many of these goodly plants growe naturally on mountaines, especially
the Alpes, in diuers places; for some kindes that growe in some places, doe
not in others, but farre distant one from the other. There hath likewise
some beene found on the Pyrenæan mountaines, but that kinde with the
blew flower and Borage leafe, hath beene gathered on the mountaines in
Spaine, and on the Pyrenæans next vnto Spaine.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Time.</h5>

<p>They all flower in Aprill and May, and the seede is ripe in the end of
Iune, or beginning of Iuly, and sometimes they will flower againe in the
end of Summer, or in Autumne, if the yeare proue temperate, moist, and
rainie.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Names.</h5>

<p>It is very probable, that none of these plants were euer knowne vnto the
ancient Writers, because we cannot be assured, that they may be truely referred
vnto any plant that they name, vnlesse we beleeue Fabius Columna,
that it should be <i>Alisma</i> of Dioscorides, for thereunto hee doth referre it.
Diuers of the later Writers haue giuen vnto them diuers names, euery one
according to his owne conceit. For Gesner calleth it <i>Lunaria arthritica</i>,
and <i>Paralytica Alpina</i>. Matthiolus accounteth it to bee of the kindred of the
Sanicles, and saith, that in his time it was called by diuers Herbarists, <i>Auricula
Vrsi</i>, which name hath since bin receiued as most vsuall. We in English
call them Beares eares, according to the Latine, or as they are called by diuers
women, French Cowslips; they may be called Mountaine Cowslips,
if you will, for to distinguish betweene them and other Cowslips, whereof
these are seuerall kindes.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sanicula Alpina siue Cortusa Matthioli.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Beares eare Sanicle.</span>
</h4>

<p>I cannot chuse but insert this delicate plant in the end of the Beares eares, for that it
is of so neare affinity, although it differ much in the forme of the leaues, the description
whereof is in this manner: The leaues that spring vp first are much crumpled, and
as it were folded together, which afterwards open themselues into faire, broad, and
roundish leaues, somewhat rough or hairy, not onely cut into fine diuisions, but somewhat
notched also about the edges, of a darke greene colour on the vpperside, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
more whitish greene vnderneath; amongst these leaues riseth vp one or two naked
round stalkes, fiue or six inches high, bearing at the toppes diuers small flowers, somewhat
sweete, like vnto the first purple Beares eare, hanging downe their heads, consisting
of fiue small pointed leaues a peece, of a darke reddish purple colour, with a
white circle or bottome in the middle, and some small threads therein: after the flowers
are past, there come small round heads, somewhat longer then any of the Beares
eares, standing vpright vpon their small foot-stalkes, wherein is contained small round
and blackish seede: the roote consisteth of a thicke tuft of small whitish threads, rather
then rootes, much enterlaced one among another: the leaues of this plant dye
downe euery yeare, and spring vp a new in the beginning of the yeare, whereas all the
Beares eares doe hold their leaues greene all the Winter, especially the middlemost,
which stand like a close head, the outermost for the most part perishing after seed time.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Place.</h5>

<p>This groweth in many shadowie Woods both of Italy and Germany;
for both Clusius hath described it, finding it in the Woods of Austria and
Stiria; and Matthiolus setteth it downe, hauing receiued it from Anthonius
Cortusus, who was President of the Garden at Padua, and found it in the
woody mountaines of Vicenza, neare vnto Villestagna; whereon (as Matthiolus
saith) there is found both with white flowers as well as with blew,
but such with white flowers or blew we neuer could see or heare further of.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Time.</h5>

<p>It flowreth much about the time of the Beares eares; or rather a little later,
and the seede is ripe with them.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Names.</h5>

<p>Clusius calleth it <i>Sanicula montana</i>, and <i>Sanicula Alpina</i>, and referreth it
to the <i>Auricula Vrsi</i>, or Beares eare, which it doth most nearly resemble:
but Matthiolus referreth it to the <i>Cariophyllata</i> or <i>Auens</i>, making it to be of
that tribe or family, and calleth it <i>Cortusa</i> of him that first sent it him. Wee
may call it eyther <i>Cortusa</i>, as for the most part all Herbarists doe, or Beares
eare Sanicle as Gerrard doth.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>All the sorts of Beares eares are Cephalicall, that is, conducing helpe for
the paines in the head, and for the giddinesse thereof, which may happen,
eyther by the sight of steepe places subiect to danger, or otherwise. They
are accounted also to be helping for the Palsey, and shaking of the ioynts;
and also as a Sanicle or wound-herbe. The leaues of the <i>Cortusa</i> taste a little
hot, and if one of them bee laide whole, without bruising, on the
cheeke of any tender skind woman, it will raise an orient red colour, as if
some <i>fucus</i> had beene laide thereon, which will passe away without any
manner of harme, or marke where it lay: This is Cortusus his obseruation
Camerarius in his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Hortus Medicus</i></cite> saith, that an oyle is made thereof,
that is admirable for to cure wounds.</p>

often furnished into diuers Countries, to their good content: And that I
may set them downe in some methodicall manner, as I haue done other things, I will
first set downe all the sorts of those we call Primroses, both single and double, and afterwards
the Cowslips with their diuersities, in as ample manner as my knowledge
can direct me. And yet I know, that the name of <i>Primula veris</i> or Primrose, is indifferently
conferred vpon those that I distinguish for <i>Paralyses</i> or Cowslips. I doe therefore
for your better vnderstanding of my distinction betweene Primroses and Cowslips,
call those onely Primroses that carry but one flower vpon a stalke, be they single
or double, except that of Master Hesket, and that with double flowers many vpon a
stalke, set out in <cite>Gerards Herball</cite>, which is his onely, not found (as I thinke) <i>in rerum
natura</i>, I am sure, such a one I could neuer heare of: And those Cowslips, that beare
many flowers vpon a stalke together constantly, be they single or double also. I might
otherwise distinguish them also by the leafe; that all the Primroses beare their long
and large broad yellowish greene leaues, without stalkes most vsually; and all the
Cowslips haue small stalkes vnder the leaues, which are smaller, and of a darker
greene, as vsually, but that this distinction is neither so certaine and generall, nor so

further relation thereof: But we haue a kinde hereof which is somewhat smaller, and
beareth milke white flowers, without any shew of yellownesse in them, and is more
vsually brought into Gardens for the rarity, and differeth not from the wilde or ordinary

but smaller, and of a sadder greene colour: the flowers stand seuerally vpon long

of the same, or very neare the same yellowish greene colour that the huske is of, so that
at the first opening, the huske and the flower seeme to make one double greene flower,
which afterwards separating themselues, the single flower groweth aboue the huske,
and spreadeth it selfe open much more then any other single Primrose doth, growing

<p>The leaues of this differ in a manner nothing from the former, neither doth the

the one cannot be knowne from the other vntill it come to flower, and then it beareth
vpon euery stalke a double green flower, of a little deeper green colour then the flower
of the former single kinde consisting but of two rowes of short leaues most vsually,

<p>Master Heskets double Primrose is very like vnto the small double Primrose,
both in leafe, roote, and height of growing, the stalke not rising much higher then it,
but bearing flowers in a farre different manner; for this beareth not only single flowers
vpon seuerall stalkes, but sometimes two or three single flowers vpon one stalk, and also
at the same time a bigger stalke, and somewhat higher, hauing one greene huske at the
toppe thereof, sometimes broken on the one side, and sometimes whole, in the middle
whereof standeth sometimes diuers single flowers, thrust together, euery flower to be
seene in his proper forme, and sometimes there appeare with some whole flowers others
that are but parts of flowers, as if the flowers were broken in peeces, and thrust
into one huske, the leaues of the flowers (being of a white or pale Primrose Colour,
but a little deeper) seldome rising aboue the height of the very huske it selfe; and
sometimes, as I haue obserued in this plant, it will haue vpon the same stalke, that beareth
such flowers as I haue here described vnto you, a small flower or two, making the
stalke seeme branched into many flowers, whereby you may perceiue, that it will vary
into many formes, not abiding constant in any yeare, as all the other sorts doe.</p>

larger, because it growth in gardens: the flowers doe stand euery one seuerally

  <span class="line">The single greene Cowslip.</span>

<p>There is little difference in leafe or roote of this from the first Cowslip, the chiefest
varietie in this kinde is this, that the leaues are somewhat greener, and the flowers being
in all respects like in forme vnto the first kinde, but somewhat larger, are of
the same colour with the greene huskes, or rather a little yellower, and of a very
small sent; in all other things I finde no diuersitie, but that it standeth much longer in
flower before it fadeth, especially if it stand out of the Sunne.</p>

<p>There is another kinde, whose flowers are folded or crumpled at the edges, and the

as it were ribbes, and crumpled on the sides of the huskes, which doe somewhat

<p>This kinde of Cowslip hath leaues much like the ordinary kinde, but somewhat
smaller: the flowers are yellow like the Cowslip, but smaller, standing many vpon

<p>This little Cowslippe (which will hardly endure in our gardens, for all the care and
industrie we can vse to keepe it) hath all the Winter long, and vntill the Spring begin
to come on, his leaues so closed together, that it seemeth a small white head of leaues,
which afterwards opening it selfe, spreadeth round vpon the ground, and hath small
long and narrow leaues, snipt about the edges, of a pale greene colour on the vpperside,
&amp; very white or mealy vnderneath, among these leaues rise vp one or two stalks,
small &amp; hoary, halfe a foot high, bearing at the top a bush or tuft of much smaller flowers,
standing vpon short foot stalkes, somewhat like vnto Cowslips, but more like vnto
the Beares eares, of a fine reddish purple colour, in some deeper, in others paler, with a
yellowish circle in the bottomes of the flowers, like vnto many of the Beares eares, of
a faint or small sent: the seede is smaller than in any of the former kindes, and so are
the rootes likewise, being small, white and threddy.</p>

<p>This kinde differeth very little or nothing from the former, sauing that it seemeth
a little larger both in leafe and flower, and that the flowers hereof are wholly white,
without any great appearance of any circle in the bottome of them, vnlesse it be well
obserued, or at least being nothing so conspicuous, as in the former.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flore geminato.</i></div>

<p>The double Paigle or Cowslip hath smaller and darker greene leaues then the single

flowers vpon a stalke, but not so many as the single kinde, euery one whereof is of a
deeper and fairer yellow colour then any of the former, standing not much aboue the
brimmes of the huskes that hold them, consisting of two or three rowes of leaues set

<p>This double greene Cowslip is so like vnto the single greene kinde formerly expressed,
that vntill they be neare flowring, they can hardly be distinguished; but when

<p>There is small difference in the leaues of this double kinde from the last, but that
they are not of so darke a greene: the chiefest difference consisteth in the flowers,
which are many, standing together at the toppes of the stalkes, but farre differing from
all other of these kindes: for euery flower standing vpon his owne stalke, is composed
of many very small and narrow leaues, without any huske to containe them, but
spreading open like a little Rose, of a pale yellowish greene colour, and without any
sent at all, abiding in flower, especially if it stand in a shadowie place out of the sunne,
aboue two moneths, almost in as perfect beauty, as in the first weeke.</p>

<p>All those kindes as they haue been found wilde, growing in diuers places<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
in England, so they haue been transplanted into Gardens, to be there nourished
for the delight of their louers, where they all abide, and grow fairer
then in their naturall places, except the small Birds eyes, which will (as I
said) hardly abide any culture, but groweth plentifully in all the North
Countries, in their squally or wet grounds.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>These doe all flower in the Spring of the yeare, some earlier and some
later, and some in the midst of Winter, as they are defended from the colds
and frosts, and the mildnesse of the time will permit; yet the Cowslips doe
alwayes flower later then the Primroses, and both the single and double
greene Cowslips latest, as I said in their descriptions, and abide much after
all the rest.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>All these plants are called most vsually in Latine, <i>Primulæ veris</i>, <i>Primulæ
pratenses</i>, and <i>Primulæ siluarum</i>, because they shew by their flowring the new
Spring to bee comming on, they being as it were the first Embassadours
thereof. They haue also diuers other names, as <i>Herba Paralysis</i>, <i>Arthritica</i>,
<i>Herba Sancti Petri</i>, <i>Claues Sancti Petri</i>, <i>Verbasculum odoratum</i>, <i>Lunaria arthritica</i>,
<i>Phlomis</i>, <i>Alisma siluarum</i>, and <i>Alismatis alterum genus</i>, as Fabius Columna
calleth them. The Birds eyes are called of Lobel in Latine, <i>Paralytica
Alpina</i>, <i>Sanicula angustifolia</i>, making a greater and a lesser. Others call
them <i>Sanicula angustifolia</i>, but generally they are called <i>Primula veris minor</i>.
I haue (as you see) placed them with the Cowslips, putting a difference betweene
Primroses and Cowslips. And some haue distinguished them, by
calling the Cowslips, <i>Primula veris Elatior</i>, that is, the Taller Primrose, and
the other <i>Humilis</i>, Lowe or Dwarfe Primroses. In English they haue in like
manner diuers names, according to seuerall Countries, as Primroses, Cowslips,
Oxelips, Palsieworts, and Petty Mulleins. The first kindes, which are
lower then the rest, are generally called by the name of Primroses (as I
thinke) throughout England. The others are diuersly named; for in some
Countries they call them Paigles or Palsieworts, or Petty Mulleins, which
are called Cowslips in others. Those are vsually called Oxelips, whose
flowers are naked, or bare without huskes to containe them, being not so
sweete as the Cowslip, yet haue they some little sent, although the Latine
name doth make them to haue none. The Franticke, Fantasticke, or Foolish
Cowslip, in some places is called by Country people, Iacke an Apes on
horse-backe, which is an vsuall name with them, giuen to many other
plants, as Daisies, Marigolds, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> if they be strange or fantasticall, differing
in the forme from the ordinary kinde of the single ones. The smallest
are vsually called through all the North Country, Birds eyen, because of
the small yellow circle in the bottomes of the flowers, resembling the eye
of a bird.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>Primroses and Cowslips are in a manner wholly vsed in Cephalicall diseases,
either among other herbes or flowers, or of themselues alone, to ease
paines in the head, and is accounted next vnto Betony, the best for that purpose.
Experience likewise hath shewed that they are profitable both for
the Palsie, and paines of the ioynts, euen as the Beares eares are, which
hath caused the name of <i>Arthritica</i>, <i>Paralysis</i>, and <i>Paralytica</i> to bee giuen
them. The iuice of the flowers is commended to cleanse the spots or marks
of the face, whereof some Gentlewomen haue found good experience.</p>

willing to giue them place here, then thrust them into obscurity, and take such of their
tribe with them also as may fit for this place, either for beauty or rarity.</p>

<p>The Garden Buglosse and Borage are so well knowne vnto all, that I shall (I doubt)
but spend time in waste to describe them; yet not vsing to passe ouer any thing I name
and appropriate to this Garden so sleightly, they are thus to bee knowne: Buglosse
hath many long, narrow, hairy, or rough sad greene leaues, among which rise vp two
or three very high stalks, branched at the top, whereon stand many blew flowers, consisting
of fiue small round pointed leaues, with a small pointell in the middle, which are
very smooth, shining, and of a reddish purple while they are buds, and not blowne open,
which being fallen, there groweth in the greene huske, wherein the flower stood,
three or foure roundish blacke seedes, hauing that thread or pointell standing still in the
middle of them: the roote is blacke without, and whitish within, long, thicke, and
full of slimie iuice (as the leaues are also) and perisheth not euery yeare, as the roote of

hereof are not so high, but branched into many parts, whereon stand larger flowers,
and more pointed at the end then Buglosse, and of a paler blew colour for the most
part (yet sometimes the flowers are reddish, and sometimes pure white) each of the
flowers consisting of fiue leaues, standing in a round hairy whitish huske, diuided

and whitish) among these leaues riseth vp a stalke, spread at the toppe into many branches,
whereon stand the flowers in tufts, like vnto the Garden Buglosse, or rather
Comfrey, but lesser; in some plants of a reddish blew colour, and in others more red
or purplish, and in others of a yellowish colour: after which come the seedes, very
like vnto Buglosse, but somewhat longer and paler: the roote of most of them being
transplanted, are somewhat blackish on the outside, vntill the later end of Summer,
and then become more red: for those that grow wilde, will be then so red, that
they will giue a very deepe red colour to those that handle them, which being dryed
keepe that red colour, which is vsed to many purposes; the roote within being white,

<p>This Limonium (which I referre here to the kindes of Buglosse, presuming it is
the fittest place where to insert it) hath many long narrow, and somewhat rough leaues
lying vpon the ground, waued or cut in on both sides, like an Indenture, somewhat like
the leaues of Ceterach or Miltwast, among which rise vp two or three stalkes, somewhat
rough also, and with thin skinnes like wings, indented on both sides thereof also,
like the leaues, hauing three small, long, rough, and three square leaues at euery ioynt,
where it brancheth forth; at the toppe whereof stand many flowers vpon their foote
stalkes, in such a manner, as is not seene in any other plant, that I know; for although
that some of the small winged foot stalkes are shorter, and some longer, standing as it
were flatwise, or all on one side, and not round like an vmbell, yet are they euen at the
toppe, and not one higher than another; each of which small foote stalkes doe beare
foure or fiue greenish heads or huskes, ioyned together, out of each of which doe arise
other pale or bleake blew stiffe huskes, as if they were flowers, made as it were of
parchment, which hold their colour after they are dry a long time; and out of these
huskes likewise, doe come (at seuerall times one after another, and not all at one time
or together) white flowers, consisting of fiue small round leaues, with some white
threds in the middle: after these flowers are past, there come in their places small long
seede, inclosed in many huskes, many of those heads being idle, not yeelding any
goode seede, but chaffe, especially in out Countrey, for the want of sufficient heate of
the Sunne, as I take it: the roote is small, long, and blackish on the outside, and perisheth
at the first approach of Winter.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>Borage and Buglosse grow onely in Gardens with vs, and so doth the
<i>Semper virens</i>, his originall being vnknowne vnto vs. Alkanet or Sea Buglosse
groweth neare the Sea, in many places of France, and Spaine, and
some of the kindes also in England. But the Limonium or Marshe Buglosse
groweth in Cales, and Malacca in Spaine, and is found also in Syria, as
Rauwolfius relateth: and in other places also no doubt; for it hath beene
sent vs out of Italie, many yeares before eyther Guillaume Boel found it in
Cales, or Clusius in Malacca.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>Borage and Buglosse doe flower in Iune, and Iuly, and sometimes sooner,
and so doth the euer-liuing or neuer-dying Borage, but not as Gerrard saith,
flowring Winter and Summer, whereupon it should take his name, but leaueth
flowring in Autumne, and abideth greene with his leaues all the Winter,
flowring the next Spring following. The other flower not vntill Iuly,
and so continue, especially the Marshe Buglosse vntill September bee well
spent, and then giueth seede, if early frosts ouertake it not; for it seldome
commeth to be ripe.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>Our ordinary Borage by the consent of all the best moderne Writers, is
the true <i>Buglossum</i> of Dioscorides, and that our Buglosse was vnknowne to
the ancients. The <i>Borago semper virens</i>, Lobel calleth <i>Buglossum semper virens</i>,
that is, Euer-liuing, or Greene Buglosse: but it more resembleth Borage
then Buglosse; yet because Buglosse abideth greene, to auoyde that
there should not be two <i>Buglossa semper virentia</i>, I had rather call it Borage
then Buglosse. Anchusa hath diuers names, as Dioscorides setteth downe.
And some doe call it <i>Fucus herba</i>, from the Greeke word, because the roote
giuing so deepe a colour, was vsed to dye or paint the skinne. Others call it
<i>Buglossum Hispanicum</i>, in English Alkanet, and of some Orchanet, after the
French. Limonium was found by Leonhartus Rauwolfius, neere vnto Ioppa,
which he setteth downe in <cite>the second Chapter of the third booke of
his trauayles</cite>, and from him first knowne to these parts: I haue, as you see,
referred it to the kindes of Buglosse, for that the flowers haue some resemblance
vnto them, although I know that <i>Limonium genuinum</i> is referred to
the Beetes. Let it therefore here finde a place of residence, vntill you or I
can finde a fitter; and call it as you thinke best, eyther Limonium as Rauwolfius
doth, or Marshe Buglosse as I doe, or if you can adde a more proper
name, I shall not be offended.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>Borage and Buglosse are held to bee both temperate herbes, beeing vsed
both in the pot and in drinkes that are cordiall, especially the flowers, which
of Gentlewomen are candid for comfitts. The Alkanet is drying, and held
to be good for wounds, and if a peece of the roote be put into a little oyle
of Peter or Petroleum, it giueth as deepe a colour to the oyle, as the Hypericon
doth or can to his oyle, and accounted to be singular good for a cut or
greene wound.</p>

<p>The Limonium hath no vse that wee know, more then for a Garden; yet
as Rauwolfius saith, the Syrians vse the leaues as sallats at the Table.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere bee diuers sorts of Campions, as well tame as wilde, and although some
of them that I shall here entreate of, may peraduenture be found wilde in our
owne Countrey, yet in regard of their beautifull flowers, they are to bee respected,
and noursed vp with the rest, to furnish a garden of pleasure; as for the wilde
kindes, I will leaue them for another discourse.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lychnis Coronaria rubra simplex.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The single red Rose Campion.</span>
</h4>

<p>The single red Rose Campion hath diuers thicke, hoary, or woolly long greene
leaues, abiding greene all the winter, and in the end of the spring or beginning of summer,
shooteth forth two or three hard round woolly stalkes, with some ioynts thereon,
and at euery ioynt two such like hoary greene leaues as those below, but smaller,
diuersly branched at the toppe, hauing one flower vpon each seuerall long foot stalke,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
consisting of fiue leaues, somewhat broade and round pointed, of a perfect red crimson
colour, standing out of a hard long round huske, ridged or crested in foure or fiue
places; after the flowers are fallen there come vp round hard heads, wherein is contained
small blackish seed: the roote is small, long and wooddy, with many fibres annexed
vnto it, and shooteth forth anew oftentimes, yet perisheth often also.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lychnis Coronaria alba simplex.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The white Rose Campion.</span>
</h4>

<p>The white Rose Campion is in all things like the red, but in the colour of the flower,
which in this is of a pure white colour.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lychnis Coronaria albescens siue incarnata maculata &amp; non maculata.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The blush Rose Campion spotted and not spotted.</span>
</h4>

<p>Like vnto the former also are these other sorts, hauing no other difference to distinguish
them, but the flowers, which are of a pale or bleake whitish blush colour, especially
about the brims, as if a very little red were mixed with a great deale of white,
the middle of the flower being more white; the one being spotted all ouer the flower,
with small spots and streakes, the other not hauing any spot at all.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lychnis Coronaria rubra multiplex.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The double red Rose Campion.</span>
</h4>

<p>The double red Rose Campion is in all respects like vnto the single red kinde, but
that this beareth double flowers, consisting of two or three rowes of leaues at the
most, which are not so large as the single, and the whole plant is more tender, that is,
more apt to perish, then any of the single kindes.</p>



<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lychnis Chalcedonica flore simplici miniato.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Single Nonesuch,</span>
  <span class="line_split">or Flower of Bristow, or Constantinople.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Campion of Constantinople hath many broad and long greene leaues, among
which rise vp sundry stiffe round hairy ioynted stalks three foot high, with two leaues
euery ioynt: the flowers stand at the toppes of them, very many together, in a large
tuft or vmbell, consisting of fiue small long leaues, broade pointed, and notched-in
in the middle, of a bright red orenge colour, which being past, there come in their
places small hard whitish heads or seede vessels, containing blacke seede, like vnto the
seede of sweet Williams, and hauing but a small sent; the roote is very stringie, fastening
it selfe very strongly in the ground, whereby it is much encreased.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flore albo.<br>Et carneo.<br>Versicolor.</i></div>

<p>Of the single kinde there is also two or three other sorts, differing chiefly in the colour
of the flowers. The one is pure white. Another is of a blush colour wholly,
without variation. And a third is very variable; for at the first it is of a pale red, and
after a while groweth paler, vntill in the end it become almost fully white; and all these
diuersities of the flowers are sometimes to bee seene on one stalke at one and the same time.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">6. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lychnis Chalcedonica flore miniato pleno.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Double Flower of Bristow, or Nonesuch.</span>
</h4>

<p>This glorious flower being as rare as it is beautifull, is for rootes beeing stringie,
for leaues and stalkes being hairy and high, and for the flowers growing in tufts, altogether
like the first single kinde; but herein consisteth the chiefest difference, that
this beareth a larger vmbell or tuft of flowers at the toppe of the stalke, euery flower
consisting of three or foure rowes of leaues, of a deeper orenge colour then it, which
addeth the more grace vnto it, but passeth away without bearing seede, as most other
double flowers doe, yet recompenceth that defect with encrease from the roote.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">7. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lychnis plumaria siluestris simplex &amp; multiplex.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The featherd wilde Campion single and double.</span>
</h4>

<p>The leaues of this wilde Campion are somewhat like the ordinary white wilde<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Campion, but not so large, or rather resembling the leaues of sweete Williams, but
that they grow not so close, nor so many together: the stalkes haue smaller leaues at
the ioynts then those belowe, and branched at the toppe, with many pale, but bright
red flowers, iagged or cut in on the edges, like the feathered Pinke, whereof some haue
taken it to be a kinde, and some for a kinde of wilde William, but yet is but a wilde
Campion, as may be obserued, both by his huske that beareth the flowers, and by the
greyish roundish seede, being not of the Family of Pinkes and Gillowers, but (as I said)
of the Campions: the roote is full of strings or fibres.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flore pleno.</i></div>

<p>The double kinde is very like vnto the single kinde, but that it is lower and smaller,
and the flowers very double.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">8. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lychnis siluestris flore pleno rubro.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Red Batchelours buttons.</span>
</h4>

<p>The double wilde Campion (which of our Countrey Gentlewomen is called Batchelours
buttons) is very like both in rootes, leaues, stalkes, and flowers vnto the ordinary
wilde red Campion, but somewhat lesser, his flowers are not iagged, but
smooth, and very thicke and double, so that most commonly it breaketh his short
huske, wherein the flower standeth on the one side, seldome hauing a whole huske,
and are of a reddish colour.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">9. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lychnis siluestris flore albo pleno.</i></span>
  <span class="line">White Batchelours buttons.</span>
</h4>

<p>As the leaues of the former double Campion was like vnto the single kinde that had
red flowers, so this hath his leaues like vnto the single white kinde, differing in no other
thing from it, but in the doublenesse of the flowers, which by reason of the multiplicity
of leaues in them thrusting forth together, breaketh his huskes wherein the
flowers doe stand, as the other doth, and hath scarce one flower in many that is whole.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">10. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ocymoides arborea semper virens.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Strange Bassil Campion.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Strange Campion (for thereunto it must bee referred) shooteth forth many
round, whitish, wooddy, but brittle stalkes, whereon stand diuers long, and somewhat
thicke leaues, set by couples, narrow at the bottome, and broader toward the point,
of a very faire greene and shining colour, so that there is more beauty in the greene
leaues, which doe so alwaies abide, then in the flowers, which are of a pale red or
blush colour, consisting of fiue small long broad pointed leaues, notched in the middle,
which doe not lye close, but loosly as it were hanging ouer the huskes: after the
flowers are past, there come heads that containe blackish seede: the roote is small,
hard, white, and threadie.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">11. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Muscipula Lobelij siue Ben rubrum Monspeliensium.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Lobels Catch Flie.</span>
</h4>

<p>I must needes insert this small plant, to finish this part of the Campions, whereunto
it belongeth, being a pretty toye to furnish and decke out a Garden. It springeth vp (if
it haue beene once sowne and suffered to shed) in the later end of the yeare most commonly,
or else in the Spring with fiue or six small leaues, very like vnto the leaues of
Pinkes, and of the same grayish colour, but a little broader and shorter, and when it
beginneth to shoote vp for flower, it beareth smaller leaues on the clammy or viscous
stalkes (fit to hold any small thing that lighteth on it); being broad at the bottome
compassing them, and standing two at a ioynt one against another: the toppes of the
stalkes are diuersly branched into seuerall parts, euery branch hauing diuers small red
flowers, not notched, but smooth, standing out of small, long, round, stript huskes,
which after the flowers are past, containe small grayish seede: the roote is small,
and perisheth after it hath giuen seede; but riseth (as is before said) of its owne seede,
if it be suffered to shed.</p>

<p>The Rose Campions, Flowers of Bristow, or Nonesuch, the Bassil Campion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and the Catch Flie, haue been sent vs from beyond the Seas, and are
onely noursed vp in Gardens with vs; the other Campions that are double,
haue been naturally so found double wilde (for no art or industry of man,
that euer I could be assured of to be true, be it by neuer so many repetitions
of transplantations, and planeticall obseruations (as I haue said in the beginning
of this worke) could bring any flower, single by nature, to become
double, notwithstanding many affirmations to that purpose, but whatsoeuer
hath been found wilde to be double, nature her selfe, and not art hath so
produced it) and being brought into Gardens, are there encreased by slipping,
and parting the roote, because they giue no seede.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>All of them doe flower in the Summer, yet none before May.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first kindes are called <i>Lychnides satiuæ</i>, and <i>coronariæ</i>, in English generally
Rose Campions. The next is called <i>Lychnis Chalcedonica</i>, and <i>Byzantina</i>;
in English, of some Nonesuch, and of others Flower of Bristow,
and after the Latine, Flower of Constantinople, because it is thought the
seede was first brought from thence; but from whence the double of this
kinde came, we cannot tell. The names of the others of this kinde, both
single and double, are set downe with their descriptions. The feathered
Campions are called <i>Armoraria pratensis</i>, and <i>Flos Cuculi</i>, and of Clusius
and others thought to be <i>Odontitis Plinij</i>. Some call them in English Crowflowers,
and Cuckowe-Flowers; and some call the double hereof, The
faire Maide of France. The Bassil Campions were sent ouer among many
other seedes out of Italy, by the name of <i>Ocimoides arborea semper virens</i>.
<i>Arborea</i>, because the stalke is more wooddy and durable then other Campions:
And <i>semper virens</i>, because the leaues abide greene Winter and
Summer. Clusius calleth it <i>Lychnis semper virens</i>, because it is certainly a
Campion. The last is diuersly called of Authors; Lobel calleth it <i>Muscipula</i>:
Others <i>Armoraria altera</i>: Dodonæus <i>Armerius flos quartus</i>. Clusius
<i>Lychnis siluestris altera</i>, in his Spanish obseruations, and <i>prima</i> in his History
of plants, and saith, the learned of Salmantica in Spaine called it, <i>Ben rubrum</i>,
as Lobel saith, they of Mompelier doe also: and by that name I receiued
it first out of Italy. It hath the name of Catch Flie, of <i>Muscipula</i> the
Latine word, because the stalkes in the hot Summer dayes haue a certaine
viscous or clammy humour vpon them, whereby it easily holdeth (as I said
before) whatsoeuer small thing, as Flies, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> lighteth vpon it.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are two sorts of Wall-flowers, the one single, the other double, and of
each of them there is likewise some differences, as shall be shewed in their
description.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Keiri siue Leucoium luteum simplex vulgare.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Common single Wall-flowers.</span>
</h4>

<p>The common single Wall-flower which groweth wilde abroad, and yet is brought
into Gardens, hath sundry small, narrow, long, and darke greene leaues, set without
order vpon small round whitish wooddy stalkes, which beare at the tops diuers
single yellow flowers one aboue another, euery one hauing foure leaues a peece, and of
a very sweete sent: after which come long pods, containing reddish seede: the roote
is white, hard and thready.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Keiri siue Leucoium luteum simplex maius.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The great single Wall-flower.</span>
</h4>

<p>There is another sort of single Wall-flower, whose leaues as well as flowers are
much larger then the former: the leaues being of a darker and shining greene colour,
and the flowers of a very deepe gold yellow colour, and vsually broader then a twentie
shilling peece of gold can couer: the spike or toppe of flowers also much longer,
and abiding longer in flower, and much sweeter likewise in sent: the pods for seede
are thicker and shorter, with a small point at the end: this is slower to encrease into
branches, as also to be encreased by the branches, and more tender to be preserued;
for the hard frosts doe cause it to perish, if it be not defended from them.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Keiri simplex flore albo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">White Wall-flower.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Wall-flower hath his leaues as greene as the great kinde, but nothing so large:
the flowers stand at the toppe, but not in so long a spike, and consisteth of foure leaues,
of a very white colour, not much larger then the common kinde, and of a faint or
weaker sent: the pods are nothing so great as the former great one: this is more easie
to be propagated and encreased also, but yet will require some care in defending it
from the colds of the Winter.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Keiri siue Leucoium luteum vulgare flore pleno.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Common double Wall-flowers.</span>
</h4>

<p>This ordinary double Wall-flower is in leaues and stalke very like vnto the first single
kinde, but that the leaues hereof are not of so deepe a greene colour: the flowers
stand at the top of the stalkes one aboue another, as it were a long spike, which flower
by degrees, the lowest first, and so vpwards, by which it is a long time in flowring, and
is very double, of a gold yellow colour, and very sweete.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Keiri siue Leucoium luteum alterum flore pleno.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Pale double Wall-flowers.</span>
</h4>

<p>Wee haue another sort of this kinde of double Wall-flower, whose double flowers
stand not spike-fashion as the former, but more open spread, and doe all of them
blowe open at one time almost, and not by degrees as the other doth, and is of a paler
yellow colour, not differing in any thing else, except that the greene leaues hereof are
of a little paler greene then it.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">6. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Keiri siue Leucoium luteum maius flore pleno ferrugineo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Double red Wall-flowers.</span>
</h4>

<p>We haue also another sort of double Wall-flower, whose leaues are as greene, and
almost as large as the great single yellow kinde, or full as bigge as the leaues of the
white Wall-flower: the flowers hereof are not much larger then the ordinary, but are
of a darker yellow colour then the great single kinde, and of a more brownish or red
colour on the vnderside of the leaues, and is as it were striped.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">7. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Keiri siue Leucoium maximum luteum flore pleno.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The greatest double yellow Wall-flower.</span>
</h4>

<p>This great double Wall-flower is as yet a stranger in England, and therefore what I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>here write is more vpon relation (which yet I beleeue to be most true) then vpon sight
and speculation. The leaues of this Wall-flower are as greene and as large, if not larger
then the great single kinde: the flowers also are of the same deepe gold yellow
colour with it, but much larger then any of the former double kindes, and of as sweet
a sent as any, which addeth delight vnto beauty.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first single kind is often found growing vpon old wals of Churches,
and other houses in many places of England, and also among rubbish and
stones. The single white and great yellow, as well as all the other double
kindes, are noursed vp in Gardens onely with vs.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>All the single kindes doe flower many times in the end of Autumne, and
if the Winter be milde all the Winter long, but especially in the moneths
of February, March, and Aprill, and vntill the heate of the Spring doe
spend them: but the other double kindes doe not continue flowring in that
manner the yeare throughout, although very early sometimes, and very late
also in some places.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>They are called by diuers names, as <i>Viola lutea</i>, <i>Leucoium luteum</i>, and
<i>Keiri</i>, or <i>Cheiri</i>, by which name it is chiefly knowne in our Apothecaries
shops, because there is an oyle made thereof called <i>Cheirinum</i>: In English
they are vsually called in these parts, Wall-flowers: Others doe call them
Bee-flowers; others Wall-Gilloflowers, Winter-Gilloflowers, and yellow
Stocke-Gilloflowers; but we haue a kinde of Stocke-Gilloflower that
more fitly deserueth that name, as shall be shewed in the <a href="#Chap_2_XL" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 40">Chapter following</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The sweetnesse of the flowers causeth them to be generally vsed in Nosegayes,
and to decke vp houses; but physically they are vsed in diuers manners:
As a Conserue made of the flowers, is vsed for a remedy both for
the Appoplexie and Palsie. The distilled water helpeth well in the like
manner. The oyle made of the flowers is heating and resoluing, good to
ease paines of strained and pained sinewes.</p>

then for this our Garden of Pleasure, both for that diuers haue no good sent,
others little or no beauty, and to be entreated of onely for the variety, I shall spare so
many of them as are not fit for this worke, and onely set downe the rest.</p>

</h4>

<p>These single Stocke-Gilloflowers, although they differ in the colour of their flowers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>,
yet are in leafe and manner of growing, one so like vnto another, that vntill they
come to flower, the one cannot be well knowne that beareth red flowers, from another
that beareth purple; and therefore one description of the plant shall serue, with a declaration
of the sundry colours of the flowers. It riseth vp with round whitish woody
stalkes, two, three, or foure foot high, whereon are set many long, and not very broad,
soft, and whitish or grayish greene leaues, somewhat round pointed, and parted into
diuers branches, at the toppes whereof grow many flowers, one aboue another, smelling
very sweet, consisting of foure small, long, and round pointed leaues, standing in
small long huskes, which turne into long and flat pods, sometimes halfe a foote long,
wherein is contained flat, round, reddish seedes, with grayish ringes or circles about
them, lying flat all along the middle rib of the pod on both sides: the roote is long,
white, and woody, spreading diuers wayes. There is great variety in the colours of the
flowers: for some are wholly of a pure white colour, others of a most excellent crimson
red colour, others againe of a faire red colour, but not so bright or liuely as the
other, some also of a purplish or violet colour, without any spot, marke, or line in
them at all. There are againe of all these colours, mixed very variably, as white mixed
with small or great spottes, strakes or lines of pure or bright red, or darke red, and
white with purple spots and lines; and of eyther of them whose flowers are almost
halfe white, and halfe red, or halfe white, and halfe purple. The red of both sorts, and
the purple also, in the like manner spotted, striped, and marked with white, differing
neyther in forme, nor substance, in any other point.</p>

<p>There is very little difference in this kind from the former, for the manner of growing,

white flowers, in all other things alike: this is of no great regard, but only for rarity,

any of the former kindes, vneuenly gashed or sinuated on both edges lying on the
ground, and a little rough or hairy withall: from among which rise vp the stalkes, a yard
high or more, and hairy likewise, bearing thereon here and there some such like leaues as
are below, but smaller, and at the top a great number of flowers, as large or larger then
any of the former single kindes, made of 4. large leaues a peece also, standing in such
like long huskes, but of a darke or sullen yellowish colour: after which come long
roundish pods, wherein lye somewhat long but rounder and greater seede then any
stocke gilloflower, and nearer both in pod and seede vnto the <i>Hesperis</i> or Dames Violet:
this perisheth not vsually after seede bearing, although sometimes it doth.</p>

<p>This kind of stocke gilloflower riseth vp at the first with diuers long and somewhat
broad leaues, a little vneuenly dented or waued on the edges, which so continue the
first yeare after the sowing: the stalke riseth vp the next yeare to bee two foot high or
more, bearing all those leaues on it that it first had, which then do grow lesse sinuated
or waued then before: at the top whereof stand many flowers, made of foure leaues
a peece, of a delayed purple colour, but of a small sent which turne into very long and
narrow flat pods, wherein are contained flat seed like the ordinary stocke gilloflowers,
but much larger and of a darke or blackish browne colour: the root is white, and
groweth deepe, spreading in the ground, but growing woody when it is in seede, and
perisheth afterwards.</p>

</h4>

<p>This kinde of Stocke gilloflower differeth neyther in forme of leaues, stalkes, nor
flowers from the former, but that it oftentimes groweth much larger and taller; so that
whosoeuer shall see both these growing together, shall scarce discerne the difference,
onely it beareth flowers, eyther white, red or purple, wholly or entire, that is, of one
colour, without mixture of other colour in them (for so much as euer I haue obserued,
or could vnderstand by others) which are eyther single, like vnto the former, or very
thicke and double, like vnto the next that followeth; but larger, and growing with
more store of flowers on the long stalke. But this you must vnderstand withall, that
those plants that beare double flowers, doe beare no seede at all, and is very seldome
encreased by slipping or cutting, as the next kinde of double is: but the onely way to
haue double flowers any yeare, (for this kinde dyeth euery winter, for the most part,
after it hath borne flowers, and seldome is preserued) is to saue the seedes of those
plants of this kinde that beare single flowers, for from that seede will rise, some that
will beare single, and some double flowers, which cannot bee distinguished one from
another, I meane which will be single and which double, vntill you see them in flower,
or budde at the least. And this is the only way to preserue this kinde: but of the seed
of the former kinde was neuer known any double flowers to arise, and therefore you
must be carefull to marke this kinde from the former.</p>

<p>This other kinde of Stock gilloflower that beareth onely double flowers, groweth
not so great, nor spreadeth his branches so farre, nor are his leaues so large, but is in
all things smaller, and lower, and yet is woody, or shrubby, like the former, bearing
his flowers in the like manner, many vpon a long stalke, one aboue another, and
very double, but not so large as the former double, although it grow in fertile soyle,
which are eyther white, or red, or purple wholly, without any mixture, or else mixed
with spots and stripes, as the single flowers of the first kinde, but more variably, and
not in all places alike, neuer bearing seede, but must be encreased, only by the cutting
of the young sproutes or branches, taken in a fit season: this kinde perisheth not, as
the former double kinde doth, so as it bee defended in the winter from the extreame
frosts, but especially from the snow falling, or at the least remaining vpon it.</p>

  <span class="line">The double yellow Stocke Gilloflower.</span>
</h4>

<p>This double yellow Stock gilloflower is a stranger in England, as far as I can learne,
neyther haue I any further familiaritie with him, then by relation from Germany,
where it is affirmed to grow only in some of their gardens, that are curious louers of
these delights, bearing long leaues somewhat hoary or white, (and not greene like
vnto the Wallflower, whereunto else it might be thought to be referred) like vnto the
Stock gilloflowers, as the stalkes and branches also are, and bearing faire double
flowers, of a faire, but pale yellow colour. The whole plant is tender, as the double
Stock gilloflowers are, and must be carefully preserued in the winter from the coldes,
or rather more then the last double, lest it perish.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The single kindes, especially some of them, grow in Italie, and some in
Greece, Candy, and the Isles adiacent, as may be gathered out of the verses
in <cite>Plutarches Booke <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Amore fraterno</i></cite>:</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower in a manner all the yeare throughout in some places, especially
some of the single kindes, if they stand warme, and defended from
the windes and cold: the double kindes flower sometimes in Aprill, and
more plentifully in May, and Iune; but the double of seed, flowreth vsually
late, and keepeth flowring vnto the winter, that the frostes and colde
mistes doe pull it downe.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>It is called <i>Leucoium</i>, <i>&amp;</i> <i>Viola alba</i>: but the name Leucoium (which is in
English the white Violet) is referred to diuers plants; we call it in English
generally, Stocke gilloflower, (or as others doe, Stocke gillouer) to put a
difference betweene them, and the Gilloflowers and Carnations, which are
quite of another kindred, as shall be shewne in place conuenient.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>These haue no great vse in Physick that I know: only some haue vsed the
leaues of the single white flowred kinde with salt, to be laid to the wrests of
them that haue agues, but with what good successe I cannot say, if it happen
well I thinke in one (as many such things else will) it will fayle in a

<p>Vnto what tribe or kindred I might referre this plant, I haue stood long in suspence, in
regard I make no mention of any other <i>Lysimachia</i> in this work: lest therefore it should
lose all place, let me ranke it here next vnto the Dames Violets, although I confesse
it hath little affinity with them. The first yeare of the sowing the seede it abideth
without any stalke or flowers lying vpon the ground, with diuers long and narrow
pale greene leaues, spread oftentimes round almost like a Rose, the largest leaues being
outermost, and very small in the middle: about May the next yeare the stalke riseth,
which will be in Summer of the height of a man, and of a strong bigge size almost to a
mans thumbe, round from the bottome to the middle, where it groweth crested vp to
the toppe, into as many parts as there are branches of flowers, euery one hauing a small
leafe at the foote thereof: the flowers stand in order one aboue another, round about
the tops of the stalks, euery one vpon a short foot-stalke, consisting of foure pale yellow
leaues, smelling somewhat like vnto a Primrose, as the colour is also (which hath caused
the name) and standing in a greene huske, which parteth it selfe at the toppe into
foure parts or leaues, and turne themselues downewards, lying close to the stalke: the
flower hath some chiues in the middle, which being past, there come in their places
long and cornered pods, sharpe pointed at the vpper end, and round belowe, opening
at the toppe when it is ripe into fiue parts, wherein is contained small brownish seed:
the roote is somewhat great at the head, and wooddy, and branched forth diuersly,
which perisheth after it hath borne seede.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The two first grow for the most part on Hils and in Woods, but with vs

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower in May, Iune, and Iuly.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The name of <i>Hesperis</i> is imposed by most Herbarists vpon the two first
plants, although it is not certainly knowne to be the same that <cite>Theophrastus
doth make mention of, in his sixth Booke and twenty fiue Chapter <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de
causis plantarum</i></cite>: but because this hath the like effects to smell best in the
euening, it is (as I said) imposed vpon it. It is also called <i>Viola Marina Matronalis</i>,
<i>Hyemalis</i>, <i>Damascena</i> and <i>Muschatella</i>: In English, Dames Violets,
Queens Gilloflowers, and Winter Gilloflowers.</p>

<p>The last hath his Latine name in the title as is best agreeing with it, and
for the English, although it be too foolish I confesse, yet it may passe for
this time till a fitter be giuen, vnlesse you please to follow the Latine, and
call it Virginia Loose-strife.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>I neuer knew any among vs to vse these kindes of Violets in Physicke, although
by reason of the sharpe biting taste, Dodonæus accounteth the ordinary
sort to be a kinde of Rocket, and saith it prouoketh sweating, and vrine:
and others affirme it to cut, digest, and cleanse tough flegme. The
Virginian hath not beene vsed by any that I know, either inwardly or outwardly.</p>

the stalkes are round and hard, two foot high, or higher, diuided into many branches,
set with the like leaues, but smaller: the tops of the branches are beset with many purplish
flowers, like vnto Dames Violets, or Stocke Gilloflowers, but larger, being
of little sent: after the flowers are past, there come in their places round flat
thin cods, of a darke colour on the outside, but hauing a thinne middle skinne, that is
white and cleare shining, like vnto very pure white Sattin it selfe, whereon lye flat and
round brownish seede, somewhat thicke and great: the rootes perish when they haue
giuen their seede, and are somewhat round, long, and thicke, resembling the rootes of
<i>Lilium non bulbosum</i>, or Day Lilly, which are eaten (as diuers other rootes are) for Sallets,

leaues, snipt about the edges, of a whitish greene colour, from among which rise vp
diuers stalkes, replenished at the tops with many small flowers, standing together one
aboue another spike-fashion, which are small and somewhat sweete, while they are
fresh, fashioned somewhat like the common Tode flaxe that groweth wilde abroad almost
euery where, but much smaller, with a gaping mouth, but without any crooked
spurre behinde, like vnto them, sometimes of a sad purple neare vnto a Violet, and
sometimes of a paler blew colour, hauing a yellow spot in the middle or gaping place:
after the flowers are past, there come small, hard, round heads, wherein are contained
small, flat, and grayish seede: the roote is small and perisheth for the most part euery
yeare, and will spring againe of it owne sowing, if it be suffered to shed it selfe, yet
some hard Winters haue killed the seede it should seeme, in that sometimes it faileth
to spring againe, and therefore had neede to be sowne anew in the Spring.</p>

<p>The lower leaues of this purple Tode Flaxe are nothing like any of the rest, but are
long and broad, endented about the edges, somewhat resembling the leaues of the
greater wilde white Daisie: the stalke is set at the bottome with such like leaues, but
a little more diuided and cut in, and still smaller and smaller vpward, so that the vppermost
leaues are very like the common Tode Flaxe, the toppe whereof is branched,
hauing diuers small flowers growing along vpon then, in fashion and colour almost
like the last described Tode Flaxe, but not altogether so deepe a purple: the heads
and seedes are very like the former, but that the seede of this is reddish; the flowers
in their naturall hot Countries haue a fine sent, but in these colder, little or none at all:
the rootes are small and threadie, and perish after they haue flowred and seeded.</p>

bearing thereon many long narrow leaues, like the Garden Line or Flaxe, very thicke
set together, like vnto a bush, or rather like vnto a faire greene Cypresse tree, growing
broad belowe, and spire-fashion vpwards, of a very faire greene colour: at the seuerall
ioynts of the branches, towards the tops, and among the leaues, there come forth
small reddish flowers, not easily seene nor much regarded, being of no beauty, which
turne into small round blackish gray seede: the rootes are a number of blackish strings

<p>The leaues of these Snapdragons (for I doe vnder one description comprehend the

wilde Flaxe set confusedly vpon the tender greene branches, which are spread on all
sides, from the very bottome, bearing at the toppes many flowers, somewhat resembling
the former Tode Flaxe, but much larger, and without any heele or spurre, of a
faire white colour, with a yellow spot in the mouth or gaping place: after the flowers
are past, there come vp in their places hard round seede vessels, fashioned somewhat
like vnto a Calues head, the snout being cut off, wherein is contained small blacke
seede: the rootes are many white strings, which perish in most places after they haue

<p>The purple Snapdragon is in stalkes, leaues, and flowers altogether like the former,

Gesneri</i>, and giueth the same figure that Dodonæus hath for his <i>Pseudolysimachium</i>:
But that is one kinde of plant (which hath smaller and shorter
stalkes, and very narrow long leaues, whose flowers stand vpon long slender
cods, full of downe, with reddish seede, like vnto the <i>Lysimachia siliquosa

I know. It is vsually called <i>Chamænerium flore delphinij</i>; but the name of

  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aquilegia vulgaris flore simplici.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Single Colombines.</span>
</h4>

<p>Because the whole difference of these Colombines standeth in the varieties of the
forme, and colour of the flowers, and little in the leaues, I shall not neede to make anie
repetitions of the description of them, seeing one onely shall suffice for each peculiar
kinde. The Colombine hath diuers large spread leaues, standing on long stalkes:
euery one diuided in seuerall partitions, and roundly endented about the edges, in
colour somewhat like the leaues of Celondine, that is, of a darke blewish greene colour:
the stalkes rise vp sometimes two or three foote high, diuided vsually into many
branches, bearing one long diuided leafe at the lower ioynt, aboue which the flowers
growe, euery one standing on a long stalke, consisting of fiue hollow leaues, crooked
or horned at the ends, turning backward, the open flower shewing almost like vnto a
Cinquefoile, but more hollow: after the flowers are past, there arise small long cods,
foure or fiue together, wherein are contained blacke shining seede: the rootes are
thicke and round, for a little space within the ground, and then diuided into branches,
ending in many small fibres, abiding many yeares, and shooting a fresh euery Spring
from the round heads, that abide all the Winter. The variety of the colours of these
flowers are very much, for some are wholly white, some of a blew or violet colour, others
of a blush or flesh colour, or deepe or pale red, or of a dead purple, or dead murrey
colour, as nature listeth to shew it selfe.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">

</h4>

<p>The double Colombines differ not in leafe or manner of growing from the single,
so that vntill they come to flower, they cannot bee discerned one from another; the
onely difference is, it beareth very thicke and double flowers, that is, many horned or
crooked hollow leaues set together, and are not so large as the leaues of the single
flowers. The variety of colours in this double kinde is as plentifull, or rather more
then in the single; for of these is party coloured, blew and white, and spotted
very variably, which are not in the single kinde, and also a very deepe red, very thicke
and double, but a smaller flower, and lesse plentifull in bearing then many of the other
double sorts. These double kindes doe giue as good seede as the single kindes doe,
which is not obserued in many other plants.</p>

  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aquilegia inuersis corniculis.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Double inuerted Colombines.</span>
</h4>

<p>These Colombines are not to be distinguished eyther in roote, leaues, or seed from
the former, the flowers onely make the difference, which are as double as the former,
but that the heeles or hornes of these are turned inward, and stand out in the middle of
the flowers together: there is not that plentifull variety of colours in this kinde, as
there is in the former: for I neuer saw aboue three of foure seuerall colours in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
kinde, that is, white, purplish, reddish, and a dun or darke ouerworne purplish colour.
These double flowers doe likewise turne into pods, bearing seede, continuing his kind,
and not varying into the former.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aquilegia Rosea.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Rose Colombines.</span>
</h4>

<p>The leaues and other parts of this kinde of Colombine, differ little or nothing
from the former, the diuersitie consisteth likewise in the flowers, which although they
stand in the same manner seuerally vpon their small stalkes, somewhat more sparingly
then the former doe, yet they haue no heeles or hornes, eyther inward or outward, or
very seldome, but stand sometimes but with eight or tenne smooth small plaine leaues,
set in order one by one in a compasse, in a double rowe, and sometimes with foure or
fiue rowes of them, euery one directly before the other, like vnto a small thick double
Rose layd open, or a spread Marigold: yet sometimes it happeneth, that some of these
flowers will haue two or three of the first rowes of leaues without any heele, and the
rest that are inward with each of them a peece of a small horne at them, as the former
haue: the colours of these flowers are almost as variable, and as variably mixed as the
former double kindes. This likewise giueth seede, preseruing his owne kinde for the
most part.</p>

<p>This kinde of Colombine might seeme to some, to bee but a casuall degeneration,
and no true naturall kinde, happening by some cause of transplanting, or otherwise
by the art of man: but I haue not so found it, in that it keepeth, and holdeth his own
proper forme, which is like vnto the double Rose Colombine, but that the outermost
row of leaues are larger then any of the rest inwardes, and is of a greenish, or else of
a purplish greene colour, and is not altogether so apt to giue good seed like the former.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The single kindes haue beene often found in some of the wooddy mountaines

<p>Costæus doth call this plant <i>Pothos</i> of Theophrastus, which Gaza translateth

<i>Iouis flos</i> of <cite>Theophrastus, who in his sixth Booke and seuenth Chapter</cite> reckoneth
them both, that is, <i>Diosanthos</i> and <i>Pothos</i>, to be Summer flowers, but
seuerally. Dodonæus <i>Leoherba</i>, and Gesner <i>Leontostomium</i>. Fabius Columna
in his Phytobasanos, vnto whom Clusius giueth the greatest approbation,
referreth it to the <i>Isopyrum</i> of Dioscorides. All later Writers doe generally
call it, eyther <i>Aquileia</i>, <i>Aquilina</i>, or <i>Aquilegia</i>; and we in English, generally
(I thinke) through the whole Countrey, Colombines. Some doe call the
<i>Aquilegia rosea</i>, <i>Aquilegia stellata</i>, The starre Colombine; because the leaues
of the flowers doe stand so directly one by another, besides the doublenesse,
that they somewhat represent eyther a Rose or a Starre, and thereupon they
giue it the name eyther of a Starre or Rose.</p>

leaues (although lesser and darker, yet more spread, and on larger stalkes) that
they may easily deceiue one, that doth not marke them aduisedly; for the leaues are
much more diuided, and in smaller parts, and not so round at the ends: the stalkes are
round, strong, and three foote high at the least, branching out into two or three parts,
with leaues at the seuerall ioynts of them, at the toppes whereof stand many flowers,
which are nothing but a number of threads, made like vnto a small round tuft, breaking
out of a white skinne, or leafe, which incloseth them, and being vnblowne, shew
like vnto little buttons: the colour of these threds or tufts in this are whitish with yellow
tips on them, and somewhat purplish at the bottome, hauing a strong but no good

hot in the sun) a great while, and then fall away, like short downe or threds: the seed

the leaues of Colombines, diuided into fiue parts, indented about the edges, standing
on small long footestalkes of a whitish greene colour, among which rise vp the
stalkes, without any leaues from the bottome to the middle, where the flowers shoote
forth one aboue another, with euery one a small short leafe at the foote thereof, which
are long and hollow, with a spurre behinde it, somewhat like vnto the flowers of
Larckes spurres, but hauing their bellies somewhat bigger, and the mouth not so open,
being all of a pure white colour: after the flowers are past, arise small long and round
cods, wherein are contained round blackish seede: the roote is round and great, of a

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">O<span class="looks_big">f</span> Larkes heeles there are two principall kindes, the wilde kinde, and the tame
or garden; the wilde kinde is of two sorts, one which is with vs noursed vp
chiefly in gardens, and is the greatest; the other which is smaller and lower,
often found in our plowed landes, and elsewhere: of the former of these wilde sorts,
there are double as well as single: and of the tame or more vpright, double also and
single: and of each of diuers colours, as shall be set downe.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Delphinium maius siue vulgare.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The ordinary Larkes heeles.</span>
</h4>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Varietas.</i></div>

<p>The common Larkes heele spreadeth with many branches much more ground
then the other, rather leaning or bending downe to the ground, then standing
vpright, whereon are set many small long greene leaues, finely cut, almost like Fennell
leaues: the branches end in a long spike of hollow flowers, with a long spurre behinde
them, very like vnto the flowers of the Hollow roote last described, and are of
diuers seuerall colours, as of a blewish purple colour, or white, or ash colour or red, paler
or deeper, as also party coloured of two colours in a flower; after the flowers are
past, (which in this kinde abide longer then in the other) there come long round cods,
containing very blacke seede: the root is hard after it groweth vp to seede, spreading
both abroad and deepe, and perisheth euery yeare, vsually raising it selfe from it own
sowing, as well as from the seede sowen in the spring time.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Delphinium vulgare flore pleno.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Double common Larkes heeles.</span>
</h4>

<p>Of this vulgar kinde there is some difference in the flower, although in nothing else:
the flowers stand many vpon a stalke like the former, but euery one of them are as if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
three or foure small flowers were ioyned together, with euery one his spurre behinde,
the greatest flower being outermost, and as it were containing the rest, which are of a
pale red, or deepe blush colour: Another of this kinde will beare his flowers with
three or foure rowes of leaues in the middle, making a double flower with one spurre
behinde onely: and of this kinde there is both with purple, blew, blush, and
white flowers, and party coloured also; these doe all beare seed like the single, wherby
it is increased euery yeare.</p>

  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Delphinium aruense.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Wilde Larkes spurres.</span>
</h4>

<p>This wilde Larkes spurre hath smaller and shorter leaues, smaller and lower branches,
and more thinly or sparsedly growing vpon them, then any of the former: the
flowers likewise are neyther so large as any of the former, nor so many growing together,
the cods likewise haue smaller seede, and is harder to grow in gardens then any
of the former, the most vsuall colour hereof is a pale reddish or blush colour, yet sometimes
they are found both white and blew, and sometimes mixt of blew and blush, variably
disposed, as nature can when she listeth; but are much more rare.</p>

  <span class="line">Single vpright bearing Larkes heeles of many colours.</span>
</h4>

<p>The difference betweene this and the last is, that the leaues of this are not fully so
greene, nor so large; the stalkes grow vpright, to the height of a man, and sometimes
higher, hauing some branches thereon, but fewer then the former, and standing likewise
vpright, and not leaning downe as the former: the toppes of the stalkes are better
stored with flowers then the other, being sometimes two foote long and aboue,
of the same fashion, but not altogether so large, but of more diuers and seueral colours,
as white, pale, blush, redde deeper or paler, ashcoloured, purple or violet, and of an
ouerworne blewish purple, or iron colour: for of all these we haue simple, without
any mixture or spot: but we haue other sorts, among the simple colours, that rise from
the same seede, and will haue flowers that wil be halfe white, and halfe blush or purple,
or one leafe white, and another blush or purple, or else variably mixed and spotted:
the seede and seede vessels are like the former but larger and harder.</p>

  <span class="line">Double vpright Larkes heeles of many colours.</span>
</h4>

<p>These double Larkes heeles cannot bee knowne from the single of the same kinde,
vntill they come towards flowring; for there appeare many flowers vpon the stalkes, in
the same manner, and of as many colours almost as of the single, except the party coloured,
which stand like little double Roses, layd or spread broade open, as the Rose
Colombine without any heeles behinde them, very delightfull to behold, consisting
of many small leaues growing together, and after they are fallen there come vp in
their places three or foure small cods set together, wherein is contained here and
there (for all are not full of seede, as the single kindes) blacke seede, like vnto all the
rest, but smaller, which being sowen will bring plants that will beare both single and
double flowers againe, and it often happeneth, that it variably altereth in colours from
it owne sowing: for none of them hold constantly his owne colour, (so farre as euer
I could obserue) but fall into others; as nature pleaseth.</p>

  <span class="line">Spanish wilde Larkes spurres.</span>
</h4>

<p>This small Larkes spurre of Spaine, hath diuers long and broad leaues next the
ground, cut-in on both sides, somewhat like vnto the leafe of a Scabious, or rather that
kinde of Stœbe, which Lobel calleth Crupina, for it doth somewhat neerly resemble
the same, but that this is smooth on the edges, and not indented besides the cuts, as the
<i>Crupina</i> is, being of a whitish greene colour, and somewhat smooth and soft in
handling: among the leaues riseth vp a whitish greene stalke, hauing many smaller<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
leaues vpon it that grow belowe, but not diuided, branching out into many small
stalkes, bearing flowers like vnto the wilde Larkes heeles, but smaller, and of a bleake
blewish colour, which being past, there come vp two or three small cods ioyned together,
wherein is blacke seede, smaller and rounder then any of the former: the roote is
small and thready, quickly perishing with the first cold that ouertaketh the plant.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The greatest or first wilde kindes growe among corne in many countries
beyond the Seas, and where corne hath beene sowne, and for his beauty
brought and nourished in our Gardens: the lesser wilde kinde in some fields
of our owne Country. The Spanish kinde likewise in the like places, which
I had among many seedes that Guillaume Boel brought mee out of Spaine.
The first double and single haue been common for many yeares in all countries
of this Land, but the tall or vpright single kindes haue been entertained
but of late yeares. The double kindes are more rare.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>These flower in the Summer onely, but the Spanish wilde kinde flowreth
very late, so that oftentimes in our Country, the Winter taketh it before it
can giue ripe seede: the double kindes, as well the vpright as the ordinary
or wilde, are very choise and dainty many times, not yeelding good seede.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>They are called diuersly by diuers Writers, as <i>Consolida regulis</i>, <i>Calcaris
flos</i>; <i>Flos regius</i>, <i>Buccinum Romanorum</i>, and of Matthiolus, <i>Cuminum siluestre
alterum Dioscoridis</i>: but the most vsuall name with vs is <i>Delphinium</i>: but
whether it be the true <i>Delphinium</i> of Dioscorides, or the Poets Hyacinth, or
the flower of Aiax, another place is fitter to discusse then this. Wee call
them in English Larkes heeles, Larkes spurres, Larkes toes, or clawes, and
Monkes hoods. The last or Spanish kinde came to mee vnder the name of
<i>Delphinium latifolium trigonum</i>, so stiled eyther from the diuision of the
leaues, or from the pods, which come vsually three together. Bauhinus vpon
Matthiolus calleth it, <i>Consolida regalis peregrina paruo flore</i>.</p>

<p>I haue set this plant in this place, for some likenesse of the flower, rather then for
any other comparison, euen as I must also with the next that followeth. This plant
riseth vp with a thicke round reddish stalke, with great and bunched ioynts, being
tender and full of iuice, much like to the stalke of Purslane, but much greater, which
brancheth it selfe forth from the very ground, into many stalkes, bearing thereon manie
long greene leaues, snipt about the edges, very like vnto the Almond or Peach tree
leaues; among which from the middle of the stalkes vpwards round about them,
come forth vpon seuerall small short foot-stalkes many faire purplish flowers, of two
or three colours in them, fashioned somewhat like the former Larkes heeles, or Monks
hoods, but that they are larger open at the mouth, and the spurres behinde crooke or
bend downewards: after the flowers are past, there come in their places round rough
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>heads, pointed at the end, greene at the first, and a little yellower when they bee ripe,
containing within them small round blackish seede, which will soone skippe out of
the heads, if they be but a little hardly pressed betweene the fingers: the rootes spread
themselues vnder ground very much from the toppe, with a number of small fibres, annexed
thereunto: this is a very tender plant, dying euery yeare, and must bee sowne
carefully in a pot of earth, and tended and watered in the heate of Summer, and all
little enough to bring it to perfection.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e likenesse (as I said before) of this flower likewise, hauing spurres or heeles
maketh me ioyne it with the rest, which is of so great beauty and sweetnesse
withall, that my Garden of delight cannot bee vnfurnished of it. This faire
plant spreadeth it selfe into very many long trayling branches, enterlaced one within
another very confusedly (yet doth it not winde it selfe with any claspers about either
pole or any other thing, but if you will haue it abide close thereunto, you must tye it, or
else it will lye vpon the ground) foure or fiue foot in length at the least, wherby it taketh
vp a great deale of ground: the leaues are smooth, greene, and as round as the
Penniwort that groweth on the ground, without any cut or incisure therein at all
in any part, the stalkes whereof stand in the middle of each leafe and stand at euery
ioynt of the stalke, where they are a little reddish, and knobbed or bunched out:
the flowers are of an excellent gold yellow colour, and grow all along these stalkes,
almost at euery ioynt with the leaues, vpon pretty long foote-stalkes, which are composed
of fiue leaues, not hollow or gaping, but standing open each leafe apart by it
selfe, two of them, that be larger and longer then the other, stand aboue and the other
two that are lesser belowe, which are a little iagged or bearded on both sides, and the
first lowest: in the middle of each of the three lower leaues (yet sometimes it is but in
two of them) there is a little long spot or streake, of an excellent crimson colour, with
a long heele or spurre behinde hanging downe: the whole flower hath a fine small
sent, very pleasing, which being placed in the middle of some Carnations or Gillo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>flowers
(for they are in flower at the same time) make a delicate Tussimussie, as they
call it, or Nosegay, both for sight and sent: After the flower is past, come the seede,
which are rough or vneuen, round, greenish yellow heads, sometimes but one, and
sometimes two or three standing together vpon one stalke, bare or naked of themselues,
without any huske, containing a white pulpy kernell; the rootes are small,
and spreading vnder ground, which perish with the first frosts, and must be sowne a
new euery yeare; yet there needeth no bed of horse-dung for the matter: the naturall
ground will be sufficient, so as you defend it a little from those frosts, that may spoile
it when it is newly sprung vp, or being yet tender.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>This goodly plant was first found in the West Indies, and from thence
sent into Spaine vnto Monardus and others, from whence all other parts
haue receiued it. It is now very familiar in most Gardens of any curiosity,
where it yearly giueth ripe seed, except the yeare be very vnkindly.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>It flowreth sometimes in Iune, but vsually in Iuly (if it be well defended
and in any good ground) and so continueth flowring, vntill the cold frosts
and mistes in the middle or end of October, doe checke the luxurious nature
thereof, and in the meane time the seede is ripe, which will quickly fall
downe on the ground, where for the most part the best is gathered.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>Some doe reckon this plant among the <i>Clematides</i> or <i>Convolvuli</i>, the
Clamberers or Bindweedes; but (as I said) it hath no claspers, neither doth
it winde it selfe: but by reason of the number of his branches, that run one
within another, it may seeme to climbe vp by a pole or sticke, which yet
doth but onely close it, as hauing something whereon to leane or rest his
branches. Monardus and others call it <i>Flos sanguineus</i>, of the red spots in
the flowers, as also <i>Mastuerzo de las Indias</i>, which is <i>Nasturtium Indicum</i>, by
which name it is now generally knowne and called, and wee thereafter in
English, Indian Cresses, yet it may bee called from the forme of the flowers
onely, Yellow Larkes heeles.</p>

Yet because it is not onely a choise flower of delight, notwithstanding the popularity,
and that I let not passe anything without his particular description, I must
also doe so by this. And hereunto I must adde that kinde of Violet, which, although
it want that smell of the other, goeth beyond it in variety of dainty colours, called
<i>Viola tricolor</i> <i>&amp;</i> <i>flammea</i>, or Harts eases.</p>

  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Viola simplex Martia.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Single March Violets.</span>
</h4>

<p>The single Garden Violet hath many round greene leaues, finely snipt or dented about
the edges, standing vpon seuerall small stalkes, set at diuers places of the many
creeping branches, which as they runne, doe here and there take roote in the ground,
bearing thereon many flowers seuerally at the ioynts of the leaues, which consist of
fiue small leaues, with a short round tayle or spurre behinde, of a perfect blew purple
colour, and of a very sweete sent, it bringeth forth round seede vessels, standing likewise
vpon their seuerall small stalkes, wherein is contained round white seede: but
these heads rise not from where the flowers grew, as in all other plants that I know,
but apart by themselues, and being sowne, will produce others like vnto it selfe,
whereby there may be made a more speedy encrease to plant a Garden (as I haue done)
or any other place, then by slipping, as is the vsuall manner: the rootes spread both
deepe and wide, taking strong hold in the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flore albo.</i></div>

<p>Of this kinde there is another that beareth white flowers, not differing in smell or
any thing else from the former.</p>

<p>And also another, that beareth flowers of a dead or sad reddish colour, in all other

</h4>

<p>There is no difference betweene this Violet and the former, in any other thing then
in the doublenesse of the flowers, which haue so many leaues set and thrust together,
that they are like vnto hard buttons. There is of this double kinde both white and
purple, as in the single; but the white sort is seldome so thicke and double as the purple:
but of the red colour to be double I neuer heard.</p>

  <span class="line">Harts eases or Pansies.</span>
</h4>

<p>The Harts ease hath his leaues longer, and more endented or cut in on the edges
then the Violet hath, and somewhat round withall: the stalkes are vpright, yet weake,
and ready to fall downe, and lye vpon the ground, set here and there with the like
leaues, from whence come forth the flowers, of little or no sent at all, made like vnto a
Violet, yet more open, and with larger leaues; but so variably mixed with blew or
purple, white and yellow, that it is hard to set downe all the varieties; For some flowers
will be more white, and but some spots of purple or blew in the two vpper leaues,
and the lower leaues with some stripes of yellow in the middle: others will haue more
purple in them then any other colour, both in the vpper and lower leaues, the side
leaues blew, and the middle yellow, and others white and blew with yellow stripes, as
nature listeth to distribute their colours: the seede is small, whitish, and round, contained
in small round heads: the roote perisheth euery yeare, and raiseth it selfe vp
plentifully by it owne sowing, if it be suffered.</p>

<p>We haue in our Gardens another sort, that beareth flowers with more leaues then
the former, making it seeme to be twice double, and that onely in Autumne; for the
first flowers are single that come in Summer: This is of that sort that beareth purple
flowers: And it is to be obserued, that the seed of this kinde will not all bring double
flowers, but only some, if the ground be fit and liking, so that if you haue once had of
this double kinde, you shall seldome misse to haue double flowers againe euery yeare of
it owne growing or sowing.</p>

<p>There is one other kinde of Harts ease, that decketh vp our Gardens not to be forgotten,
whose leaues and flowers are like the former, but more plentifull in stalkes
and branches, and better abideth our Winters; the flowers are larger then any of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
former, of a faire pale yellow colour, with some yellower stripes now and then about
the middle; for it is sometimes without any stripes; and also of a little deeper yellow
colour: this is to bee encreased by slips, which will soone comprehend in a moist or
moistened ground, for that I neuer could obserue that it bore seede.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>These plants were first wilde, and by manuring brought to be both fairer
in colour, and peraduenture of a better sent then when they grew wilde.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The Violets flower in March, and sometimes earlier, and if the yeare be
temperate and milde, in Autumne againe. The double Violets, as they are
later before they flower then the single, so they hold their flowers longer.
The Harts ease flowreth seldome vntill May; but then some will abide to
flower vntill the end of Autumne almost, especially if the frosts be not early.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The Violet is called <i>Viola nigra</i>, <i>purpurea</i>, and <i>Martia</i>: In English, Violets,
March Violets, and purple Violets. The Harts ease is called <i>Viola
flammea</i>, <i>Viola tricolor</i>, <i>Viola multicolor</i>, and of some, <i>Iacea</i>, <i>Flos trinitatis</i>,
and <i>Herba clauellata</i>: In English, Harts ease, and Pansies, of the French name
Pensees. Some giue it foolish names, as Loue in idlenesse, Call mee to you,
and Three faces in a hood. The great yellow Harts ease is so called, because
it is like in forme, and is the greatest of all other, although it haue not
that diuersity of colours in it that the other haue.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The properties of Violets are sufficiently knowne to all, to coole and
moisten: I shall forbeare to recite the many vertues that may be set downe,
and onely let you knowe, that they haue in them an opening or purging quality,
being taken either fresh and greene, or dryed, and made into powder,
especially the flowers; the dryed leaues will doe the like, but in greater
quantity. <cite>Costæus in his booke of the nature of all plants</cite> saith, that the distilled
water of Harts ease, is commended in the French disease, to be profitable,
being taken for nine dayes or more, and sweating vpon it, which
how true it is, I know not, and wish some better experience were made of
it, before we put any great confidence in that assertion.</p>

plants. From the triple triplicitie of the standing of the stalkes and leaues,
and quadriplicitie of the flowers, it might receiue another name in English
then is already imposed vpon it: but lest I might be thought to be singular
or full of noueltie, let it passe with the name Barrenwort, as it is in the title.</p>

milke (as all the rest of the plant aboue ground doth, wheresoeuer it is broken) very
much rent or torne in on the sides, and notched or indented besides, compassing at the
bottome of them a hard round brittle whitish greene stalke, branched towards the
toppe, bearing one faire large great flower on the head of euery branch, which before
it breaketh out, is contained within a thin skinne, and being blowne open is very thick
of leaues, and double, somewhat iagged at the ends, and of a white colour, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a><br><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
middle whereof standeth a round head or bowle, with a striped crowne on the heade
of it, very like a starre, compassed about with some threds, wherein when it is ripe, is
contained small, round, white seede, disposed into seuerall cels: the roote is hard
wooddy, and long, perishing euery yeare, and must bee new sowne euery Spring, if
they doe not spring of their own sowing, which if it doe, the flowers are seldome so
faire and double as they that are sowne in the Spring: the whole plant is of a strong
heady smell.</p>

<p>This other kind of double Poppy differeth not in any other thing from the former,
but only in the colour of the flowers, which are of a bright red, tending to a blush colour,
parted, paned or striped in many places with white, and exceedingly more iagged
then the former, almost like a feather at the ends, the bottomes of all the leaues being

the ends, in some more, in some lesse, eyther red or blush, or purplish red, more or lesse,

to haue longer, narrower, and more iagged greene leaues then the former, the stalkes
more hairy, and the flower of a deepe yellowish red colour, knowne to all. Now this
differeth in nothing from it, but in the doublenesse of the flower, which is very thicke
and double, but not so large as the former. This riseth of seede in the like manner as
they doe, and so to bee preserued.</p>

<p>From what place they haue beene first gathered naturally I cannot assure

<p>Spanish Nigella riseth vp with diuers greene leaues, so finely cut, and into so many
parts, that they are finer then Fenell, and diuided somewhat like the leaues of Larkes
heeles, among which rise vp stalkes, with many such like leaues vpon them, branched
into three or foure parts, at the toppe of each whereof standeth one faire large flower,
like vnto other single Nigella’s, consisting of fiue or six leaues sometimes, of a bleake
blew, or of a purplish blew colour, with a greene head in the middle, compassed about
with seuen or eight small blewish greene flowers, or peeces of flowers rather, made
like gaping hoodes, with euery of them a yellowish line thwart or crosse the middle
of them, with some threds also standing by them: after the flower is past the head
groweth greater, hauing sixe, seuen or eight hornes as it were at the toppe, greater and
longer, and standing closer together then any other Nigella, spreading very like a
starre, or the crowne of the Poppy head, but larger and longer, each whereof being
folded together, openeth a little when the head is ripe, which is greater aboue, and
smaller below, and not so round as the others are, containing within them small yellowish
greene seede, or not so blacke as the other sorts: the rootes are small and yellow,
perishing euery yeare as the others likewise doe.</p>

<p>The double Nigella is in leaues, stalkes and rootes, very like vnto the former Nigella,
so that the one can very hardly bee discerned from the other before this rise vp
to flower, except it be that the leaues hereof are not fully so large as they: the flower
consisteth of three or foure rowes of leaues, layde one vpon another, of a pale blew
colour, with a greene round head compassed with diuers short threads in the middle,
and hauing fiue or sixe such small greene Fenell-like leaues vnder the flower, to beare
it vp (as it were) below, which adde a greater grace to the flowers, which at the first
sheweth sometimes white, but changeth quickely after: the horned heads hereof are

of a yellower greene colour, and not so finely cut and iagged: the flowers are
somewhat lesse, and lesser double then the former, and in colour white, hauing no
greene leaues vnder the flower, as the former hath, the head whereof in the middle is

<p>They are called <i>Melanthium</i>, <i>Gith</i>, and <i>Nigella</i>, and of some <i>Flos Diuæ
Catherinæ</i>. We may either call them <i>Nigella</i> according to the Latine name,
or the Fenell flower, as some doe, because the double blew Nigella hath
small Fenell-like leaues bearing vp the flower, as I shewed before in the description.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>These Nigella’s are nothing so hot in qualitie as the single Romane kind
is, as may well be knowne by the smell of the seede thereof, and therefore
are not fit to be vsed in the steed of it, as many ignorant persons vse to doe:
for the single Romane seede is vsed to helpe paines, and cold distillations in
the head, and to dry vp the rheume. Pena saith, that the pressed oyle of the
seede as well taken inwardly as vsed outwardly is an excellent remedy for
the hardnesse and swelling of the spleene.</p>

to bee a speciall remedy to helpe those that haue taken <i>Opium</i> too liberally.
In Italy some vse to eate the single kinde among other greene herbes, as

<p>We haue another sort of Camomill in some Gardens, but very rare, like vnto the
former, but that it is whiter, finer, and smaller, and raiseth it selfe vp a little higher,
and beareth naked flowers; that is, without that border of white leaues that is in the

  <span class="line">Double flowred Camomill.</span>

<p>The double Camomill groweth with his leaues vpon the ground, as the other single
kinde doth, but of a little fresher greene colour, and larger withall: the stalkes with
the flowers on them, doe raise themselues vp a little higher then the ordinary, and
bearing one or two flowers vpon a stalk, which are composed of many white leaues set
together in diuers rowes, which make a fine double flower, with a little yellow spot in
the middle for the most part of euery one, and are much larger then any single kinde,
smelling better, and more pleasing then the ordinary: this doth creepe vpon the
ground as the other, but is more tender to be kept in the Winter. Yet if you saue the
flowers hereof (and so will the double Featherfew also) when they haue stood long,
and ready to fade, and keepe them dry vntill the Spring, and then breaking them or
pulling them to peeces, sowe them, there will spring vp from them Camomill, and
also Featherfew, that will againe beare double flowers.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>Our ordinary Camomill groweth wilde in many places of our Country,
and as well neare London as in other places. The others are onely found in
our Gardens, where they are cherished. Bauhinus saith, that the double
flowred Camomill is found wilde about Orleance in France.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The double kinde is vsually in flower in Iune, before the ordinary kinde,
and most commonly past before it flowreth, which is not vntill Iuly or August.
The naked Camomill flowreth betweene them both, or later.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>Camomill is called <i>Anthemis</i>, <i>Leucanthemis</i>, and <i>Leucanthemum</i>, of the
whitenesse of the flowers; and <i>Chamæmælum</i> of the corrupted Italian name
<i>Camomilla</i>. Some call the naked Camomill, <i>Chrysanthemum odoratum</i>. The
double Camomill is called by some <i>Chamæmælum Romanum flore multiplici</i>.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>Camomill is put to diuers and sundry vses, both for pleasure and profit,
both for inward and outward diseases, both for the sicke and the sound, in
bathings to comfort and strengthen the sound, and to ease paines in the diseased,
as also in many other formes applyed outwardly. The flowers boyled
in Posset drinke prouoke sweat, and helpe to expell colds, aches,
and other griefes. A Syrupe made of the iuice of the double Camomill,
with the flowers and white wine, as Bauhinus saith, is vsed by some against
the Iaundise and Dropsie, caused by the euill disposition of the splene.</p>

<p>I must needes adioyne vnto the Camomils this fine and tender plant, for some neare
resemblance it hath with them in face, though not in quality. It is a small and lowe
plant, bearing many fine greene leaues vpon his slender branches, which leane or
lye down vpon the ground, diuided into many parts, yet somewhat larger and broader
then Camomill, the stalkes whereof are bigger, and more iuicie then it: the flowers
that stand at the toppes of the stalkes are single, but much larger then any Camomill
flower, hauing a pale or border of many leaues, white on the vpperside, and reddish
vnderneath, set about the yellow middle thrumme; but not standing so close together
ioyning at the bottome, as the Camomill flowers doe, but more seuered one from another:
it beareth small whitish seede, which is hardly found and discerned from the
chaffe: the roote is long, and growing downe right, of the bignesse of a mans finger
or thumbe in our Countrey, but not half so great where it groweth naturally, with
some fibres and branches from the sides thereof, of a very hot, sharpe, and biting
taste, drawing much water into the mouth, after it hath been chewed a while: the plant
with vs is very tender, and will hardly or not at all endure the hardnesse and extremities
of our Winters, vnlesse it be very carefully preserued.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>It groweth in Spaine wilde in many places, and in other hot Countries,
where it may feele no frosts to cause it perish.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>It flowreth so late with vs, that it is not vntill August, that oftentimes we
cannot gather ripe seedes from it, before it perish.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The name <i>Pyrethrum</i> (taken from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πὺρ</span>, that is, <i>ignis</i>, fire) is giuen to this
plant, because of the heate thereof, and that the roote is somewhat like in
shew, but specially in property vnto the true <i>Pyrethrum</i> of Dioscorides,
which is an vmbelliferous plant, whose rootes are greater, and more feruent
a great deale, and haue a hayrie bush or toppe as <i>Meum</i>, and many other
vmbelliferous plants haue. It is also called in Latin, <i>Salinaris</i>, of the effect
in drawing much moisture into the mouth, to be spit out. We doe vsually
call it Pelletory of Spaine.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>It is in a manner wholly spent to draw rheume from the teeth, by chewing
it in the mouth, thereby to ease the tooth-ach, and likewise from the head,

  <span class="line">The great Garden Marigold.</span>
</h4>

<p>Garden Marigold hath round greene stalkes, branching out from the ground
into many parts, whereon are set long flat greene leaues, broader and rounder at the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>point then any where else, and smaller also at the setting to of the stalke, where it compasseth
it about: the flowers are sometimes very thicke and double (breaking out of a
scaly clammy greene head) composed of many rowes of leaues, set so close together
one within another, that no middle thrume can bee seene, and sometimes lesse double,
hauing a small browne spot of a thrume in the middle: and sometimes but of two or
three rowes of leaues, with a large browne thrume in the middle; euery one whereof
is somewhat broader at the point, and nicked into two or three corners, of an excellent
faire deepe gold yellow colour in some, and paler in others, and of a pretty
strong and resinous sweete sent: after the flowers are past, there succeede heads of
crooked seede, turning inward, the outermost biggest, and the innermost least: the
roote is white, and spreadeth in the ground, and in some places will abide after the
seeding, but for the most part perisheth, and riseth againe of his owne seede. Sometimes
this Marigold doth degenerate, and beareth many small flowers vpon short
stalkes, compassing the middle flower: but this happeneth but seldome, and therefore
accounted but <i>lusus naturæ</i>, a play of nature, which she worketh in diuers other
plants besides.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calendula simplex.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The single Marigold.</span>
</h4>

<p>There is no difference betweene this and the former, but that the flowers are single,
consisting of one rowe of leaues, of the same colour; eyther paler or deeper yellow,
standing about a great browne thrumme in the middle: the seed likewise is alike, but
for the most part greater then in the double kindes.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>Our Gardens are the chiefe places for the double flowers to grow in; for
we know not of any other naturall place: but the single kinde hath beene
found wilde in Spaine, from whence I receiued seede, gathered by Guillaume
Boel, in his time a very curious, and cunning searcher of simples.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower all the Summer long, and sometimes euen in winter, if it be
milde, and chiefly at the beginning of those monethes, as it is thought.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>They are called <i>Caltha</i> of diuers, and taken to be that <i>Caltha</i>, whereof both
Virgil and Columella haue written. Others doe call them <i>Calendula</i>, of the
Kalendes, that is the first day of the monthes, wherein they are thought
chiefly to flower; and thereupon the Italians call them <i>Fiori di ogni mese</i>,
that is, The Flowers of euery moneth: We cal them in English generally,
eyther Golds, or Marigolds.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The herbe and flowers are of great vse with vs among other pot-herbes,
and the flowers eyther greene or dryed, are often vsed in possets, broths, and
drinkes, as a comforter of the heart and spirits, and to expel any malignant
or pestilential quality, gathered neere thereunto. The Syrupe and Conserue
made of the fresh flowers are vsed for the same purposes to good effect.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">D<span class="looks_big">i</span>oscorides and other of the ancient Writers, haue set forth but one kinde of
Starre-wort, which they call <i>Aster Atticus</i>, of the place no doubt, where the

Writers haue found out many other plants which they referre to this kinde, calling
them by the same name. It is not my purpose to entreate of them all, neyther doth
this garden fitly agree with them; I shall therefore select out one or two from the rest,
and giue the knowledge of them, leauing the rest to their proper place.</p>

<p>This Starre-wort riseth vp with two or three rough hairy stalkes, a foote and a halfe
high, with long, rough or hairie, brownish, darke greene leaues on them, diuided into
two or three branches: at the toppe of euery one whereof standeth a flat scaly head,
compared vnderneath with fiue or sixe long, browne, rough greene leaues, standing
like a Starre, the flower it selfe standing in the middle thereof, made as a border of

leaning downewards, whereon are set many somewhat hard, and rough long
leaues, round pointed, without order vp to the toppe, where it is diuided into seuerall
branches, whereon stand the flowers, made like vnto a single Marigold, with a border
of blewish purple leaues, set about a browne middle thrume, the heads sustaining
the flowers are composed of diuers scaly greene leaues, as is to be seene in the Knapweedes
or Matfelons, which after the flowers are past yeelde a certaine downe, wherein
lye small blacke and flat seedes, somewhat like vnto Lettice seede, which are carried
away with the winde: the roote is composed of many white strings, which perisheth
not as the former, but abideth, and springeth afresh euery yeare.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first is found in Spaine, as Clusius, and in France, as Lobel say. The

also, and other places; we haue it plentifully in our Gardens.</p>
</div>

<p>The first flowreth in Summer. And the other not vntill August or September.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is called <i>Aster Atticus flore luteo</i>, <i>Bubonium</i>, <i>&amp;</i> <i>Inguinalis</i>, and of
many is taken to be the true <i>Aster Atticus</i> of Dioscorides: yet Matthiolus
thinketh not so, for diuers good reasons, which hee setteth downe in the
<cite>Chapter of <i>Aster Atticus</i></cite>, as any man may vnderstand, if they will but reade
the place, which is too long to bee inserted here. The other is thought by
Matthiolus, to bee the truer <i>Aster Atticus</i>, (vnto whom I must also consent)
and constantly also affirmed to be the <i>Amellus Virgilij</i>, as may be seene in the
same place: but it is usually called at this day, <i>Aster Italorum flore cæruleo</i> or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[300]</a></span><i>purpureo</i>. Their English names are sufficiently expressed in their titles, yet
some call the last, The purple Marigold, because it is so like vnto one in form.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>They are held, if they bee the right, to bee good for the biting of a mad
dogge, the greene herbe being beaten with old hogs grease, and applyed;

the groine, as the name doth import.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">S<span class="looks_big">o</span>me resemblance that the flowers of this plant hath with the former Golds,
maketh me to insert it in this place, although I know it agreeth not in any other
part, yet for the pleasant aspect thereof, it must bee in this my garden, whose description
is as followeth: It hath many broade greene leaues spread vpon the ground,
spotted with pale spots, yet more conspicuous at sometimes then at other; somewhat
hairy both on the vpper and vnderside, in the middle of these leaues rise vp one, two
or more blackish hairy stalkes, two foote high at the least, bare or naked vp to the top,
where it beareth an vmbell, or short tuft of flowers, set close together vpon short
stalkes, of the forme or fashion of the Haukeweedes, or common Mouse-eare, but
somewhat smaller, of a deep gold yellow, or orenge tawney colour, with some yellow
threds in the middle, of little or no sent at all: after the flowers are past, the heads carry
small, short, blacke seede, with a light downie matter on them, ready to bee carried away
with the winde, as many other plants are, when they be ripe: the rootes spread
vnder ground, and shoote vp in diuers other places, whereby it much encreaseth, especially
if it be set in any moist or shadowie place.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>It groweth in the shadowie woods of France, by Lions, and Mompelier, as
Lobell testifieth: we keepe it in our gardens, and rather in a shadowie then
sunnie place.</p>

<p>It is called by Lobell, <i>Pulmonaria Gallorum Hieratij facie</i>: and the Herbarists
of France take it to be the true <i>Pulmonaria</i> of Tragus. Others call it <i>Hieratium
flore aureo</i>. Pelleterius <i>Hieratium Indicum</i>. Some <i>Pilosella</i>, or <i>Auricula
muris maior flore aureo</i>. And some <i>Chondrilla flore aureo</i>. Dalechamptus
would haue it to bee <i>Corchorus</i>, but farre vnfitly. The fittest English name
we can giue it, is Golden Mouse-eare, which may endure vntill a fitter bee
imposed on it: for the name of Grim the Collier, whereby it is called of
many, is both idle and foolish.</p>

greene colour: among which riseth vp one stalke, and no more for the most part, two
foote high or thereabouts, hauing here and there some narrower long leaues thereon
then those below: the toppe of the stalke brancheth it selfe forth into other parts,
euery one bearing a long scaly head, from out of the toppe whereof riseth a faire large
double flower, of a pale yellow colour, much like vnto the flower of yellow Goates
beard, but a little lesser, which being past, the seede succeedeth, being long, whitish
and rough, inclosed with much downe, and among them many other long smooth
seedes, which are limber and idle, and are carryed away at the will of the winde: the
roote is long, thicke and round, brittle and blacke, with a certaine roughnesse on the

<p>All the Goates beards haue long, narrow, and somewhat hollow whitish greene
leaues, with a white line downe the middle of euery one on the vpperside: the stalke
riseth vp greater and stronger then the Vipers grasse, bearing at the toppe a great long
head or huske, composed of nine or ten long narrow leaues, the sharpe points or ends
whereof rise vp aboue the flower in the middle, which is thicke and double, somewhat
broad and large spread, of a blewish ash-colour, with some whitish threads among
them, shutting or closing it selfe within the greene huske euery day, that it abideth
blowing, vntill about noone, and opening not it selfe againe vntill the next morning:
the head or huske, after the flower is past, and the seede neare ripe, openeth it
selfe; the long leaues thereof, which closed not before now, falling downe round about
the stalke, and shewing the seede, standing at the first close together, and the
doune at the toppe of them: but after they haue stood a while, it spreadeth it selfe
round, and is ready to be carried away with the winde, if it be not gathered: the seede
it selfe is long, round, and rough, like the seede of the Vipers grasse, but greater and
blacker: the roote is long, and not very great, but perisheth as soone as it hath borne
seede, and springeth of the fallen seede, that yeare remaining greene all Winter, and
flowring the next yeare following: the whole yeeldeth milke as the former, but somewhat

more, of a darke reddish purple colour, with some yellow dust as it were cast vpon it,

<p>They flower in May and Iune: the seede is ripe in Iuly.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>Their generall name is after the Greeke word <i>Tragopogon</i>, which is in Latine,
<i>Barbahirci</i>: In English, Goates beard; the head of seede when it is readie
to bee carried away with the winde, causing that name for the resemblance:
and because the flower doth euery day close it selfe at noone (as I
said before) and openeth not againe vntill the next Sunne, some haue fitly
called it, Goe to bed at noone.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The rootes of these kindes are a little more bitter and more binding also

<p>This goodly double flower, which is the grace and glory of a Garden in the time of

vnto the leafe of an Ash, being composed of many long and narrow leaues, snipt about
the edges, standing by couples one against another, with an odde one at the end, of a
darke or full greene colour: the stalke riseth to be three or foure foote high, and diuideth
it selfe from the middle thereof into many branches, set with such like leaues to
the toppes of them, euery one bearing one great double flower, of a gold yellow colour
aboue, and paler vnderneath, yet some are of a pale yellow, and some betweene
both, and all these rising from one and the same seede: the flower, before it be blowne
open, hath all the leaues hollow; but when it is full blowne open, it spreadeth it selfe
larger then any Prouince Rose, or equall vnto it at the least, if it be in good earth, and
riseth out of a long greene huske, striped or furrowed, wherein after the flower is past,
(which standeth in his full beauty a moneth, and oftentimes more, and being gathered,
may be preserued in his full beauty for two moneths after, if it be set in water)
standeth the seede, set thicke and close together vpright, which is blacke, somewhat
flat and long: the roote is full of small strings, whereby it strongly comprehendeth
in the ground: the flower of this, as well as the single, is of the very smell of new

<p>This single Marigold is in all things so like vnto the former, that it is hard to discerne
it from the double, but by the flowers, onely the stalke will be browner then
the double; and to my best obseruation, hath and doth euery yeare rise from the seede
of the double flower: so that when they are in flower, you may see the difference (or
not much before, when they are in bud) this single flower euer appearing with thrums
in the middle, and the leaues, which are the border or pale standing about them, shewing
hollow or fistulous, which after lay themselues flat and open (and the double
flower appearing with all his leaues folded close together, without any thrum at all)
and are of a deeper or paler colour, as in the double.</p>

<p>3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flos Africanus fistuloso flore simplex &amp; multiplex</i>.
Single and double French Marigolds with hollow leafed flowers.</p>

<p>As the former two greatest sorts haue risen from the seede of one and the same (I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>meane the pod of double flowers) so doe these also, not differing from it in anything,
but that they are lower, and haue smaller greene leaues, and that the flower also being
smaller, hath euery leafe abiding hollow, like vnto an hollow pipe, broad open at the
mouth, and is of as deepe a yellow colour for the most part as the deepest of the former,
yet sometimes pale also.</p>

  <span class="line">The lesser double French Marigold.</span>
</h4>

<p>The lesser double French Marigold hath his leaues in all things like vnto the former,
but somewhat lesser, which are set vpon round browne stalkes, not so stiffe or vpright,
but bowing and bending diuers wayes, and sometimes leaning or lying vpon the
ground: the stalkes are branched out diuersly, whereon are set very faire double flowers
like the former, and in the like greene huskes, but smaller, and in some the outermost
leaues will be larger then any of the rest, and of a deeper Orenge colour, almost
crimson, the innermost being of a deepe gold yellow colour, tending to crimson; the
whole flower is smaller, and of a stronger and more vnpleasant sauour, so that but for
the beautifull colour, and doublenesse of the flower, pleasant to the eye, and not to any
other sense, this kinde would finde roome in few Gardens: the rootes and seedes are
like the former, but lesser.</p>

  <span class="line">The small single French Marigold.</span>
</h4>

<p>This single kinde doth follow after the last in all manner of proportion, both of
stalkes, leaues, seedes, and rootes: the flowers onely of this are single, hauing fiue or six
broad leaues, of a deepe yellow crimson colour, with deepe yellow thrummes in the
middle, and of as strong a stinking sent, or more then the last.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>They growe naturally in Africa, and especially in the parts about Tunis,
and where old Carthage stood, from whence long agoe they were brought
into Europe, where they are onely kept in Gardens, being sowne for the
most part euery yeare, vnlesse in some milde Winters. The last single and
double kindes (as being more hardy) haue sometimes endured: but that
kinde with hollow leafed flowers, as Fabius Columna setteth it downe, is
accounted to come from Mexico in America.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower not vntill the end of Summer, especially the greater kindes:
but the lesser, if they abide all the Winter, doe flower more early.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>They haue been diuersly named by diuers men: Some calling them <i>Caryophyllus
Indicus</i>, that is, Indian Gilloflowers, and <i>Tanacetum Perüvianum</i>,
Tansie of Peru, as if it grew in Peru, a Prouince of America; and <i>Flos Indicus</i>,
as a flower of the Indies; but it hath not been knowne to haue beene
brought from thence. Others would haue it to be <i>Othonna</i> of Plinie, and others;
some to be <i>Lycopersicum</i> of Galen. It is called, and that more truely,
<i>Flos Tunetensis</i>, <i>Flos Africanus</i>, and <i>Caltha Africana</i>, that is, the flower of
Tunis, the flower of Africa, the Marigold of Africa, and peraduenture
<i>Pedna Pænorum</i>. We in English most vsually call them, French Marigolds,
with their seuerall distinctions of greater or smaller, double or single. To
that with hollow leafed flowers, Fabius Columna giueth the name of <i>Fistiloso
flore</i>, and I so continue it.</p>

<p>I take this goodly great old English Carnation, as a president for the description of
all the rest of the greatest sorts, which for his beauty and statelinesse, is worthy of a
prime place, hauing beene alwayes very hardly preserued in the Winter; and therefore
not so frequent as the other Carnations or Gilloflowers. It riseth vp with a great
thicke round stalke, diuided into seuerall branches, somewhat thickly set with ioynts,
and at euery ioynt two long greene rather then whitish leaues, somewhat broader
then Gilloflower leaues, turning or winding two or three times round (in some other
sorts of Carnations they are plaine, but bending the points downewards, and in some
also of a darke reddish greene colour, and in others not so darke, but rather of a whitish
greene colour:) the flowers stand at the toppes of the stalkes in long, great, and round
greene huskes, which are diuided into fiue points, out of which rise many long and
broad pointed leaues, deeply iagged at the ends, set in order round and comely, making
a gallant great double flower, of a deepe Carnation colour, almost red, spotted
with many blush spots and strakes, some greater and some lesser, of an excellent soft
sweete sent, neither too quicke as many others of these kinds are, nor yet too dull, and
with two whitish crooked threads like hornes in the middle: this kinde neuer beareth
many flowers, but as it is slow in growing, so in bearing, not to be often handled,
which sheweth a kinde of statelinesse, fit to preserue the opinion of magnificence:
the roote is branched into diuers great, long, wooddy rootes, with many small fibres

<p class="sub">The Brassill Gilloflower is but of a meane size, being of a sad
purple colour, thicke poudered and speckled with white,
the purple herein hath the mastrie, which maketh it shew
the sadder, it is vnconstant, varying much and often to
bee all purple: the greene leaues lye matting on the

<p class="smaller"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caryophyllus maior Granatensis.</i></p>

<p class="sub">The <i>Granado</i> Gilloflower is purple and white, flaked and striped

<p class="sub">The Poole flower, growing naturally vpon the rockes neare
Cogshot Castle in the Isle of Wight, is a small flower, but very
pleasant to the eye, by reason of the comely proportion thereof;
it is of a bright pale red, thicke speckled, and very small with
white, that it seemeth to bee but one colour, the leaues of the
flower are but smally iagged about: it is constant.</p>

<p class="smaller"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caryophyllus Pegma dilutior.</i></p>

<p class="sub">The light or pale Pageant is a flower of a middle size, very
pleasant to behold, and is both constant and comely, and but
that it is so common, would be of much more respect then it is:
the flower is of a pale bright purple, thicke poudered, and very
euenly with white, which hath the mastery, and maketh it the
more gracefull.</p>

<p class="smaller"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caryophyllus Pegma saturatior.</i></p>

<p class="sub">The sad Pageant is the same with the former in forme and

which maketh it so sad, that it doth resemble the Brassill
for colour, but is not so bigge by halfe.</p>

<p class="sub">Master Bradshawe his dainty Lady may be well reckoned among
these sorts of Gilloflowers, and compare for neatenesse
with most of them: the flower is very neate, though small, with
a fine small iagge, and of a fine white colour on the vnderside of
all the leaues, as also all the whole iagge for a pretty compasse,
and the bottome or middle part of the flower on the vpperside

<p class="smaller"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caryophyllus Persico violaceus.</i></p>

<p class="sub">The Gredeline Gilloflower is a very neate and handsome
flower, of the bignesse of the Cloue red Gilloflower, of a fine

<p class="sub">The blew Gilloflower is neither very double nor great, yet
round and handsome, with a deepe iagge at the edge, and is of
an exeeding deepe purple colour, tending to a tawnie; this
differeth from all other sorts, in that the leafe is as greene as
grasse, and the stalkes many times red or purple: by the greene

<p class="sub">There are also diuers other Tawnies, either lighter or sadder,
either lesse or more double, that they cannot be numbered, and
all rising (as I said before) from sowing the seede of some of

of some of them we haue abiding with vs, I meane such as haue
receiued names, and leaue the rest to euery ones particular
denomination.</p>

<p class="sub">Of Blushes there are many sorts, as the deepe blush, the pale
blush, the Infanta blush, a blush enclining to a red, a great blush,
the fairest and most double of all the other blushes, and many
others both single and double.</p>

<p class="sub">Of Reds likewise there are some varieties, but not so many as
of the other colours; for they are most dead or deepe reds, and
few of a bright red or stamell colour; and they are single like
Pinkes, either striped or speckled, or more double striped and
speckled variably, or else.</p>

<p class="sub">There are neither purple nor white that rise from this seede
that I haue obserued, except one white in one place.</p>

<p class="sub">The striped Tawny are either greater or lesser, deeper or lighter
flowers twenty sorts and aboue, and all striped with smaller or

but is of as great beauty and delight as it, or more: the flowers
are greater or smaller, deeper or lighter coloured one then another,
and the veines or markes more conspicuous, or more frequent
in some then in others: but the most beautifull that euer I

<p class="sub">Master Tuggies Princesse, which is the greatest and fairest of
all these sorts of variable tawnies, or seed flowers, being as large
fully as the Prince or Chrystall, or something greater, standing
comely and round, not loose or shaken, or breaking the pod as
some other sorts will; the marking of the flower is in this manner:
It is of a stamell colour, striped and marbled with white
stripes and veines quite through euery leafe, which are as deeply
iagged as the Hulo: sometimes it hath more red then white, and
sometimes more white then red, and sometimes so equally marked,
that you cannot discerne which hath the mastery; yet which
of these hath the predominance, still the flower is very beautifull,
and exceeding delightsome.</p>

<p class="smaller"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caryophyllus Silesiacus assulosus.</i></p>

<p class="sub">The Flaked Tawny is another diuersity of these variable or
mixt coloured flowers, being of a pale reddish colour, flaked
with white, not alwaies downeright, but often thwart the leaues,
some more or lesse then others; the marking of them is much
like vnto the Chrystall: these also as well as others will be greater

<p class="smaller"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caryophyllus Silesiacus

Tawnies, being raised from the seede of some of them, and onely
possessed by him that is the most industrious preseruer of all natures
beauties, being a different sort from all other, in that it hath
round leaues, without any iagge at all on the edges, of a fine stamell
full colour, without any spot or strake therein, very like vnto
a small Rose, or rather much like vnto the red Rose Campion,
both for forme, colour, and roundnesse, but larger for size.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>All these are nourished with vs in Gardens, none of their naturall places
being knowne, except one before recited, and the yellow which is <i>Silesia</i>;
many of them being hardly preserued and encreased.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower not vntill the heate of the yeare, which is in Iuly (vnlesse it
be an extraordinary occasion) and continue flowring, vntill the colds of the
Autumne checke them, or vntill they haue wholly out spent themselues,
and are vsually encreased by the slips.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>Most of our later Writers doe call them by one generall name, <i>Caryophyllus
sativus</i>, and <i>flos Caryophylleus</i>, adding thereunto <i>maximus</i>, when wee
meane Carnations, and <i>maior</i> when we would expresse Gilloflowers, which
name is taken from Cloues, in that the sent of the ordinary red Gilloflower
especially doth resemble them. Diuers other seuerall names haue beene
formerly giuen them, as <i>Vetonica</i>, or <i>Betonica altera</i>, or <i>Vetonica altilis</i>, and
<i>coronaria</i>. <i>Herba Tunica, Viola Damascena, Ocellus Damascenus</i>, and <i>Barbaricus</i>.
Of some <i>Cantabrica Plinij</i>. Some thinke they were vnknowne to the
Ancients, and some would haue them to be <i>Iphium</i> of <cite>Theophrastus, wherof
he maketh mention in his sixth and seuenth Chapters of his sixth booke,
among Garland and Summer flowers</cite>; others to be his <i>Dios anthos</i>, or <i>Iouis
flos</i>, mentioned in the former, and in other places. We call them in English
(as I said before) the greatest kindes, Carnations, and the others Gilloflowers
(<i>quasi</i> Iuly flowers) as they are seuerally expressed.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The red or Cloue Gilloflower is most vsed in Physicke in our Apothecaries
shops, none of the other being accepted of or vsed (and yet I
doubt not, but all of them might serue, and to good purpose, although not
to giue so gallant a tincture to a Syrupe as the ordinary red will doe) and is
accounted to be very Cordiall.</p>

  <span class="line">Double and single Pinkes.</span>
</h4>

<p>The single and double Pinkes are for forme and manner of growing, in all parts like
vnto the Gilloflowers before described, sauing onely that their leaues are smaller and
shorter, in some more or lesse then in others, and so are the flowers also: the single
kindes consisting of fiue leaues vsually (seldome six) round pointed, and a little snipt
for the most part about the edges, with some threads in the middle, either crooked or
straight: the double kindes being lesser, and lesse double then the Gilloflowers, hauing
their leaues a little snipt or endented about the edges, and of diuers seuerall colours,
as shall hereafter be set downe, and of as fragrant a sent, especially some of them as
they: the rootes are long and spreading, somewhat hard and wooddy.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caryophyllus plumarius.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Feathered or iagged Pinkes.</span>
</h4>

<p>The iagged Pinkes haue such like stalkes and leaues as the former haue, but somewhat
shorter and smaller, or grasse-like, and of a whitish or grayish greene colour likewise:
the flowers stand in the like manner at the toppes of the stalkes, in long, round,
slender, greene huskes, consisting of fiue leaues, very much cut in on the edges, and
iagged almost like a feather, of a light red, or bright purple colour, with two white
threads standing in the middle, crooked like a horne at the end, and are of a very good
sent. Some of these haue not those two crooked threads or hornes in the middle, but
haue in their stead many small threads, not crooked at all: the seedes of them all are
like vnto the seedes of Gilloflowers, or the other Pinkes, that is, small, blacke, long,
and flat: the rootes are small and wooddy likewise.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caryophyllus plumarius albus orbe rubro siue Stellatus.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Starre Pinkes.</span>
</h4>

<p>Of this kinde there is another sort, bearing flowers almost as deeply cut or iagged
as the former, of a faire white colour, hauing a ring or circle of red about the bottome
or lower part of the leaues, and are as sweete as the former: this being sowne of seede
doth not giue the starre of so bright a red colour, but becommeth more dunne.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caryophyllus plumarius Austriacus siue Superba Austriaca.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The feathered Pinke of Austria.</span>
</h4>

<p>This kinde of Pinke hath his first or lower leaues, somewhat broader and greener
then any of the former Pinkes, being both for breadth and greennesse more like vnto
the Sweete Iohns, which shall bee described in the <a href="#Chap_2_LXXI" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 71">next Chapter</a>: the leaues on the
stalkes are smaller, standing by couples at euery ioynt, at the toppes whereof stand
such like iagged flowers as the last described, and as large, but more deeply cut in or
iagged round about, some of them of a purplish colour, but the most ordinary with vs
are pure white, and of a most fragrant sent, comforting the spirits and senses a farre off:
the seedes and rootes are like vnto the former. Some haue mistaken a kinde of wilde
Campion, growing in our Woods, and by the paths sides in Hornsie Parke, and other
places, to be this feathered Pinke: but the flowers declare the difference sufficiently.</p>

  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caryophyllus minor repens simplex &amp; multiplex.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Single and double matted Pinkes.</span>
</h4>

<p>The matted Pinke is the smallest, both for leafe and flower of all other Pinkes that
are nourished in Gardens, hauing many short and small grassie greene leaues vpon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
stalkes, which as they grow and lye vpon the ground (and not standing so vpright as
the former) doe take roote againe, whereby it quickly spreadeth, and couereth a great
deale of ground in a little space: the flowers are small and round, a little snipt about
the edges, whereof some are white, and some red, and some are white spotted with
red, and some red spotted with white, all of them being single flowers. But there is
another of this kinde, not differing in leafe, but in flower: for that the first flowers are
but once double, or of two rowes of leaues, of a fine reddish colour, spotted with
siluer spots: but those that follow, are so thicke and double, that they oftentimes
doe breake the pod or huske; being not altogether of so deepe a red colour,
but more pale.</p>

  <span class="line">Great Sea Gilloflower or Great Thrift.</span>
</h4>

<p>Vnto these kindes of Pinkes I must needs adde, not only our ordinary Thrift (which
is more frequent in gardens, to empale or border a knot, because it abideth greene
Winter and Summer, and that by cutting, it may grow thick, and be kept in what form
one list, rather then for any beautie of the flowers) but another greater kinde, which
is of as great beautie and delight almost as any of the former Pinkes, as well for that
the leaues are like vnto Gilloflowers, being longer and larger then any Pinkes, and of
a whitish greene colour like vnto them, not growing long or by couples vpon the
stalkes as Pinkes and Gilloflowers doe, but tufting close vpon the ground, like vnto
the common Thrift: as also that the stalkes, rising from among the leaues (being sometimes
two foote high (as I haue obserued in my garden) are yet so slender and weake,
that they are scarce able to beare the heads of flowers, naked or bare, both of leaues
and ioynts, failing only in one place, where at the ioynt each stalke hath two small and
very short leaues, not rising vpwards as in all other Gilloflowers, Pinkes, and other
herbes, but growing downewards) and doe beare each of them a tuft or vmbell of
small purplish, or blush coloured flowers, at the toppes of them standing somewhat
like vnto sweete Williams, but more roundly together, each flower consisting of fiue
small, round, stiffe or hardish leaues, as if they were made of paper, the bottome or
middle being hollow, not blowing all at once as the ordinary Thrift, but for the most
part one after another, not shewing vsually aboue foure or fiue flowers open at one
time (so farre as I could obserue in the plants that I kept) so that it was long before the
whole tuft of flowers were past; but yet the hoter and dryer the time was, the sooner
it would be gone: the seede I haue not perfectly obserued, but as I remember, it was
somewhat like vnto the seede of Scabious; I am sure nothing like vnto Gilloflowers
or Pinkes: the roote is somewhat great, long and hard, and not so much spreading in
the ground as Gilloflowers or Pinkes.</p>

  <span class="line">7. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caryophyllus Marinus.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Thrift, or Sea Cushion.</span>
</h4>

<p>Our common Thrift is well knowne vnto all, to haue many short and hard greene
leaues, smaller then many of the grasses, growing thicke together, and spreading
vpon the ground: the stalkes are naked of leaues a spanne high, bearing a small tuft of
light purple, or blush coloured flowers, standing round and close thrusting together.</p>

<hr class="lists">

<div class="latin">

<h4>Double Pinkes.</h4>

<p>The double white Pinke is onely
with more leaues in it then the single
which maketh the difference.</p>

<p>The double red Pinke is in the same
manner double, differing from the single
of the same colour.</p>

<p>The double purple Pinke differeth not
from the single purple for colour, but only
in the doublenesse of the flower.</p>

<p>The <i>Granado</i> Pinke differeth not from
the Gilloflower of the same name, but in
the smalnesse both of leaues and flower.</p>

<p>The double Matted Pinke is before described.</p>

<p>The double blush Pinke is almost as
great as the ordinary blush Gilloflower,
and some haue taken it for one, but the
greene leaues are almost as small as Pinks,
and therefore I referre it to them.</p>

<h4>Single Pinkes.</h4>

<p>The single white ordinary Pinke
hath a single white flower of fiue
leaues, finely iagged about the
edges.</p>

<p>The single red pink is like the white, but
that the leaues are not so much iagged, and
the flower is of a pale purplish red colour,</p>

<p>The single purple Pinke is of a faire
purple colour, like almost vnto the purple
Gilloflower.</p>

<p>The great blush Pinke hath broader and
larger leaues in the flower then any other
Pinke, and of a faire blush colour.</p>

<p>The white Featherd Pinke hath the
edges of the flower more finely and deeply
cut in then the former.</p>

<p>The red or light purple featherd Pinke
is like the former featherd Pinke, but only
differeth in colour.</p>

<p>The Starre Pinke is a faire flower, finely
iagged on the edges, with a faire red circle at the lower end of the leaues on the inside.</p>

<p>The white featherd Pinke of Austria is described before. The purple featherd
Pinke of Austria is so likewise. The single matted Pinke is before described. The
speckled Pinke is a small flower hauing small spots of red here and there dispersed
ouer the white flower.</p>

<p>Those single flowers being like vnto Pinkes that rise from the sowing of the orenge
tawney, I bring not into this <i>classis</i>, hauing already spoken of them in the <a href="#Chap_2_LXIX" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 69">precedent
Chapter</a>.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>These are all like as the former, nourished in Gardens with vs, although
many of them are found wilde in many places of Austria, Hungarie, and
Germany, on the mountaines, and in many other places, as Clusius recordeth.
The ordinary Thrift groweth in the salt Marshes at Chattam by Rochester,
and in many other places in England: but the great kinde was gathered
in Spaine, by Guillaume Boel that painefull searcher of simples,
and the seede thereof imparted to me, from whence I had diuers plants,
but one yeare after another they all perished.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>Many of these Pinkes both single and double, doe flower before any
Gilloflower, and so continue vntill August, and some, most of the Summer
and Autumne.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The seuerall titles that are giuen to these Pinkes, may suffice for their particular
names: and for their generall they haue beene expressed in the <a href="#Chap_2_LXIX" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 69">former
Chapter</a>, beeing of the same kindred, but that they are smaller, and
more frequently found wilde. The two sorts of Thrift are called <i>Caryophyllus
Marinus</i>. The greater, <i>Maior &amp; Mediterraneus</i>; In English, The greater
or Leuant Thrift, or Sea Gilloflower. The lesser <i>Minimus</i>, and is accounted
of some to be a grasse, and therefore called <i>Gramen Marinum &amp;
Polyanthemum</i>; In English, Thrift, Sea grasse, and our Ladies Cushion,
or Sea Cushion.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>It is thought by diuers, that their vertues are answerable to the Gilloflowers,
yet as they are of little vse with vs, so I thinke of as small effect.</p>

though manifestly differing, so it is fitted to place them next vnto them in
a peculiar Chapter.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Armerius angustifolius rubens simplex.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Single red sweete Iohns.</span>
</h4>

<p>The sweete Iohn hath his leaues broader, shorter, and greener then any of the former
Gilloflowers, but narrower then sweete Williams, set by couples, at the
ioynts of the stalkes, which are shorter then most of the former, and not aboue a
foote and a halfe high, at the tops whereof stand many small flowers, like vnto small
Pinkes, but standing closer together, and in shorter huskes, made of fiue leaues, smaller
then most of them, and more deeply iagged then the Williams, of a red colour in
the middle, and white at the edges, but of a small or soft sent, and not all flowring at
once, but by degrees: the seede is blacke, somewhat like vnto the seede of Pinkes,
the roote is dispersed diuersly, with many small fibres annexed vnto it.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Armerius angustifolius albus simplex.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Single white sweet Iohns.</span>
</h4>

<p>This white Iohn differeth not in any thing from the former, but onely that the leafe
doth neuer change brownish, and that the flower is of a faire white colour, without
any mixture.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Armerius angustifolius duplex.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Double sweet Iohns.</span>
</h4>

<p>There is of both those former kindes, some whose flowers are once double, that is,
consisting of two or three rowes of leaues, and the edges not so deeply iagged; not
differing in any thing else.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Armerius latifolius simplex flore rubro.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Single red sweet Williams.</span>
</h4>

<p>The sweet Williams doe all of them spread into many very long traylng branches,
with leaues lying on the ground, in the very like manner that the sweete Iohns doe:
the chiefe differences betweene them are, that these haue broader, and darker greene
leaues, somewhat brownish, especially towards the points, and that the flowers stand
thicker and closer, and more in number together, in the head or tuft, hauing many small
pointed leaues among them, but harmlesse, as all men know; the colour of the flower is
of a deep red, without any mixture or spot at all.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Armerius latifolius flore rubro multiplici.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Double red sweete Williams.</span>
</h4>

<p>The double kinde differeth not from the single kinde of the same colour, but only in
the doublenesse of the flowers, which are with two rowes of leaues in euery flower.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">6. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Armerius latifolius variegatus siue versicolor.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Speckled sweete Williams, or London pride.</span>
</h4>

<p>These spotted Williams are very like the first red Williams, in the forme or maner
of growing, hauing leaues as broade, and browne sometimes as they, the flowers, stand
as thicke or thicker, clustring together, but of very variable colours: for some
flowers will be of a fine delayed red, with few markes or spots vpon them, and others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
will bee full speckled or sprinkled with white or siluer spots, circlewise about the middle
of the flowers, and some will haue many specks or spots vpon them dispersed:
all these flowers are not blowne at one time, but some are flowring, when others are
decaying, so that abiding long in their pride, they become of the more respect: The
seede is blacke, as all the rest, and not to be distinguished one from another: the roots
are some long, and some small and threddy, running vnder the vpper crust of the earth.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">

  <span class="line">Sweet Williams of a deepe red or murrey colour.</span>
</h4>

<p>The leaues of this kinde seeme to be a little larger, and the ioints a little redder
then the former, but in the flower consisteth the chiefest difference, which is of a
deepe red, or murrey purple colour, like vnto veluet of that colour, without any spots,
but smooth, and as it were soft in handling, hauing an eye or circle in the middle, at
the bottome of the leaues.</p>

<p>The white kinde differeth not in forme, but in colour from the former, the leaues
are not browne at all, but of a fresh greene colour, and the flowers are wholly white,
or else they are all one.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>These for the most part grow wilde in Italie, and other places: we haue
them in our Gardens, where they are cherished for their beautifull varietie.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They all generally doe flower before the Gilloflowers or Pinkes, or with
the first of them: their seede is ripe in Iune and Iuly, and doe all well abide
the extremitie of our coldest winters.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>They all generally are called <i>Armerius</i>, or <i>Armeria</i>, as some doe write,
and distinguished as they are in their titles: Yet some haue called them <i>Vetonica
agrestis</i>, and others <i>Herba Tunica</i>, <i>Scarlatea</i>, &amp; <i>Caryophyllus siluestris</i>:
Wee doe in English in most places, call the first or narrower leafed kindes,
Sweet Iohns, and all the rest Sweete Williams; yet in some places they call
the broader leafed kindes that are not spotted, Tolmeiners, and London
tufts: but the speckled kinde is termed by our English Gentlewomen, for

  <span class="line">The great double white Daisie.</span>
</h4>

<p>The great Daisie with the double white flower, is in all things so like vnto the great
single kinde, that groweth by the high wayes, and in diuers medowes and fields, that
there is no difference but in the flower, which is double. It hath many long, and somewhat
broad leaues lying vpon the ground, deepely cut in on both sides, somewhat
like vnto an oaken leafe; but those that are on the stalkes are shorter, narrower, and
not so deeply cut in, but onely notched on the edges: the flowers at the toppe are (as
I said) white and double, consisting of diuers rowes of leaues, being greater in compasse
then any of the double Daisies that follow, but nothing so double of leaues.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bellis minor flore rubro simplici.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Single red Daisies.</span>
</h4>

<p>This single Daisie (like as all the rest of the small Daisies) hath many smooth,
greene, round pointed leaues lying on the ground, a little snipt about the edges; from
among which rise many slender round foote-stalkes, rather then stalkes or stems, about
an hand breadth high at the most, and oftentimes not halfe so high, bearing one flower
a peece, consisting of many small leaues, as a pale or border set about a middle
thrumme: the leaues of this kinde are almost wholly red, whereas in the wilde they
are white or whitish, enclining to red on the edges, the middle being yellow in both
sorts: the rootes are many small white threads or strings.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bellis minor hortensis flore pleno variorum colorum.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Double Garden Daisies of diuers colours.</span>
</h4>

<p>The leaues of all the double Daisies are in forme like vnto the single ones, but that
they are smaller, and little or nothing snipt or notched about the edges: the small
stalkes like wise are smaller and lower, but bearing as double flowers as any that growe
on the ground, being composed of many small leaues, thicke thrust together, of diuers
colours; for some are wholly of a pure white, others haue a little red, either dispersed
vpon the white leaues, or on the edges, and sometimes on the backes of the leaues:
some againe seeme to be of a whitish red, or more red then white, when as indeede
they are white leaues dispersed among the red; others of a deepe or darke red colour,
and some are speckled or striped with white and red through the whole flower: and
some the leaues will bee red on the vpperside, and white vnderneath; and some also
(but those are very rare) are of a greenish colour.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bellis minor hortensis prolifera.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Double double Daisies or childing Daisies.</span>
</h4>

<p>There is no difference either in leafe or roote in this kinde from the former double
Daisies: the chiefest variety consisteth in this, that it beareth many small double flowers,
standing vpon very short stalkes round about the middle flower, which is vsually
as great and double as any of the other double kindes, and is either wholly of a deepe
red colour, or speckled white and red as in some of the former kindes, or else greenish,
all the small flowers about it being of the same colour with the middlemost.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bellis cærulea siue Globularia.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Blew Daisies.</span>
</h4>

<p>The likenesse and affinity that this plant hath with the former, both in the forme
of leafe and flower, as also in the name, hath caused me to insert it, and another rare
plant of the same kinde, in this place, although they be very rare to be met with in our
English Gardens. This beareth many narrower, shorter, and blacker greene leaues
then the former, lying round about vpon the ground; among which rise vp slender,
but stiffe and hard stalks, halfe a foot high or more, set here and there with small leaues,
and at the top a small round head, composed of many small blew leaues, somewhat like
vnto the head of a Scabious: It hath bin found likewise with a white head of flowers:
the roote is hard and stringie: the whole plant is of a bitter taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">6. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Globularia lutea montana.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Yellow Daisies.</span>
</h4>

<p>This mountaine yellow Daisie or Globe-flower hath many thicke, smooth, round
pointed leaues, spread vpon the ground like the former; among which spring diuers
small round rushie stalkes, a foote high, bearing about the middle of them two small
leaues at the ioynts, and at the toppes round heads of flowers thrust thicke together,
standing in purplish huskes, euery of which flowers do blow or spread into fiue leaues,
starre-fashion, and of a faire yellow colour, smelling like vnto broome flowers, with
many small threads in the middle compassing a flat pointell, horned or bended two
wayes: after the flowers are past rise vp the seede vessels, which are round, swelling
out in the middle, and diuided into foure parts at the toppes, containing within them
round, flat, blacke seede, with a small cut or notch in them: the roote is a finger long,
round and hard, with a thicke barke, and a woddy pith in the middle, of a sharpe drying
taste and strong sent: the leaues are also sharpe, but bitter.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The small Daisies are all planted, and found onely in Gardens, and will
require to be replanted often, lest they degenerate into single flowers, &amp; at
least into lesse double. The blew Daisie is naturall of Mompelier in
France, and on the mountaines in many places of Italy, as also the yellow
kinde in the Kingdome of Naples.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The Daisies flower betimes in the Spring, and last vntill May, but the
last two flower not vntill August or September.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>They are vsually called in Latine <i>Bellides</i>, and in English Daisies. Some
call them <i>Herba Margarita</i>, and <i>Primula veris</i>, as it is likely after the Italian
names, of <i>Marguerite</i>, and <i>Flor di prima vera gentile</i>. The French call them
<i>Pasquettes</i>, and <i>Marguerites</i>, and the Fruitfull sort, or those that beare small
flowers about the middle one, <i>Margueritons</i>: our English women call
them Iacke an Apes on horse-backe, as they doe Marigolds before recited,
or childing Daisies: but the Physitians and Apothecaries doe in generall
call them, especially the single or Field kindes, <i>Consolida minor</i>. The blew
Daisie is called <i>Bellis cærulea</i>, and <i>Globularia</i>, of some <i>Scabiosæ pumilum genus</i>.
The Italians call it <i>Botanaria</i>, because the heads are found like buttons.
The yellow, <i>Globularia montana</i>, is onely described by Fabius Columna, in
his last part of <i>Phytobasanos</i>, and by him referred vnto the former <i>Globularia</i>,
although it differ in some notable points from it.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The properties of Daisies are certainly to binde, and the roote especially
being dryed, they are vsed in medicines to that purpose. They are
also of speciall account among those herbes, that are vsed for wounds in
the head.</p>

  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scabiosa rubra Austriaca.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Red Scabious of Austria.</span>
</h4>

<p>This red Scabious hath many leaues lying vpon the ground, very like vnto Deuils
bit, but not so large, being shorter and snipt, not gashed about the edges, of a light
greene colour; yet (there is another of a darker greene colour, whose flower is of a
deeper red) the stalkes haue diuers such leaues on them, set by couples at the ioynts as
grow belowe, and at the tops small heads of flowers, each consisting of fiue leaues,
the biggest flowers standing round about in the outer compasse, as is vsuall almost in
all the kinds of Scabious, of a fine light purple or red colour: after the flowers are past,
come the seede, which is somewhat long and round, set with certaine haires at the

  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scabiosa rubra Indica.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Red flowred Indian Scabious.</span>

<p>This (reputed Indian) Scabious hath many large faire greene leaues lying on the

narrower then that at the end, which is the broadest: among these leaues rise vp sundry
slender and weake stalkes, yet standing vpright for the most part, set with smaller

forth at the toppe into other smaller branches, bearing euery one head of flowers,
like in forme vnto other Scabiouses, but of an excellent deepe red crimson colour (and
sometimes more pale or delayed) of no sent at all; after which doe come small roundish
seede, like vnto the field Scabious: the roote is long and round, compassed with
a great many small strings, and perisheth vsually as soone as it hath borne out his flowers
and seede: otherwise if it doe not flower the first yeare of the sowing, if it be carefully
defended from the extremity of Winter, it will flower the sooner the next yeare,
as I my selfe haue often found by experience.</p>

from the excellent blew colour of their flowers (furnishing or rather pestering

vary also, in the colour of the flowers, as shall be shewed; but some other plants also for
their neere resemblance, but with seuerall distinctions. The <i>Cyanus maior</i>, <i>Ptarmica

  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanus vulgaris diuersorum colorum.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Corne flower of diuers colours.</span>
</h4>

<p>All these sorts of Corne flowers are for the most part alike, both in leaues and
flowers one vnto another for the forme: the difference betweene them consisteth in
the varying colour of the flowers: For the leaues are long, and of a whitish greene
colour, deeply cut in on the edges in some places, somewhat like vnto the leaues of a
Scabious: the stalkes are two foote high or better, beset with such like leaues but smaller,
and little or nothing cut in on the edges: the toppes are branched, bearing many small
greene scaly heads, out of which rise flowers, consisting of fiue or sixe, or more long
and hollow leaues, small at the bottome, and opening wider and greater at the brims,
notched or cut in on the edges, and standing round about many small threds in the
middle: the colours of these flowers are diuers, and very variable; for some are
wholly blew, or white, or blush, or of a sad, or light purple, or of a light or dead red,
or of an ouerworne purple colour, or else mixed of these colours, as some, the edges
white, and the rest blew or purple, or the edges blew or purple, and the rest of the
flower white, or striped, spotted, or halfed, the one part of one colour, and the other
of another, the threds likewise in the middle varying in many of them; for some
will haue the middle thrume of a deeper purple then the outer leaues, and some haue
white or blush leaues, the middle thrume being reddish, deeper or paler. After the
flowers are past, there come small, hard, white and shining seede in those heads, wrap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>ped
or set among a deale of flockie matter, as is most vsuall, in all plants that beare
scaly heads: the rootes are long and hard, perishing euery yeare when it hath giuen
seede.</p>

  <span class="line">The Sultans flower.</span>
</h4>

<p>As a kinde of these Corne flowers, I must needes adioyne another stranger, of much
beautie, and but lately obtained from Constantinople, where, because (as it is said) the
great Turke, as we call him, saw it abroade, liked it, and wore it himselfe; all his vassals
haue had it in great regard, and hath been obtained from them, by some that haue sent
it into these parts. The leaues whereof are greener, and not only gashed, but finely
snipt on the edges: the stalkes are three foote high, garnished with the like leaues as
are below, and branched as the former, bearing large scaly heads, and such like flowers
but larger, hauing eight or nine of those hollow gaping leaues in euery flower, standing
about the middle threds (if it be planted in good and fertile ground and be well
watered, for it soone starueth and perisheth with drought) the circling leaues are of a
fine delayed purple or blush colour, very beautifull to behold; the seede of this is
smaller and blacker, and not enclosed in so much dounie substance, as the former (yet
in our Countrey the seede is not so blacke, as it came vnto vs, but more gray) the roote
perisheth likewise euery yeere.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanus Bæticus supinus.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The Spanish Corne-flower.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Spanish kinde hath many square low bending or creeping stalkes, not standing
so vpright as the former, but branching out more diuersly; so that one plant will take
vp a great deale of ground: the leaues are broader then any of the rest, softer also, of
a pale or whitish greene colour, and not much gashed on the edges: the flowers stand
in bigger heads, with foure or fiue leaues vnder euery head, and are of a light pale
purple or blush colour; after which come seede, but not so plentifully, yet wrapped in
a great deale of flockie matter, more then any: the roote groweth downe deepe into
the ground, but perisheth euery yeare as they doe.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first or former kindes, grow many times in the Corne fields of our
own Countrey, as well as of others, especially that sort with a blew flower:
but the other sorts or colours are not so frequent, but are nourished in gardens,
where they will vary wonderfully.</p>

<p>The second as is before set downe, groweth in Turkie: and the last in
Spaine, found out and first sent to vs by that industrious searcher of simples,
Guillaume Boel before remembred.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The first doe flower in the end of Iune, and in Iuly, and sometimes sooner.
The other two later, and not vntill August most commonly, and the seede
is soone ripe after.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is generally called <i>Cyanus</i>, and some following the Ditch name,
call it <i>Flos frumenti</i>. The olde Writers gaue it the name of <i>Bapti sæcuba</i>,
which is almost worne out. We doe call them in English, Blew Bottles, and
in some places, Corne flowers, after the Ditch names. The second hath
beene sent by the name of <i>Ambreboi</i>, which whether it be a Turkie or Arabian
name, I know not. I haue called it from the place, from whence we had
it, <i>Turcicus</i>, and for his beauty, <i>Floridus</i>. The Turkes themselues as I vnderstand,
doe call it The Sultans flower, and I haue done so likewise, that it
may bee distinguished from all the other kindes, or else you may call it,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>The Turkey blush Corne flower, which you please. The last was sent by
the name of <i>Iacea Bætica</i>, but I had rather to referre it to the <i>Cyanus</i>, or
Corne flowers, because the flowers are like vnto the Corne flowers, and
not vnto the Iaceas or Knapweedes.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>These had no vse in Physicke in Galen and Dioscorides time, in that (as
it is thought) they haue made no mention of them: We in these dayes doe
chiefly vse the first kindes (as also the greater sort) as a cooling Cordiall,
and commended by some to be a remedy, not onely against the plague and
pestilentiall diseases, but against the poison of Scorpions and Spiders.</p>

like in forme vnto the Corne flowers, but much larger, with many threds or
thrumes in the middle of the same colour, standing vp higher then any of the former:
this flower riseth out of a large scaly head, all set ouer with small sharpe (but harmelesse)

Spaine, where they manure it for the profit they make thereof, seruing for the dying
of Silke especially, and transporting great quantities to diuers Countries. It hath large
broad leaues, without any prickes at all vpon them in our Country, growing vpon the
stalke, which is strong, hard, and round, with shorter leaues thereon vp to the toppe,
where they are a little sharpe pointed, and prickly about the edges sometimes, which
stalke riseth three or foure foote high, and brancheth it selfe toward the toppe, bearing
at the end of euery branch one great open scaly head, out of which thrusteth out many
gold yellow threads, of a most orient shining colour, which being gathered in a dry
time, and kept dry, will abide in the same delicate colour that it bare when it was fresh,
for a very long time after: when the flowers are past, the seede when it is come to maturity,
which is very seldome with vs, is white and hard, somewhat long, round, and

one or more great and strong stalkes, three or foure foote high, without any branch at

round about the stalke, with smaller but not diuided greene leaues at euery flower,

broad, flat, thicke, round, brownish yellow seede (as I haue well obserued by them

  <span class="line">The Friers Crowne.</span>
</h4>

<p>This woolly Thistle hath many large and long leaues lying on the ground, cut in on
both sides into many diuisions, which are likewise somewhat vnequally cut in or diuided
againe, hauing sharpe white prickles at euery corner of the diuisions, of a dead
or sad greene colour on the vpperside, and somewhat woolly withall, and grayish vnderneath:
the stalke is strong and tall, foure or fiue foote high at the least, branching
out into diuers parts, euery where beset with such like leaues as growe below; at the
toppe of euery branch there breaketh out a great whitish round prickly head, flattish at
the toppe, so thicke set with wooll, that the prickles seeme but small spots or haires,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
and doth so well resemble the bald crowne of a Frier, not onely before it be in flower,
but especially after it hath done flowring, that thereupon it deseruedly receiued the
name of the Friers Crowne Thistle: out of these heads riseth forth a purple thrumme,
such as is to be seene in many other wilde Thistles, which when they are ripe, are full
of a flockie or woolly substance, which breake at the toppe shedding it, and the seede
which is blackish, flat, and smooth: the roote is great and thicke, enduring for
some yeares, yet sometimes perishing, if it be too much exposed to the violence of the
frosts in Winter.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first groweth naturally in Spaine, Italy, and France, and in many other
hot Countries, and growe onely in Gardens in these colder climates,
and there cherished for the beautifull aspect both of the greene plants, and
of the stalkes when they are in flower. The Carline Thistle is found both
in Germany and Italy in many places, and as it is reported, in some places
of the West parts in England. The others are found some in France, some
in Hungary, and on the Alpes, and the last in Spaine.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They doe all flower in the Summer moneths, some a little earlier or later
then others.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is called <i>Acanthus sativus</i> (because the other that is prickly, is
called <i>siluestris</i> or <i>spinosus</i>) and <i>Branea vrsina</i>; In English, Branck vrsine,
and Beares breech. The third is called <i>Eryngium montanum</i>, <i>Alpinum</i>, and
<i>Pannonicum latifolium</i>: In English, Mountaine or Hungary Sea Holly. The
fourth is called <i>Carduus mollis</i>, The gentle Thistle, because it hath no harmfull
prickles, although it seeme at the first shew to be a Thistle. The fifth is
called of diuers <i>Chamæleo albus</i>, and <i>Carlina</i>, as if they were both but one
plant; but Fabius Columna hath in my iudgement very learnedly descided
that controuersie, making <i>Carlina</i> to be <i>Ixine</i> of Theophrastus, and <i>Chamæleo</i>
another differing Thistle, which Gaza translateth <i>Vernilago</i>. We call it
in English, The Carline Thistle. The other haue their names in their titles,
as much as is conuenient for this discourse.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The first hath alwaies been vsed Physically, as a mollifying herbe among
others of the like slimie matter in Glisters, to open the body; yet Lobel
seemeth to make no difference in the vse of them both (that is, the prickly
as well as the smooth.) The Carline Thistle is thought to bee good against
poysons and infection. The rest are not vsed by any that I know.</p>

leaues set together, which are somewhat large and long, hard and rough in handling,
of a darkish greene colour, and of an vnpleasant strong resinous sent: the vpper parts
of the stalkes are furnished with many flowers, growing spike fashion, at certaine distances
one aboue another, consisting of fiue long leaues a peece, whereof foure that
stand on the two sides, are somewhat bending vpwards, and the fift hanging downe,
but turning vp the end of the leafe a little againe, of a faint or pale red colour, striped
through euery leafe with a deeper red colour, and hauing in the middle a tassell of fiue
or six long purplish threds, that bowe downe with the lower leafe, and turne vp also
the ends againe, with a little freese or thrume at the ends of euery one: after the flowers
are past, arise hard, stiffe, rough, clammy huskes, horned or pointed at the end, foure or
fiue standing together, somewhat like the seede vessels of the Wolfes-banes, or Colombines,
but greater, thicker and harder, wherein is contained round shining blacke
seede, greater then any Colombine seede by much, and smaller then Peony seede:
the roote is white, large, and spreading many wayes vnder ground, if it stand long: the
whole plant, as well roots as leaues and flowers, are of a strong sent, not so pleasing for

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The name <i>Fraxinella</i> is most generally imposed on those plants, because

as a difference from the <i>Dictamnus Creticus</i>, which is a farre differing plant.
Some would haue it to be <i>Tragium</i> of Dioscorides, but beside other things

Of Beanes, besides the tame or vsuall garden Beane, and the French or Kidney Beane,
(whereof I meane to entreate in my Kitchen garden, as pertinent thereto) there
is the Lupine or flat Beane, whereof I meane to entreate here, and the blacke Beane

<p>The garden Lupine riseth vp with a great round stalke, hollow and somewhat woolly,
with diuers branches, whereon grow vpon long footestalkes many broade leaues,
diuided into seuen or nine parts, or smaller leaues, equally standing round about, as it
were in a circle, of a whitish greene colour on the vpperside, and more woolly vnderneath:
the flowers stand many together at seuerall ioynts, both of the greater stalke,
and the branches, like vnto beanes, and of a white colour in some places, and in others
of a very bleake blew tending to white: after the flowers are past, there come in their
places, long, broade, and flat rough cods, wherein are contained round and flat seede,
yellowish on the inside, and couered with a tough white skin, and very bitter in taste:
the rootes are not very great, but full of small fibres, whereby it fasteneth it selfe
strongly in the ground, yet perisheth euery yeare, as all the rest of these kindes doe.</p>

  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lupinus cæruleus maximus.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The greater blew Lupine.</span>
</h5>

<p>The Stemme or stalke of this Lupine is greater then the last before recited, as also
the leaues more soft and woolly, and the flowers are of a most perfect blew colour,
with some white spots in the middle: the long rough greenish cods are very great and
large, wherein are contained hard, flat and round seede, not so white on the outside as
the former, but somewhat yellower, greater also, and more rough or hard in handling.</p>

<p>This kinde of wilde Lupine differeth not in the forme of leafe or flower from the
former, but only that it is much smaller, the leaues are greener, and haue fewer diuisions
in them: the flower is of as deepe a blew colour as the last; the cods likewise
are small and long, containing small round seede, not so flat as the former, but more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
discoloured or spotted on the outside, then the greater kinde is.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Minimus.</i></div>

  <span class="line">The yellow Lupine.</span>

<p>The yellow Lupine groweth not vsually so high, but with larger leaues then the
small blew Lupine; the flowers grow in two or three rundles or tufts, round about
the stalke and the branches at the ioynts, of a delicate fine yellow colour, like in fashion
vnto the other kindes, being larger then the last, but nothing so large as the
greater kindes, and of a fine small sent: the seede is round, and not very flat, but much about
the forme and bignesse of the small blew, or somewhat bigger, of a whitish colour
on the outside, spotted with many spots.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Place.</h5>

<p>The first groweth in many places of Greece, and the Easterne Countries
beyond it, where it hath beene anciently cherished for their foode, being
often watered to take away the bitternesse. It groweth also in these Western
parts, but still where it is planted. The great blew Lupine is thought to
come from beyond the parts of Persia, in Caramania. The lesser blew is
found very plentifully wilde, in many places both of Spaine and Italy. The
last hath beene brought vs likewise out of Spaine, whereas it is thought it
groweth naturally. They all grow now in the gardens of those, that are
curious louers of these delights.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Time.</h5>

<p>They flower in Summer, and their seede is ripe quickly after.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Names.</h5>

<p>They are generally called <i>Lupini</i>. Plautus in his time saith, they were
vsed in Comedies in stead of money, when in any Scene thereof there
was any shew of payment, and therefore he calleth them <i>Aurum Comicum</i>.
And Horace hath this Verse,</p>

<p class="noindent">to shew that counterfeit money (such as counters are with vs, or as these Lupines
were vsed in those times) was easily knowne from true and currant
coine. In English wee vsually call them after the Latine name, Lupines;
and some after the Dutch name, Figge-beanes, because they are flat and
round as a Figge that is pressed; and some Flat-beanes for the same reason.
Some haue called the yellow Lupine, Spanish Violets: but other foolish
names haue beene giuen it, as Virginia Roses, and the like, by knauish Gardiners
and others, to deceiue men, and make them beleeue they were the
finders out, or great preseruers of rarities, of no other purpose, but to
cheate men of their money: as you would therefore auoyde knaues and

in sundry places with the leaues, from betweene the branches and the leaues, at

on a long stemme or stalke, very beautifull to behold, and of a pretty sent or

<p>This is also a kinde of these Medicke fodders, hauing a trefoyle leafe and yellow
flowers like the former sorts, but both somewhat larger, the chiefest difference consisteth
in the head or fruite, which is broade and flat, and not twined like the rest, but
abideth halfe closed, resembling a halfe Moone (and thereupon hath assumed both the

<p>This red flowred Fitchling, hath many stalkes of winged faire greene leaues, that is,
of many set on both sides a middle ribbe, whereof that at the end is the greatest of
the rest: from the ioynts where the leaues stand, come forth pretty long small stalkes,
bearing on them very many flowers, vp to the toppe one aboue another, of an excellent
shining red or crimson colour, very like vnto Sattin of that colour, and sometimes
of a white colour, (as Master William Coys, a Gentleman of good respect in
Essex, a great and ancient louer and cherisher of these delights, and of all other rare
plants, in his life time assured me; he had growing in his garden at Stubbers by North
Okenden) which are somewhat large, and more closed together, almost flat and
not open, as in most of the other sorts: after the flowers are past, there come
rough, flat, round huskes, somewhat like vnto the old fashioned round bucklers without
pikes, three or foure standing one vpon or aboue another, wherein are contained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>

</h5>

<p>Vnder one description I comprehend both these sorts of Scorpions grasse, or Caterpillers,
or Wormes, as they are called by many, whereof the greater hath been known
but of late yeares; and ioyne them to these pulses, not hauing a fitter place where to
insert them. It is but a small low plant, with branches lying vpon the ground, and
somewhat long, broad, and hard leaues thereon, among which come forth small stalkes,
bearing at the end for the most part, two small pale yellowish flowers, like vnto Tares
or Vetches, but smaller, which turne into writhed or crooked tough cods; in the greater
sort they are much thicker, rounder and whiter, and lesser wound or turned together
then in the smaller, which are slenderer, more winding, yet not closing like vnto
the Snailes, and blacker more like vnto a Caterpiller then the other, wherein are
contained brownish yellow seede, much like vnto a <i>Medica</i>: the rootes of both are
small and fibrous, perishing euery yeare.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Place.</h5>

<p>These are found seuerally in diuers and seuerall places, but wee sow and
plant them vsually to furnish our Gardens.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Time.</h5>

<p>They doe all flower about the moneths of Iune and Iuly, and their seede
is ripe soone after: but the second is earlier then the rest.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Names.</h5>

<p>The first is called <i>Clymenum</i> of Matthiolus, and <i>Lathyris</i> of Lobel and others:
but <i>Lathyris</i> in Greeke is <i>Cataputia</i> in Latine, which is our Spurge,
farre differing from this Pulse; and therefore <i>Lathyrus</i> is more proper to
distinguish them asunder, that two plants so farre vnlike should not bee
called by one name: this is also called <i>Lathyrus latifolius</i>, because there
is another called <i>angustifolius</i>, that differeth from it also: It is most vsually
called with vs, <i>Pisum perenne</i>, and in English Pease blossome, or Pease euerlasting.
The second is called by Clusius, <i>Orobus venetus</i>, because it was sent
him from Venice, with another of the same kinde that bore white flowers;
yet differeth but little or nothing from that kinde he found in Hungary, that
I thinke the seuerall places of their growing only cause them to bear seuerall
names, and to be the same in deede. Although I yeeld vnto Clusius the
Latine name which doth not sufficiently content mee; yet I haue thought
good to giue it a differing English name, according as it is in the title. The
third, because I first receiued it among other seeds from Spaine, I haue giuen
it the name, as it is entituled. The fourth is called of some <i>Sandalida Cretica</i>,
&amp; <i>Lotus filiquosus flore rubello</i>, <i>Lotus tetragonolobus</i>, <i>Pisum rubrum</i>, &amp; <i>Pisum
quadratum</i>: We vsually call it in English, Crimson Pease, or square Pease.
The <i>Medica Cochleata</i> is called of Dodonæus <i>Trifolium Cochleatum</i>, but not
iudged to be the true <i>Medica</i>. Wee call it in English, Medick fodder, Snailes
Clouer, or as it is in the title, and so the rest of the Medica’s accordingly.
The <i>Hedysarum clypeatum</i> or <i>Securidaca</i> is called of Dodonæus <i>Onobrichis
altera</i>, and we in English for the likenesse, The red Sattin flower, although
some foolishly call it, the red or French Honysuckle. The last is called by
Lobel, <i>Scorpioides bupleurifolio</i>, I haue called it <i>minus</i>, because the greatest
sort which came to me out of Spaine was not knowne vnto him; in English
they are generally called Caterpillers.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Vertues.</h5>

<p>The Medica’s are generally thought to feede cattell fat much more then
the Medow Trefoile, or Clouer grasse, and therefore I haue known diuers
Gentlemen that haue plowed vp some of their pasture grounds, and sowen
them with the seedes of some Medica’s to make the experience. All the other
sorts are pleasures to delight the curious, and not any way profitable
in Physicke that I know.</p>

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are two principall kindes of Peonie, that is to say, the Male and the Female.
Of the male kinde, I haue onely known one sort, but of the Female a
great many; which are thus to be distinguished. The male his leafe is whole,
without any particular diuision, notch or dent on the edge, &amp; his rootes long &amp; round,
diuided into many branches, somewhat like to the rootes of Gentian or Elecampane,
and not tuberous at all. The Female of all sorts hath the leaues diuided or cut in on the
edges, more or lesse, and hath alwaies tuberous rootes, that is, like clogs or Asphodill
rootes, with many great thick round peeces hanging, or growing at the end of smaller
strings, and all ioyned to the toppe of the maine roote.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pæonia mas.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The Male Peonie.</span>
</h4>

<p>The Male Peonie riseth vp with many brownish stalkes, whereon doe grow winged
leaues, that is, many faire greene, and sometimes reddish leaues, one set against another
vpon a stalke, without any particular diuision in the leafe at all: the flowers stand at
the toppes of the stalkes, consisting of fiue or six broade leaues, of a faire purplish red
colour, with many yellow threds in the middle, standing about the head, which after
riseth to be the seede vessels, diuided into two, three or foure rough crooked pods like
hornes, which when they are ful ripe, open and turn themselues down one edge to another
backeward, shewing within them diuers round black shining seede, which are the
true seede, being full and good, and hauing also many red or crimson graines, which are
lancke and idle, intermixed among the blacke, as if they were good seede, whereby it
maketh a very pretty shew: the roots are great, thick and long, spreading in the ground,
and running downe reasonable deepe.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pæonia fæmina vulgaris flore simplici.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The ordinary single Female Peonie.</span>
</h4>

<p>This ordinary Female Peonie hath many stalkes, with more store of leaues on them
then the Male kinde hath, the leaues also are not so large, but diuided or nicked diuersly
on the edges, some with great and deepe, and others with smaller cuts or diuisions,
and of a darke or dead greene colour: the flowers are of a strong heady sent,
most vsually smaller then the male, and of a more purple tending to a murrey colour,
with yellow thrumes about the head in the middle, as the male kinde hath: the heads
or hornes with seed are like also but smaller, the seede also is blacke, but lesse shining:
the rootes consist, as I said, of many thicke and short tuberous clogs, fastened at the
ends of long strings, and all from the head of the roote, which is thicke and short, and
tuberous also, of the same or the like sent with the male.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pæonia fæmina vulgaris flore pleno rubro.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The double red Peonie.</span>
</h4>

<p>This double Peonie as well as the former single, is so frequent in euerie
Garden of note, through euery Countrey, that it is almost labour in vaine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
to describe it: but yet because I vse not to passe ouer any plant so slightly, I will set
down the description briefly, in regard it is so common. It is very like unto the former
single female Peony, both in stalkes and leaues, but that it groweth somewhat higher,
and the leaues are of a fresher greene colour: the flowers at the tops of the stalkes are
very large, thicke and double (no flower that I know so faire, great, and double; but
not abiding blowne aboue eight or ten daies) of a more reddish purple colour then
the former female kinde, and of a sweeter sent: after these flowers are past, sometimes
come good seed, which being sowne, bring forth some single flowers, and some double:
the rootes are tuberous, like vnto the former female.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pæonia fæmina flore carneo simplici.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The single blush Peony.</span>
</h4>

<p>The single blush Peony hath his stalkes higher, and his leaues of a paler or whiter
greene colour then the double blush, and more white vnderneath (so that it is very probable
it is of another kinde, and not risen from the seede of the double blush, as some
might thinke) with many veines, that are somewhat discoloured from the colour of
the leafe running through them: the flowers are very large and single, consisting of
fiue leaues for the most part, of a pale flesh or blush colour, with an eye of yellow dispersed
or mixed therewith, hauing many whitish threads, tipt with yellow pendents
standing about the middle head: the rootes are like the other female Peonies.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pæonia fæmina flore pleno albicante.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The double blush Peony.</span>
</h4>

<p>The double blush Peony hath not his stalkes so high as the double red, but somewhat
lower and stiffer, bearing such like winged leaues, cut in or diuided here and there
in the edges, as all these female kindes are, but not so large as the last: the flowers are
smaller, and lesse double by a good deale then the former double red, of a faint shining
crimson colour at the first opening, but decaying or waxing paler euery day: so that
after it hath stood long (for this flower sheddeth not his leaues in a great while) it will
change somewhat whitish; and therefore diuers haue ignorantly called it, the double
white Peony: the seedes, which sometimes it beareth, and rootes, are like vnto the
former female kindes, but somewhat longer, and of a brighter colour on the outside.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">6. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pæonia fæmina Byzantina.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The single red Peony of Constantinople.</span>
</h4>

<p>This red Peony of Constantinople is very like in all things vnto the double red Peonie,
but that the flowers hereof are single, and as large as the last, and that is larger
then either the single female, or the male kinde, consisting of eight leaues, of a deeper
red colour then either the single or double Peonies, and not purplish at all, but rather
of the colour of an ordinary red Tulipa, standing close and round together: the roots
of this kinde haue longer clogs, and not so short as of the ordinary female kinde, and
of a paler colour on the outside.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>All these Peonies haue beene sent or brought from diuers parts beyond
the Seas; they are endenized in our Gardens, where wee cherish them for
the beauty and delight of their goodly flowers, as well as for their Physicall
vertues.</p>
</div>

<p>The name <i>Pæonia</i> is of all the later Writers generally giuen to these
plants, although they haue had diuers other names giuen by the elder Writers,
as <i>Rosa fatuina</i>, <i>Idæus dactylus</i>, <i>Aglaophotis</i>, and others, whereof to set
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>downe the causes, reasons, and errours, were to spend more time then I intend

them according to their titles.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The male Peony roote is farre aboue all the rest a most singular approued
remedy for all Epilepticall diseases, in English, The falling sicknesse
(and more especially the greene roote then the dry) if the disease be not too
inueterate, to be boyled and drunke, as also to hang about the neckes of the
younger sort that are troubled herewith, as I haue found it sufficiently experimented
on many by diuers. The seede likewise is of especiall vse for women,
for the rising of the mother. The seede of the female kinde, as well
as the rootes, are most vsually sold, and may in want of the other be (and
so are generally) vsed.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are three sorts of blacke Hellebor or Beares foote, one that is the true and
right kinde, whose flowers haue the most beautifull aspect, and the time of his
flowring most rare, that is, in the deepe of Winter about Christmas, when no
other can bee seene vpon the ground: and two other that are wilde or bastard kindes,
brought into many Gardens for their Physicall properties; but I will only ioyne one
of them with the true kinde in this worke, and leaue the other for another.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helleborus niger verus.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The true blacke Hellebor,
or Christmas flower.</span>
</h4>

<p>The true blacke Hellebor (or Beare foote as some would call it, but that name doth
more fitly agree with the other two bastard kindes) hath many faire greene leaues rising
from the roote, each of them standing on a thicke round fleshly stiffe greene stalke,
about an hand breadth high from the ground, diuided into seuen, eight, or nine parts
or leaues, and each of them nicked or dented, from the middle of the leafe to the pointward
on both sides, abiding all the Winter, at which time the flowers rise vp on such
short thicke stalkes as the leaues stand on, euery one by it selfe, without any leafe
thereon for the most part, or very seldome hauing one small short leafe not much vnder
the flower, and very little higher then the leaues themselues, consisting of fiue
broad white leaues, like vnto a great white single Rose (which sometimes change to
be either lesse or more purple about the edges, as the weather or time of continuance
doth effect) with many pale yellow thrummes in the middle, standing about a greene
head, which after groweth to haue diuers cods set together, pointed at the ends like
hornes, somewhat like the seede vessels of the <i>Aconitum hyemale</i>, but greater &amp; thicker,
wherein is contained long, round, and blackish seede, like the seede of the bastard
kindes: the rootes are a number of brownish strings running downe deepe into the
ground, and fastened to a thicke head, of the bignesse of a finger at the toppe manie
times, and smaller still downewards.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helleboraster minor.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The lesser bastard blacke Hellebor, or Beare foote.</span>
</h4>

<p>The smaller Beare foote is in most things like vnto the former true blacke Hellebor;
for it beareth also many leaues vpon short stalkes, diuided into many leaues also, but
each of them are long and narrow, of a blacker greene colour, snipt or dented on both
edges, which feele somewhat hard or sharpe like prickes, and perish euery yeare, but
rise againe the next Spring: the flowers hereof stand on higher stalkes, with some
leaues on them also, although but very few, and are of a pale, greene colour, like in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
forme vnto the flowers of the former, but smaller, hauing also many greenish yellow
threads or thrums in the middle, and such like heads or seede vessels, and blackish seed:
the rootes are stringie and blackish like the former.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first groweth onely in the Gardens of those that are curious, and delight
in all sorts of beautifull flowers in our Countrey, but wilde in many
places of Germany, Italy, Greece, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>The other groweth wilde in many places of England, as well as the other
greater sort, which is not here described; for besides diuers places within
eight or ten miles from London, I haue seen it in the Woods of Northamptonshire,
and in other places.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The first of these plants doth flower in the end of December, and beginning
of Ianuary most vsually, and the other a moneth or two after, and
sometime more.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is called <i>Helleborus</i>, or <i>Elleborus niger verus</i>, and is the same that
both Theophrastus and Dioscorides haue written of, and which was called
<i>Melampodion</i>, of Melampus the Goateheard, that purged and cured the mad
or melancholicke daughters of Prætus with the rootes thereof. Dodonæus
calleth it <i>Veratrum nigrum primum</i>, and the other <i>secundum</i>: Wee call it in
English, The true blacke Hellebor, or the Christmas flower, because (as I
said) it is most commonly in flower at or before Christmas. The second is
a bastard or wilde kinde thereof, it so nearely resembleth the true, and is
called of most of the later Writers, <i>Pseudoelleborus niger minor</i>, or <i>Helleboraster
minor</i>, for a distinction betweene it and the greater, which is not here
described: and is called in English, The smaller or lesser Beare foote, and
most vsed in Physicke, because it is more plentifull, yet it is more churlish and
strong in operation then the true or former kinde.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The rootes of both these kindes are safe medecines, being rightly prepared,
to be vsed for all Melancholicke diseases, whatsoeuer others may feare
or write, and may be without danger applied, so as care and skill, and not
temerary rashnesse doe order and dispose of them.</p>

<p>The powder of the dryed leaues, especially of the bastard kinde, is a sure
remedy to kill the wormes in children, moderately taken.</p>

<p>The first great white Ellebor riseth at the first out of the ground, with a whitish
greene great round head, which growing vp, openeth it selfe into many goodly faire
large greene leaues, plaited or ribbed with eminent ribbes all along the leaues, compassing
one another at the bottome, in the middle whereof riseth vp a stalke three foot
high or better, with diuers such like leaues thereon, but smaller to the middle thereof;
from whence to the toppe it is diuided into many branches, hauing many small yellowish,
or whitish greene starre-like flowers all along vpon them, which after turne
into small, long, three square whitish seede, standing naked, without any huske to containe
them, although some haue written otherwise: the roote is thicke and reasonable

or larger, and doe sooner perish and fall away from the plant: the stalke hereof is as
high as the former, bearing such like starry flowers, but of a darke or blackish red colour:
the seede is like the other: the roote hath no such head as the other (so farre as I
haue obserued, both by mine own and others plants) but hath many long white strings

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is called <i>Elleborus albus</i>, or <i>Helleborus albus</i>, the letter <i>H</i>, as all
Schollers know, being but <i>aspirationis nota</i>: and <i>Veratrum album flore viridante</i>,
of some <i>Sanguis Herculis</i>. The other is called <i>Elleborus albus præcox</i>,
and <i>flore atrorubente</i>, or <i>atropurpurante</i>. We call the first in English, White
Ellebor, Neesewort, or Neesing roote, because the powder of the roote is
vsed to procure neesing; and I call it the greater, in regard of those in the
<a href="#Chap_2_LXXXIII" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 83">next Chapter</a>. The other hath his name according to the Latine title, most
proper for it.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The force of purging is farre greater in the roote of this Ellebor, then in
the former; and therefore is not carelessly to bee vsed, without extreame
danger; yet in contumatious and stubborne diseases it may bee vsed with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>good caution and aduice. There is a Syrupe or Oxymel made hereof in the
Apothecaries shops, which as it is dangerous for gentle and tender bodies,
so it may be very effectuall in stronger constitutions. Pausanias <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>in Phocicis</cite></i>,
recordeth a notable stratagem that Solon vsed in besieging the Citie of
Cirrheus, <i>viz.</i> That hauing cut off the riuer Plistus from running into the
Citie, he caused a great many of these rootes to be put into a quantity thereof,
which after they had steeped long enough therein, and was sufficiently
infected therewith, he let passe into the Citie againe: whereof when they
had greedily drunke, they grew so weake and feeble by the superpurgation
thereof, that they were forced to leaue their wals vnmand, and not guarded,
whereby the Amphyctions their enemies became masters of their Citie.
The like stratagems are set downe by diuers other Authors, performed by
the helpe of other herbes.</p>

whereof there are found many sorts: One which is the greater kinde, is of greatest
beauty; the other which are lesser differ not much one from another, more then in the

<p>This most beautifull plant of all these kindes, riseth vp with diuers stalkes, a foote
and a halfe high at the most, bearing on each side of them broad greene leaues, somewhat
like in forme vnto the leaues of the white Ellebor, but smaller and not so ribbed,
compassing the stalke at the lower end; at the tops of the stalkes come forth one, or
two, or three flowers at the most, one aboue another, vpon small short foote-stalkes,
with a small leafe at the foote of euery stalke: each of these flowers are of a long ouall
forme, that is, more long then round, and hollow withall, especially at the vpper part,
the lower being round and swelling like a belly: at the hollow part there are two small
peeces like eares or flippets, that at the first doe couer the hollow part, and after stand
apart one from another, all which are of a fine pale yellow colour, in all that I haue
seene (yet it is said there are some found, that are more browne or tending to purple)
there are likewise foure long, narrow, darke coloured leaues at the setting on of the
flower vnto the stalke, wherein as it were the flower at the first standeth: the whole
flower is of a pretty small sent: the seede is very small, very like vnto the seede of the
<i>Orchides</i> or Satyrions, and contained in such like long pods, but bigger: the roots are
composed of a number of strings enterlacing themselues one within another, lying
within the vpper crust of the earth, &amp; not spreading deep, of a darke brownish colour.</p>

<p>This smaller wilde white Ellebor riseth vp in the like manner vnto the former, and
not much lower, bearing such like leaues, but smaller, and of a winter greene colour,
almost of the colour and fashion of the leaues of Lilly Conually; the top of the stalke
hath many more flowers, but lesser, growing together, spike-fashion, with small short
leaues at the stalke of euery flower, which consisteth of fiue small white leaues, with a
small close hood in the middle, without any sent at all; the seede and seede vessels are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>

<p>The leaues of this kinde are like vnto the last described, but somewhat narrower:
the stalkes and flowers are alike, but smaller also, and of a pale purplish or blush colour,
which causeth the difference.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first groweth in very many places of Germany, and in other Countries
also. It groweth likewise in Lancashire, neare vpon the border of
Yorkeshire, in a wood or place called the Helkes, which is three miles from
Ingleborough, the highest Hill in England, and not farre from Ingleton, as
I am informed by a courteous Gentlewoman, a great louer of these delights,
called Mistris Thomasin Tunstall, who dwelleth at Bull-banke,
neare Hornby Castle in those parts, and who hath often sent mee vp the
rootes to London, which haue borne faire flowers in my Garden. The Second
groweth in many places of England, and with the same Gentlewoman
also before remembred, who sent me one plant of this kinde with the other.
The last I haue not yet knowne to growe in England; but no doubt many
things doe lye hid, and not obserued, which in time may bee discouered, if
our Country Gentlemen and women, and others, in their seuerall places
where they dwell, would be more carefull and diligent, and be aduertised
either by themselues, or by others capable and fit to be imployed, as occasion
and time might serue, to finde out such plants as growe in any the circuits
or limits of their habitations, or in their trauels, as their pleasures or
affaires leade them. And because ignorance is the chiefe cause of neglect
of many rare things, which happen to their view at sometimes, which are
not to be seene againe peraduenture, or not in many yeares after, I would
heartily aduise all men of meanes, to be stirred vp to bend their mindes, and
spend a little more time and trauell in these delights of herbes and flowers,
then they haue formerly done, which are not onely harmlesse, but pleasurable
in their time, and profitable in their vse. And if any would be better
enformed, and certified of such things they know not, I would be willing
and ready to my best skill to aduertise them, that shall send any thing vp to
me where I dwell in London. Thus farre I haue digressed from the matter
in hand, and yet not without some good vse I hope, that others may make
of it.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The two first flower earlier then the last, and both the first about one
time, that is, in the end of Aprill, or beginning of May. The last in the
end of May, or in Iune.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is called <i>Elleborine recentiorum maior</i>, and <i>Calceolus Mariæ</i>: Of
some thought to be <i>Cosmosandalos</i>, because it is <i>Sandali forma</i>. In English we
call it our Ladies Slipper, after the Dutch name. The other two lesser kinds
haue their names in their titles: I haue thought it fit to adde the title of small
white Ellebors vnto these, for the forme sake, as is before said.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e remembrance of the Conuall Lilly, spoken of in the <a href="#Chap_2_LXXXIIIa" title="go to small white Ellebor in Pleasant Flowers Chapter 83">precedent Chapter</a>,
hath caused me to insert these plants among the rest, although differing both
in face and properties; but lest it should lose all place, let it keepe this. It is of
two sorts, differing chiefly in the colour of the flowers, the one being white, and the
other reddish, as shall be shewed in their descriptions following.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lilium Conuallium flore albo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The white Lilly Conually.</span>
</h4>

<p>The white Conuall or May Lilly, hath three or foure leaues rising together from
the roote, one enclosed within another, each whereof when it is open is long and
broad, of a grayish shining greene colour, somewhat resembling the leaues of the former
wilde Neesewort, at the side whereof, and sometime from the middle of them,
riseth vp a small short naked foote-stalke, an hand breadth high or somewhat more,
bearing at the toppe one aboue another many small white flowers, like little hollow
bottles with open mouths, nicked or cut into fiue or six notches, turning all downewards
one way, or on one side of the stalke, of a very strong sweete sent, and comfortable
for the memory and senses, which turne into small red berries, like vnto Asparagus,
wherein is contained hard white seede: the rootes runne vnder ground, creeping
euery way, consisting of many small white strings.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lilium Conuallium flore rubente.</i></span>
  <span class="line">May Lillies with red flowers.</span>
</h4>

<p>This other May Lilly differeth neither in roote, leafe, nor forme of flower from that
before, but onely in the colour of the flower, which is of a fine pale red colour, being
in my iudgement not altogether so sweet as the former.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first groweth aboundantly in many places of England. The other is
a stranger, and groweth only in the Gardens of those that are curious louers
of rarities.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They both flower in May, and the berries are ripe in August.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The Latines haue no other name for this plant but <i>Lilium Conuallium</i>, although
some would haue it to be <i>Lilium vernum</i> of Theophrastus, and others
<i>Oenanthe</i> of the same Author. Gesner thinketh it to be <i>Callionymus</i>.
Lonicerus to be <i>Cacalia</i>, and Fuchsius to be <i>Ephemerum non lethale</i>: but they
are all for the most part mistaken. We call it in English Lilly Conually, May
Lilly, and of some Liriconfancie.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The flowers of the white kinde are often vsed with those things that help
to strengthen the memory, and to procure ease to Apoplecticke persons.
Camerarius setteth downe the manner of making an oyle of the flowers
hereof, which he saith is very effectuall to ease the paines of the Goute, and
such like diseases, to be vsed outwardly, which is thus: Hauing filled a glasse
with the flowers, and being well stopped, set it for a moneths space in an
Ants hill, and after being drayned cleare, set it by to vse.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are diuers sorts of Gentians or Fell-wortes, some greater, others lesser,
and some very small; many of them haue very beautifull flowers, but because
some are very suddenly past, before one would thinke they were blowne open,
and others will abide no culture and manuring, I will onely set forth vnto you two of
the greater sorts, and three of the lesser kindes, as fittest, and more familiarly furnishing
our gardens, leauing the rest to their wilde habitations, and to bee comprehended
in a generall Worke.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gentiana maior flore flauo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The great Gentian.</span>
</h4>

<p>The great Gentian riseth vp at the first, with a long, round and pointed head of
leaues, closing one another, which after opening themselues, lye vpon the ground,
and are faire, long and broad, somewhat plaited or ribbed like vnto the leaues of white
Ellebor or Neeseworte, but not so fairely or eminently plaited, neyther so stiffe, but
rather resembling the leaues of a great Plantane: from among which riseth vp a stiffe
round stalke, three foote high or better, full of ioynts, hauing two such leaues, but
narrower and smaller at euery ioynt, so compassing about the stalke at the lower end
of them, that they will almost hold water that falleth into them: from the middle of
the stalke to the toppe, it is garnished with many coronets or rundles of flowers, with
two such greene leaues likewise at euery ioynt, and wherein the flowers doe stand,
which are yellow, layd open like starres, and rising out of small greenish huskes, with
some threds in the middle of them, but of no sent at all, yet stately to behold, both
for the order, height and proportion of the plant: the seede is browne and flat, contained
in round heads, somewhat like vnto the seede of the <i>Fritillaria</i>, or checkerd
Daffodill, but browner: the rootes are great, thicke and long, yellow, and exceeding
bitter.</p>

  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gentiana maior folio Asclepiadis.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Swallow-wort Gentian.</span>
</h4>

<p>This kinde of Gentian hath many stalkes rising from the roote, neere two foote
high, whereon grow many faire pale greene leaues, set by couples, with three ribs in
euery one of them, and doe somewhat resemble the leaues of <i>Asclepias</i> or Swallow-wort,
that is, broade at the bottome, and sharpe at the point: the flowers grow at the
seuerall ioynts of the stalkes, from the middle vpwards, two or three together, which
are long and hollow, like vnto a bell flower, ending in fiue corners, or pointed leaues,
and folded before they are open, as the flowers of the Bindeweedes are, of a faire
blew colour, sometimes deeper, and sometimes paler: the heads or seede vessels haue
two points or hornes at the toppes, and containe within them flat grayish seed, like vnto
the former, but lesse: the rootes hereof are nothing so great as the former, but are
yellow, small and long, of the bignesse of a mans thumbe.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gentiana minor Cruciata.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Crosse-wort Gentian.</span>

<p>This small Gentian hath many branches lying vpon the ground, scarce lifting themselues
vpright, and full of ioynts, whereat grow vsually foure leaues, one opposite
vnto another, in manner of a Crosse, from whence it tooke his name, in shape very like
vnto <i>Saponaria</i> or Sopewort, but shorter, and of a darker greene colour: at the tops of
the stalkes stand many flowers, thick thrusting together, and likewise at the next ioynt
vnderneath, euery one of them standing in a darke blewish greene huske, and consisting
of fiue small leaues, the points or ends whereof only appeare aboue the huskes
wherein they stand, and are hardly to be seene, but that they are of a fine pale blew colour,
and that many grow together: the seed is small and brown, hard, and somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>

  <span class="line">Small Gentian of the Spring.</span>
</h4>

<p>The small Gentian of the Spring hath diuers small hard greene leaues, lying vpon
the ground, as it were in heads or tufts, somewhat broade below, and pointed at the
end, with fiue ribs or veines therein, as conspicuous as in the former Gentians, among
which riseth vp a small short stalke, with some smaller leaues thereon, at the toppe
whereof standeth one faire, large, hollow flower, made bell fashion, with wide open
brimmes, ending in fiue corners or diuisions, of the most excellent deepe blew colour
that can be seene in any flower, with some white spots in the bottome on the inside:
after the flower is past, there appeare long and round pods, wherein are contained
small blackish seede: the rootes are small, long, pale yellow strings, which shoot forth
here and there diuers heads of leaues, and thereby encrease reasonable well, if it finde
a fit place, and ground to grow, or else will not be noursed vp, with all the care and diligence
can be vsed: the whole plant is bitter, but not so strong as the former.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gentiana Autumnalis siue Pneumonanthe.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Calathian Violet or Autumne Gentian.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Gentian that flowreth in Autumne, hath in some places higher stalkes then in
others, with many leaues thereon, set by couples as in other Gentians, but long and
narrow, yet shewing the three ribbes or veines that are in each of them: the toppes of
the stalkes are furnished euery one with a flower or two, of an excellent blew purple
colour, ending in fiue corners, and standing in long huskes: the rootes are somewhat
great at the top, and spreading into many small yellow strings, bitter as the rest are.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">6. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saponaria flore duplici.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Double flowred Sopeworte.</span>
</h4>

<p>Vnto these kindes of Gentians, I must needes adde these following plants, for that
the former is of some neere resemblance in leafe with some of the former. And because
the ordinary Sopeworte or Bruiseworte with single flowers is often planted in
Gardens, and the flowers serue to decke both the garden and the house; I may vnder
the one describe them both: for this with double flowers is farre more rare, and of
greater beautie. It hath many long and slender round stalkes, scarce able to sustaine
themselues, and stand vpright, being ful of ioynts and ribbed leaues at them, euery one
somewhat like a small Gentian or Plantane leafe: at the toppes of the stalkes stand
many flowers, consisting of two or three rowes of leaues, of a whitish or pale purple
colour, and of a strong sweet sent, somewhat like the smell of Iasmin flowers, standing
in long and thicke pale greene huskes, which fall away without giuing any seede, as
most other double flowers doe that encrease by the roote, which spreadeth within the
ground, and riseth vp in sundry distant places like the single.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">7. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plantago Rosea.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Rose Plantane.</span>
</h4>

<p>This other plant is in all things like vnto the ordinary Plantane or Ribworte, that
groweth wilde abroade in many places, whose leaues are very large: but instead of
the long slender spike, or eare that the ordinary hath, this hath eyther a thicke long
spike of small greene leaues vpon short stalkes, or else a number of such small greene
leaues layd round-wise like vnto a Rose, and sometimes both these may be seene vpon
one and the same roote, at one and the same time, which abide a great while fresh vpon
the roote, and sometimes also giueth seede, especially from the more long and slender
spikes.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>Some of these Gentians grow on the toppes of hils, and some on the sides
and foote of them in Germany and other Countreyes: some of them also
vpon barren heaths in those places, as also in our owne Countrey, especial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>ly
the Autumne Gentian, and as it is reported, the Vernall likewise. The
single or ordinary Sopeworte is found wilde in many places with vs, but
the double came to vs from beyond the Sea, and is scarce known or heard
of in England. The Rose Plantaine hath beene long in England, but whether
naturall thereof or no, I am not assured.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower for the most part in Iune and Iuly, but the small Gentian of
the Spring flowreth somewhat earlier, and that of the Autumne in August
and September.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p><i>Gentiana</i> is the generall name giuen to the Gentians. We call them in English
Gentian, Fellworte, Bitterwort, and Baldmoney. <i>Saponaria</i> taketh his
name from the scouring qualitie it hath: Wee call it in English Sopewort,
and in some places Bruisewort. Some haue thought it to bee <i>Struthium</i> of
Dioscorides, or at least haue vsed it for the same causes, but therein they
are greatly deceiued, as Matthiolus hath very well obserued thereon, and
so is Dodonæus, that thought it to be <i>Alisma</i>. The Rose Plantaine is so called
of the double spikes it carrieth.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The wonderfull wholsomnesse of Gentian cannot bee easily knowne to
vs, by reason our daintie tastes refuse to take thereof, for the bitternesse
sake: but otherwise it would vndoubtedly worke admirable cures, both
for the liuer, stomacke and lunges. It is also a speciall counterpoison against
any infection, as also against the violence of a mad dogges tooth: wilde
Sopewort is vsed in many places, to scoure the countrey womens treen, and
pewter vessels, and physically some make great boast to performe admirable
cures in Hydropicall diseases, because it is diureticall, and in <i>Lue Veneria</i>,
when other Mercuriall medicines haue failed. The Rose Plantaine no
doubt hath the same qualities that the ordinary hath.</p>

<p>The Peach-leafed Bell-flower hath many tufts, or branches of leaues lying vpon the
ground, which are long and narrow, somewhat like vnto the leafe of an Almond or
Peach tree, being finely nicked about the edges, and of a sad greene colour, from among
which rise vp diuers stalkes, two foote high or more, set with leaues to the middle,
and from thence vpwards, with many flowers standing on seuerall small foote-stalkes,
one aboue another, with a small leafe at the foote of euery one; the flowers
stand in small greene huskes, being small and round at the bottome, but wider open at
the brimme, and ending in fiue corners, with a three forked clapper in the middle, set
about with some small threds tipt with yellow, which flowers in some plants are pure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
white, and in others of a pale blew or watchet colour, hauing little or no sent at all:
the seede is small, and contained in round flat heads, or seede vessels: the roote is very
small, white and threddy, creeping vnder the vpper crust of the ground, so that oftentimes
the heat and drought of the Summer will goe near to parch and wither it vtterly:
it requireth therefore to be planted in some shadowie place.</p>

<p>This great Bell-flower hath diuers stalkes, three foote high or better, whereon grow
diuers smooth, darke, greene leaues, broade at the bottome, and small at the point,
somewhat vneuenly notched about the edges, and standing vpon longer footestalkes

whence come large, round, hollow Bels, swelling out in the middle, and rising somewhat
aboue it, like the necke of a pot, and then ending in fiue corners, which are either
of a faire or faint white, or of a pale blew purplish colour, and sometimes of a deeper
purple or violet: after the flowers are past, there rise vp great square, or cornered seede
vessels, wherein is contained in diuers diuisions, small, hard, shining, browne, flat seeds:
the roote is white, and being young as in the first yeares sowing, is tender, and often

somewhat like vnto Nettle leaues, being broad and round at the bottome, and pointed
at the end, notched or dented on the edges, and euery one standing on a long footstalk:
among these leaues rise vp diuers square rough stalkes, diuided at the toppe into diuers

the roote is hard and white, dispersing it selfe into many branches vnder ground,
not perishing euery yeare as the former (although it loseth all the leaues in winter) but

<p>This Bell-flower, although it hath a Gigantine name, yet did I neuer perceiue it in

only giuen for difference sake: the leaues whereof are not so rough, but as large, and
dented about the edges, somewhat larger pointed, and of a fresher greene colour: the
stalkes beare such like leaues on them, but more thinly or dispersedly set, hauing a

somewhat like the great Throateworte in forme, but of a pale or bleake reddish purple

wormes: the roote is great, thicke and white, abiding long without perishing.</p>

one at the foote of euery of them also, the toppes whereof doe end in a great large
tuft of flowers, with a small greene leafe at the foote of the stalke of euery flower,
each footestalke being about an inch long, bearing a round greene huske, diuided into
fiue long leaues or points turned downwards, and in the midst of euery of them a most

of a little paler colour then the flower, but of no sent or smell at all, commendable only
for the great bush of so orient red crimson flowers: after the flowers are past, the

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>All these Bell-flowers do grow in our Gardens, where they are cherished
for the beautie of their flowers. The Couentry Bels doe not grow wilde in
any of the parts about Couentry, as I am credibly informed by a faithfull
Apothecary dwelling there, called Master Brian Ball, but are noursed in
Gardens with them, as they are in other places. The last groweth neere the
riuer of Canada, where the French plantation in America is seated.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower from May vntill the end of Iuly or August, and in the mean
time the seed is ripe: But the Peache-leafed Bell-flowers, for the most part,
flower earlier then the other.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is generally called <i>Campanula Perficifolia</i>, in English Peach-leafed
Bell-flower. The second is called <i>Campanula maior</i>, <i>Campanula lactescens Pyramidalis</i>,
and <i>Pyramidalis Lutetiana</i> of Lobel, in English, Great or Steeple
Bell-flower. The third is vsually called <i>Viola Mariana</i>, and of some <i>Viola
Marina</i>. Lobel putteth a doubt whether it be not <i>Medium</i> of Dioscorides,
as Matthiolus and others doe thinke; but in my opinion the thicknesse of
the roote, as the text hath it, contradicteth all the rest. We call it generally
in English Couentry Bels. Some call it Marian, and some Mercuries Violets.
The fourth and fift are called <i>Trachelium</i> or <i>Cervicaria</i>, of some <i>Vvularia</i>,
because many haue vsed it to good purpose, for the paines of the <i>Vvula</i>, or
Throate: Yet there is another plant, called also by some <i>Vvularia</i>, which
is <i>Hippoglossum</i>, Horse tongue, or Double tongue. The sixt hath his title to
descipher it out sufficiently, as is declared. The seuenth is called <i>Trachelium
minus</i>, and <i>Ceruicaria minor</i>, of some <i>Saponaria altera</i>; in English, Small
Throateworte, or Small Canterbury Bels. The last hath his name in the title,
as it is called in France, from whence I receiued plants for my Garden
with the Latine name: but I haue giuen it in English.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The Peach-Bels as well as the others may safely bee vsed in gargles and
lotions for the mouth, throate, or other parts, as occasion serueth. The
rootes of many of them, while they are young, are often eaten in sallets
by diuers beyond the Seas.</p>

  <span class="line">The greater blew Bindweede, or Bell-flower with round leaues.</span>
</h4>

<p>This goodly plant riseth vp with many long and winding branches, whereby it
climbeth and windeth vpon any poles, herbes, or trees, that stand neare it within a
great compasse, alwaies winding it selfe contrary to the course of the Sunne: on these
branches doe growe many faire great round leaues, and pointed at the end, like vnto a
Violet leafe in shape, but much greater, of a sad greene colour: at the ioynts of the
branches, where the leaues are set, come forth flowers on pretty long stalkes, two or
three together at a place, which are long, and pointed almost like a finger, while they
are buds, and not blowne open, and of a pale whitish blew colour, but being blowne
open, are great and large bels, with broad open mouths or brims ending in fine corners,
and small at the bottome, standing in small greene huskes of fine leaues: these
flowers are of a very deepe azure or blew colour, tending to a purple, very glorious to
behold, opening for the most part in the euening, abiding so all the night and the next
morning, vntill the Sunne begin to growe somewhat hot vpon them, and then doe
close, neuer opening more: the plant carrieth so many flowers, if it stand in a warme
place, that it will be replenished plentifully, vntill the cold ayres and euenings stay
the luxury thereof: after the flowers are past, the stalkes whereon the flowers did
stand, bend downwards, and beare within the huskes three or foure blacke seedes, of
the bignesse of a Tare or thereabouts: the rootes are stringy, and perish euery yeare.</p>

<p>The growing and forme of this Bindeweede or Bell-flower, is all one with the former,

<p>Although this rare plant (because wee seldome haue it, and can as hardly keepe it)
be scarce knowne in these cold Countries, yet I could not but make mention of it, to
incite those that haue conueniencie to keepe it, to be furnished of it. It springeth vp
at the first from the seede with two leaues, with two long forked ends, which abide a
long time before they perish, betweene which riseth vp the stalke or stemme, branching
forth diuers waies, being of a brownish colour, which windeth it selfe as the
former great Bell-flower doth, whereon are set at seuerall ioynts diuers winged leaues,
that is to say, many small narrow and long leaues set on both sides of the middle ribbe,
and one at the end: from these ioynts arise long stalkes, at the ends whereof stand two
or three small, long, hollow flowers, fashioned very like vnto the flowers of a Bindeweede,
or the flowers of Tabacco, and ending in the like manner in fiue points, but
not so much laide open, being of a bright red colour, plaited as the Bindeweedes or
Bell-flowers before they be open, with some few threads in the middle, which turne
into long pointed cods, wherein is contained long and blacke seede, tasting hot like
Pepper: the roote is small and stringy, perishing euery yeare, and with vs will seldome
come to flower, because our cold nights and frosts come so soone, before it can

euery where wilde on the bankes of fields abroad) set vpon the small trayling branches,
which growe aboue two or three foote high: from the middle of these branches,

leaues, folded together at the first into fiue plaites, which open into so many corners,
of a most excellent faire skie coloured blew (so pleasant to behold, that often it amazeth
the spectator) with white bottomes, and yellowish in the middle, which turne
into small round white heads, wherein are contained small blackish cornered seede,
somewhat like the former, but smaller: the roote is small and threddy, perishing as
the former euery yeare: this neuer windeth it selfe about any thing, but leaneth by
reason of the weaknesse of the branches, and dyeth euery yeare after seede time, and
not to be sowne againe vntill the next Spring.</p>

<p>This small purple Bindeweede, where it naturally groweth, is rather a plague then
a pleasure, to whatsoeuer groweth with it in the fields; yet the beauty of the flower
hath caused it to be receiued into Gardens, bearing longer and smaller leaues then the
last, and such like small Bell-flowers, but of a sad purple colour: the roote is liuing,
as the common kinds are, and springeth againe where it hath been once sowne, without
feare of perishing.</p>

<p>The first two greater kindes haue beene sent vs out of Italy, but whether
they had them from the East Indies, or from some of the Easterne Countries
on this side, wee know not: but they thriue reasonable well in our
Country, if the yeare be any thing kindly. The next came out of America,
as his name testifieth. The lesser blew kinde groweth naturally in many
places both of Spaine and Portugall (from whence I first receiued seedes
from Guillaume Boel, heretofore remembred.) The last groweth wilde in
the fields, about Dunmowe in Essex, and in many other places of our
owne Countrey likewise.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The three first greater kindes flower not vntill the end of August, or
thereabouts, and the seede ripeneth in September, if the colds and frosts
come not on too speedily. The lesser kindes flower in Iune and Iuly.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is called of some <i>Campana Lazura</i>, as the Italians doe call it, or
<i>Campana cærulea</i>, of others <i>Convolvulus cæruleus maior</i>, <i>siue Indicus</i>, and <i>Flos
noctis</i>. Of some <i>Nil Auicennæ</i>. The second, is called <i>Convolvulus trifolius</i>,
or <i>hederaceus</i>, for the distinction of the leaues. In English wee call them eyther
Great blew Bell flowers, or more vsually, Great blew Bindeweedes.
That of America is diuersly called by diuers. It is called <i>Quamoclit</i> of the
Indians, and by that name it was sent to Ioachinus Camerarius out of Italy,
where it is so called still, as Fabius Columna setteth it downe, and as my
selfe also can witnesse it, from thence being so sent vnto mee: but Andræas
Cæsalpinus calleth it, <i>Iasminum folio Millefolij</i>, supposing it to be a Iasmine.
Camerarius saith, it may not vnfitly be called <i>Convolvulus tenuifolius</i>, accounting
it a kinde of Bindeweede. Columna entituleth it <i>Convolvulus pennatus
exoticus rarior</i>, and saith it cannot bee referred to any other kinde of
plant then to the Bindeweede. Hee that published the <i>Curæ posteriores</i> of
Clusius, giueth it the name of <i>Iasminum Americanum</i>, which I would doe
also, if I thought it might belong to that Family; but seeing the face and
forme of the plant better agreeing with the Bindeweedes or Bell-flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
I haue (as you see) inserted it among them, and giuen it that name may bee
most fit for it, especially because it is but an annuall plant. The lesser kindes
haue their names sufficiently expressed in their titles.</p>

after the flowers are past, come the fruit, which are thorny long heads, more prickly

about the edges, with many ribs, and smaller veines running through them, yet lesser
by much then the greater kinde: at the ioynts where the leaues stand, come forth
long and large white flowers, with broad or wide open brims, folded together before
their opening, as the other former Bell-flowers or Bindeweedes, but hauing their fiue

the flowers are past, succeed small fruit, rounder and harder, set with harder, but
blunt prickes then the former, wherein is contained brownish yellow flat seede,
sticking to the inward pulpe; the roote is not very great, but full of strings, and
quickly perisheth with the first frosts.</p>

</h4>

<p>In the flower of this plant, consisteth the chiefest difference from the former, which
is as large as the last, pointed into more hornes or corners, and beareth two flowers,
standing in one huske, one of them rising out from the middle of the other, like vnto
those kindes of Cowslips and Oxelips, called double, or Hose in hose, before described,
which are of a pale purplish colour on the outside, and almost white within: the
fruit is round like the last, and beareth such like seede, so that vntill it bee in flower,
their difference can hardly bee discerned: this is more tender then the last, although
euen it is so tender, that it seldome beareth ripe seede with vs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flore duplici.</i></div>

<p>Sometimes (for I think it is not another kind) the flower will haue as it were double
rowes of leaues, close set together, and not consisting of two, rising so distinctly one
aboue another.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>All these kindes haue been brought or sent vs out of Turkie and Egypt;
but Garcias, and Christopherus Acosta, with others, affirme that they grow
in the East Indies. The lesser kindes are very rare with vs, because they seldome
come to maturity; and therefore we are still to seeke of new seede to
sowe. The greater kindes are plentifull enough in our Gardens, and will
well abide, and giue ripe fruit.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The smaller kindes flower later then the greater; and therefore their
fruit are the sooner spoyled with the cold ayres, dewes, and frosts, that
come at the latter end of the yeare: but the greater kinds neuer misse lightly
to ripen.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>Both the greater and smaller kindes are generally called <i>Stramonium</i>,
<i>Stramonia</i>, <i>Pomum spinosum</i>, and <i>Datura</i>. Bauhinus vpon Matthiolus his
Comentaries on Dioscorides, calleth it <i>Solanum fætidum spinosum</i>. Some
learned men haue referred it to <i>Nux Metel</i>, of the Arabian Authors. Wee
call them generally, in English, Thorne-Apples, and distinguish them by
their titles of greater and letter, single and double.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The East Indian lasciuious women performe strange acts with the seed (of
the smaller kinde, as I suppose, or it may be of either) giuing it their husbands
to drinke. The whole plant, but especially the seed, is of a very cold
and soporiferous quality, procuring sleep and distraction of senses. A few
of the seeds steeped and giuen in drinke, will cause them that take it to seem
starke drunke or dead drunke, which fit will within a few houres weare away,
and they recouer their senses againe, as a drunken man raysed after
sleep from his wine. It may therefore (in my opinion) be of safe and good
vse to one, that is to haue a legge or an arme cut off, or to be cut for the stone,
or some other such like cure to be performed, to take away the sense of paine
for the time of doing it; otherwise I hold it not fit to be vsed without great
caution. But the greene leaues of the greater kindes (as also the lesser, but
that with vs they are not so plentifull) are by tryed experience, found to be
excellent good for any scalded or burned part, as also to take away any hot
inflammations, being made vp into a salue or ointment with suet, waxe, and
rossin, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> or with <i>Axungia</i>, that is, Hogs larde.</p>

  <span class="line sub-title">Indian Henbane, or Tabacco.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere hath beene formerly but three kindes of Tabacco knowne vnto vs, two
of them called Indian, and the third English Tabacco. In these later yeares, we
haue had in our gardens about London (before the suppressing of the planting)
three or foure other sorts at the least, and all of the Indian kinde, hauing some especiall
difference, eyther in leafe, or flower, or both: And in regard the flowers of some
of these carry a pretty shew, I shall only entreate of them, and not of the English kind.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tabacco latifolium.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Broade leafed Tabacco.</span>
</h4>

<p>The great Indian Tabacco hath many very large, long, thicke, fat and faire greene
leaues, standing foreright for the most part, and compassing the stalkes at the bottome
of them, being somewhat pointed at the end: the stalke is greene and round, sixe or
seuen foote high at sometimes, and in some places, in others not past three or foure
foote high, diuided towards the toppe into many branches, with leaues at euery ioynt,
and at the toppes of the branches many flowers, the bottomes hereof are long and
hollow, and the toppes plaited or folded before they are open, but being open, are
diuided sometimes into foure, or more vsually into fiue corners, somewhat like vnto
other of the Bell-flowers, but lying a little flatter open, of a light carnation colour.
The seede is very small and browne, contained in round heads, that are clammy while
they are greene, and pointed at the end: the roote is great, whitish, and woody at the
head, dispersing many long branches, and small fibres vnder the ground, whereby it is
strongly fastened, but perisheth with our violent frosts in the winter, if it be left abroad
in the garden, but if it be housed, or safely prouided for against the frostes, the rootes
will liue, and spring afresh the next yeare.</p>

<p>There is of this kinde another sort, whose leaues are as large and long as the former,
but thicker, and of a more dead greene colour, hanging downe to the ground-ward,
and scarce any standing forth-right, as the former, vnlesse they bee very young: the
flowers of this kinde are almost whole, without any great shew of corners at the brims
or edges, in all other things there is no difference.</p>

<p>There is another, whose large and thicke flat leaues doe compasse the stalke at the
bottome, and are as it were folded together one side vnto another: the flowers are of a
deeper blush, or carnation colour, and with longer points and corners then in any of
the former; and in these two things consisteth the difference from the others, and is
called Verines Tabacco.</p>

<p>Another hath his leaues not so large and long as the first, and these haue short footestalkes,
whereon they stand, and doe not compasse the stalke as the other doe: the
flower hereof is like the first, but smaller, and of a little paler colour.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tabacco angustifolium.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Narrow leafed Tabacco.</span>
</h4>

<p>This kinde of Tabacco hath somewhat lower, and smaller stalkes, then any of the
former: the leaues hereof are smaller and narrower, and not altogether so thicke,
but more pointed, and euery one standing vpon a footstalke, an inch and a halfe long
at the least: the flowers hereof stand thicker together, vpon the small branches, somewhat
larger, of a deeper blush colour, and more eminent corners then in any the former;
the seed and roots are alike, and perish in like manner, vnlesse it be brought into
a cellar, or other such couert, to defend it from the extremitie of the Winter.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>America or the West Indies is the place where all these kindes doe grow
naturally, some in one place, and some in another, as in Peru, Trinidado,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Hispaniola, and almost in euery Iland and Countrey of the continent thereof:
with vs they are cherished in gardens, as well for the medicinable qualities,
as for the beauty of the flowers.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>It flowreth in August, seldome before, and the seede is ripe quickly after.
If it once sowe it selfe in a Garden, it will giue next year after young plants:
but for the most part they will spring vp late, and therefore they that would
haue them more early, haue sowen the seede vpon a bed of dung, and
transplanted them afterwards.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>This plant hath gotten many names. The Indians call it in some places
<i>Petum</i>, in others, <i>Picielt</i>, and <i>Perebecenuc</i>, as Ouiedus and others doe relate.
The Spaniards in the Indies first called it <i>Tabacco</i>, of an Iland where plenty
of it grew. It hath in Christendome receiued diuers other names, as <i>Nicotiana</i>,
of one Nicot a French man, who seeing it in Portugall, sent it to the
French Queene, from whom it receiued the name of <i>Herba Regina</i>. Lobel
calleth it <i>Sancta herba</i>, &amp; <i>Sanasancta Indorum</i>. Some haue adiudged it to be
an <i>Hioscyamus</i>, and therefore call it <i>Peruvianus</i>. The most vsuall name wherby
we call it in English, is Tabacco.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The herbe is, out of question, an excellent helpe and remedy for diuers
diseases, if it were rightly ordered and applyed, but the continuall abuse
thereof in so many, doth almost abolish all good vse in any. Notwithstanding
if men would apply their wits to the finding out of the vertues, I make
no doubt but many strange cures would bee performed by it, both inward
and outward. For outward application, a Salue made hereof (as is before recited
of the Thorne apple leaues) cureth vlcers, and wounds of hard curation:
And for inward helpes, a Syrupe made of the iuice and sugar, or honey,
procureth a gentle vomit (but the dryed leafe infused in wine much
more) and is effectuall in astmaticall diseases, if it bee carefully giuen. And
likewise cleanseth cankers and fistulaes admirably, as hath beene found by
late experience. The ashes of Tabacco is often vsed, and with good successe,
for cuts in the hands, or other places, and for other small greene
wounds.</p>

flowers, as pure white, pure yellow, pure red, white and red spotted, and red
and yellow spotted. But besides these, I haue had some other sorts, among
which was one, of a pale purple or peach colour: all which, comming vnto mee out
of Spaine with many other, seedes in an vnkindly yeare (an early winter following a
cold summer) perished with mee; yet I plainely might discerne by their leaues, and
manner of growing, to be diuers from them that we now haue and keepe. I shall need
therefore (because the chiefest difference consisteth almost in the flowers) to giue only
one description of the plant, and therein shew the varieties as is before declared.</p>

  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Admirabilis.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The Meruaile of the World.</span>
</h4>

<p>The stalke of this meruellous plant is great and thick, bigger then any mans thumbe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
bunched out or swelling at euery ioynt, in some the stalkes will bee of a faire greene
colour, and those will bring white, or white and red flowers: in others they will bee
reddish; and more at the ioynts, and those giue red flowers; and in some of a darker
greene colour, which giue yellow flowers; the stalkes and ioynts of those that will
giue red and yellow flowers spotted, are somewhat brownish, but not so red as those
that giue wholly red flowers: vpon these stalkes that spread into many branches, doe
grow at the ioynts vpon seuerall footestalkes, faire greene leaues, broad at the stalke,
and pointed at the end: at the ioynts likewise toward the vpper part of the branches,
at the foote of the leaues, come forth seuerall flowers vpon short footestalkes, euery
one being small, long and hollow from the bottome to the brimme, which is broade
spread open, and round, and consist but of one leafe without diuision, like vnto a Bell
flower, but not cornered at all: which flowers, as I said, are of diuers colours, and
diuersly marked and spotted, some being wholly white, without any spot in them for
the most part, through all the flowers of the plant; so likewise some being yellow,
and some wholly red; some plants againe being mixed and spotted, so variably either
white and red, or purple, (except here and there some may chance to be wholly white,
or red or purple among the rest) or red and yellow through the whole plant, (except
as before some may chance in this kinde to be eyther wholly red, or wholly yellow)
that you shall hardly finde two or three flowers in a hundred, that will bee alike
spotted and marked, without some diuersitie, and so likewise euery day, as long as they
blow, which is vntill the winters, or rather autumnes cold blastes do stay their willing
pronenesse to flower: And I haue often also obserued, that one side of a plant will
giue fairer varieties then another, which is most commonly the Easterne, as the more
temperate and shadowie side. All these flowers doe open for the most part, in the
euening, or in the night time, and so stand blowne open, vntill the next mornings sun
beginne to grow warme vpon them, which then close themselues together, all the
brims of the flowers shrinking into the middle of the long necke, much like vnto the
blew Bindeweede, which in a manner doth so close vp at the sunnes warme heate: or
else if the day be temperate and milde, without much sunne shining vpon them, the
flowers will not close vp for the most part of that day, or vntill toward night: after
the flowers are past, come seuerall seedes, that is, but one at a place as the flowers stood
before, of the bignesse (sometimes) of pease, but not so round, standing within the
greene huskes, wherein the flowers stood before, being a little flat at the toppe, like a
crowne or head, and round where it is fastened in the cup, of a blacke colour when it
is ripe, but else greene all the while it groweth on the stalke, and being ripe is soone
shaken downe with the wind, or any other light shaking: the roote is long and round,
greater at the head, and smaller downwards to the end, like vnto a Reddish, spreading
into two or three, or more branches, blackish on the outside and whitish within.
These rootes I haue often preserued by art a winter, two or three (for they will perish
if they be left out in the garden, vnlesse it be vnder a house side) because many times,
the yeare not falling out kindely, the plants giue not ripe seede, and so we should be to
seeke both of seede to sow, and of rootes to set, if this or the like art to keep them,
were not vsed; which is in this manner: Within a while after the first frosts haue taken
the plants, that the leaues wither and fall, digge vp the rootes whole, and lay them
in a dry place for three or foure dayes, that the superfluous moysture on the outside,
may be spent and dryed, which done, wrap them vp seuerally in two or three browne
papers, and lay them by in a boxe, chest or tub, in some conuenient place of the house
all the winter time, where no winde or moist ayre may come vnto them; and thus you
shall haue these rootes to spring a fresh the next yeare, if you plant them in the beginning
of March, as I haue sufficiently tryed. But some haue tryed to put them vp into
a barrell or firkin of sand, or ashes, which is also good if the sand and ashes be thorough
dry, but if it bee anything moist, or if they giue againe in the winter, as it is vsuall,
they haue found the moisture of the rootes, or of the sand, or both, to putrefie the
rootes, that they haue beene nothing worth, when they haue taken them forth. Take
this note also for the sowing of your seede, that if you would haue variable flowers,
and not all of one colour, you must choose out such flowers as be variable while they
grow, that you may haue the seede of them: for if the flowers bee of one entire colour,
you shall haue for the most part from those seedes, plants that will bring flowers
all of that colour, whether it be white, red or yellow.</p>

of fiue leaues, with a long forked clapper therein, of the same colour with the flower:
the chiefest difference from the common consisteth in this, that the leaues of these
flowers are longer, and more wide open at the brimmes (almost like a Bell flower)
and of a faire blush or light carnation colour, closing at night, and opening all the

for as soone as it feeleth the Sunnes warme heate, it closeth vp and neuer openeth againe,
so that you shall very seldome see a flower blowne open in the day time, after
nine a clocke in the morning: after these flowers are past, there rise vp in their places
thinne, round, shining or transparent bladders, pointed at the toppe, and ribbed down
all along, wherein are contained small, round, blackish seede: the roote is long and
small, and perisheth euery yeare.</p>

<p>The stalkes of this Mallow are very long, hard or wooddy, more then of any of
the other Mallowes: at the lower part whereof, and vp to the middle, stand diuers
leaues vpon long footestalkes, parted or diuided into fiue parts or leaues, and dented
about the edges; but vpwards from the middle to the toppe, the leaues haue but three
diuisions: among these leaues stand large wide open flowers, of the colour of the
common Mallow: the seede is smaller then in any other Mallow, but the rootes are
great and long, spreading in the ground like vnto the rootes of Marsh Mallowes, and
springeth vp afresh euery yeare from the roote.</p>

  <span class="line">Thorney Mallowe.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Thorney Mallowe hath greene leaues next vnto the ground, that are almost
round, but pointed at the end, and dented very much about the edges; the other leaues
that growe vpon the stalke are diuided into three parts, like vnto a trefoile, and some
of them into fiue diuisions, all of them dented about the edges: the stalke is reddish,
with some harmelesse prickles in sundry places thereon, and riseth vp three or foure
foote high in a good ground, a fit place, and a kindly yeare, bearing plenty of flowers
vpon the stalkes, one at the foote of euery leafe, the toppe it selfe ending in a long
spike, as it were of buddes and leaues together: the flowers are of a very pale yellow,
tending to a white colour, spotted in the bottome of each of the fiue leaues, with a
deepe purple spot, broad at the lower part, and ending in a point about the middle of
the leafe, which are quickly fading, and not abiding aboue one day, with a long pestle
in the middle diuided at the toppe: after the flower is past, commeth vp a short prickly
podde, set within a small greene huske or cup that bore the flower, wherein is contai<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>ned
whitish, or rather brownish yellow seede, flat and somewhat round, like vnto the
seedes of Hollyhocke: the roote is stringie, and quickly perisheth; for it will hardly
endure in our cold Country to giue flowers, much lesse seede, vnlesse (as I said before)
it happen in a kindly yeare, and be well planted and tended.</p>

<p>This Mallow is also as tender to nourse vp as the last, hauing the lower leaues broad
like a Marsh Mallow, and of a fresh greene colour; but those that growe vpon the
stalke, and vp to the toppe, are diuided into fiue parts or points, but are not cut in to
the middle ribbe, like the former Thorney Mallow, yet dented about the edges like
vnto them: the flowers growe at the setting to of the leaues, like vnto a Mallow for
forme, but of a whitish colour; after which come long fiue square pointed pods, with
hard shels, wherein are contained round blackish gray seede, as bigge as a Vetch or
bigger: the roote perisheth quickly with vs, euen with the first frosts.</p>

  <span class="line">Shrubbe Mallow with a white or purple flower.</span>
</h4>

<p>There are diuers sorts of shrubbe Mallowes, whereof some that haue their stemmes
or stalkes lesse wooddy, dye downe to the ground euery yeare, and others that abide
alwayes, are more wooddy: Of the former sorts I intend not to speake, referring them
to a fitter place; and of the other, I will onely giue you the knowledge of one or two
in this place, although I doe acknowledge their fitted place had been to be among the
shrubbes; but because they are Mallowes, I pray let them passe with the rest of their
kindred, and their descriptions in this manner: These wooddy kindes of shrub Mallowes
haue somewhat large, long, and diuided leaues, of a whitish greene colour, soft
also, and as it were woolly in handling, set dispersedly on the whitish hard or wooddy
stalkes: their flowers are large, like vnto a single Rose or Hollyhocke, in the one being
white with purple spots in the bottome; in the other either of a deepe red colour, or
else of a paler purple, with a deeper bottome, and with veines running in euery leafe:
they are somewhat tender, and would not be suffered to be vncouered in the Winter
time, or yet abroad in the Garden, but kept in a large pot or tubbe, in the house or in a
warme cellar, if you would haue them to thriue.</p>

  <span class="line">Hollihockes single and double of seuerall colours.</span>
</h4>

<p>I shall not neede to make many descriptions of Hollihockes, in regard the greatest
difference consisteth in the flowers, which are in some single, in some double, in some
of one colour, and in others of other colours: for the lowest leaues of Hollihockes are
all round, and somewhat large, with many corners, but not cut in or diuided, soft in
handling; but those that growe vp higher are much more diuided into many corners:
the stalkes sometimes growe like a tree, at the least higher then any man, with diuers
such diuided leaues on them, and flowers from the middle to the toppe, where they
stand as it were a long spike of leaues and buds for flowers together: the flowers are of
diuers colours, both single and double, as pure white, and pale blush, almost like
a white, and more blush, fresh and liuely, of a Rose colour, Scarlet, and a deeper red
like a crimson, and of a darke red like blacke bloud; these are the most especiall colours
both of single and double flowers that I haue seene: the single flowers consist of fiue
broad and round leaues, standing round like vnto single Roses, with a middle long
stile, and some chiues aboue them: the double flowers are like vnto double Roses, very
thicke, so that no stile or vmbone is seene in the middle, and the outermost rowe of
leaues in the flowers are largest, the innermost being smaller and thicke set together:
after the flowers are past, there come vp as well in the double as single, flat round
heads, like flat cakes, round about the bottomes whereof growe flat whitish seede: the
roote is long and great at the head, white and tough, like the roote of the common
Mallowes, but greater, and will reasonably well abide the Winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first groweth wilde in Spaine. The second in our owne Countrey.
The third is thought to growe in Italy and Venice; but Lobel denieth it,
saying, that it is there onely in Gardens, and is more plentifull in these
parts then with them. The fourth Clusius saith he found in many places of
Germany. The fifth is supposed to be first brought out of the West Indies,
but an Arabicke name being giuen it, maketh me somewhat doubtfull how
to beleeue it. The sixth groweth in Egypt, where it is of great vse, as Prosper
Alpinus hath let downe in his <cite>Booke of Egyptian plants</cite>. The seuenth
groweth in some parts both of Spaine and France. The last is not found
but in Gardens euery where.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The first, second, third, fourth, and last, doe flower from Iune vntill the
end of Iuly and August. The rest flower very late, many times not vntill
September or October.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first and second haue their names sufficiently expressed in their titles.
The third is diuersly called, as <i>Malua horaria</i>, <i>Alcea versicaria</i>, <i>Alcea Veneta</i>,
<i>Alcea Peregrina</i>, and of Matthiolus, <i>Hypecoum</i>. The most vsuall English name
is Venice Mallow. The fourth is called <i>Alcea fruticosa pentaphyllea</i>, and <i>Cannabinifolio</i>,
or <i>Pentaphyllifolio</i>: In English, Cinquefoile Mallow. The fifth
hath been sent vnder the name of <i>Sabdarifa</i>, and <i>Sabdariffa</i>, and (as I said) is
thought to be brought from America, and therefore it beareth the name of
that Country. The sixth is called in Egypt, <i>Bamia</i>, or <i>Bammia</i>, and by that
name sent with the addition <i>del Cayro</i> vnto it: In English, Egyptian Mallow,
or Mallow of Egypt. The seuenth is called <i>Althæa frutex</i>, and of some
<i>Althæa arborea</i>: In English, Shrubbe Mallow, because his stemme is wooddie,
and abideth as shrubbes and trees doe. The eight and last is called
<i>Malua hortensis</i>, <i>Malua Rosea</i>, and of some <i>Rosa vltra marina</i>: In English, of
some Hockes, and vsually Hollihockes.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>All sorts of Mallowes, by reason of their viscous or slimie quality, doe
helpe to make the body soluble, being vsed inwardly, and thereby helpe
also to ease the paines of the stone and grauell, causing them to be the more
easily voided: being outwardly applyed, they mollifie hard tumours, and
helpe to ease paines in diuers parts of the body; yet those that are of most
vse, are most common. The rest are but taken vpon credit.</p>

  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amaranthus purpureus minor.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The small purple Flower-gentle.</span>
</h4>

<p>This gallant purple Veluet flower, or Flower-gentle, hath a crested stalke two foote
high or more, purplish at the bottome, but greene to the toppe, whereout groweth
many small branches, the leaues on the stalkes and branches are somewhat broad at
the bottome, and sharpe pointed, of a full greene colour, and often somewhat reddish
withall, like in forme vnto the leaues of Blites (whereof this and the rest are accounted
<i>species</i>, or sorts) or small Beetes: the flowers are long, spikie, soft, and gentle tufts of
haires, many as it were growing together, broad at the bottome, and small vp at the
toppe, pyramis or steeple-fashion, of so excellent a shining deepe purple colour, tending
to a murrey, that in the most excellent coloured Veluet, cannot be seene a more
orient colour, (and I thinke from this respect, the French call it <i>Passe velours</i>, that is to
say, passing Veluet in colour) without any smell at all, which being bruised giueth the
same excellent purple colour on paper, and being gathered in his full strength and
beauty, will abide a great time (if it be kept out of the winde and sunne in a dry place)
in the same grace and colour: among these tufts lye the seede scattered, which is small,
very blacke, and shining: the rootes are a few threddy strings, which quickly perish,
as the whole plant doth, at the first approach of Winter weather.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amaranthus Coccineus.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Scarlet Flower-gentle.</span>
</h4>

<p>The leaues of this Flower-gentle are longer, and somewhat narrower then the former;
the stalke groweth somewhat higher, bearing his long tufts at seuerall leaues, as
also at the toppe of the stalkes, many being set together, but separate one from another,
and each bowing or bending downe his head, like vnto a Feather, such as is worn
in our Gallants and Gentlewomens heads, of an excellent bloudy Scarlet colour: the
seede is blacke, like vnto the former: the roote perisheth quicklier, because it is
more tender.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amaranthus tricolor.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Spotted or variable Flower-gentle.</span>
</h4>

<p>The chiefest beauty of this plant consisteth in the leaues, and not in the flowers; for
they are small tufts growing along the stalke, which is nothing so high as the former,
especially with vs, and at the ioynts with the leaues: the leaues hereof are of the
same fashion that the former are, and pointed also; but euery leafe is to be seene parted
into greene, red, and yellow, very orient and fresh (especially if it come to his
full perfection, which is in hot and dry weather) diuided not all alike, but in some
leaues, where the red or yellow is, there will be greene, and so varying, that it is very
pleasant to behold: the seede hereof is blacke and shining, not to bee knowne from
the former.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amaranthus Carnea spica.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Carnation Flower-gentle.</span>
</h4>

<p>There is another more rare then all the rest, whose leaues are somewhat longer, and
narrower then the first, and like vnto the second kinde: the spikes are short, many set
together, like branches full of heads or eares of corne, euery one whereof hath some
long haires sticking out from them, of a deep blush, tending to a carnation colour.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amaranthus purpureus maior paniculis sparsis.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Great Floramour, or purple Flower-gentle.</span>
</h4>

<p>The great Floramour hath one thicke, tall, crested, browne red stalke, fiue or six
foote high, from whence spring many great broad leaues, like vnto the former for the
forme, but much larger &amp; redder for the most part, especially the lowest, which brancheth
forth into diuers parts, &amp; from between these leaues, &amp; the stalks or branches, as
also at the tops of them, stand long, spikie, round, &amp; somewhat flat tufts, of a more reddish
purple colour then the first, and diuided also into seuerall parts, wherin when they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
are full ripe, are to be seen an innumerable company of white seed, standing out among
the short thrums, and do then easily fall away with a little touching; euery one of these
white seed hath as it were an hole halfe bored through therin: the root is a great bush of
strings, spreading in the ground, whereby it is strongly fastened, yet perisheth euery
yeare, after it hath giuen his seede.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>All these plants growe in the Easterne Countries, as Persia, Syria, Arabia,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> except the greatest, which hath been brought out of the West Indies,
where it is much vsed, especially the seede: they are all,
noursed vp with much care in our Gardens, and yet in a backward or cold
yeare they will not thriue, for that they desire much heate: but the greatest
doth alwayes giue ripe seede euery yeare.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They beare their gallant tufts or spikes for the most part in August, and
some not vntill September.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The name <i>Amaranthus</i> is giuen to all these plants, taken from the Greeke
word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμαραντίνος</span>, <i>non marcescens</i>, or <i>non senescens</i>, that is, neuer waxing old,
and is often also imposed on other plants, who haue the same property, that
is, that their flowers being gathered in a fit season, will retaine their natiue
colour a long time, as shall be shewed in the <a href="#Chap_2_XCIII" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 93">Chapter following</a>. Diuers do
thinke the first to be <i>Phlox</i>, or <i>Flamma</i> of Theophrastus. The third is called
<i>Gelosia</i>, or <i>Celosia</i> of Tragus. <cite>Spigelius in his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Isagoges</i></cite> saith, it is generally
taken to be <i>Sophonia</i>, whereof Plinie maketh mention; and Lobel, to bee
the Persians <i>Theombroton</i> of Plinie. The Italians, from whom I had it (by
the meanes of <abbr title="Mister">Mʳ.</abbr> Doctor Iohn More, as I haue had many other rare simples)
call it, <i>Blito di tre colori</i>, A three coloured Blite. The fifth, which is
the greatest, hath been sent from the West Indies by the name of <i>Quinüa</i>,
as Clusius reporteth. The name Flower-gentle in English, and <i>Floramour</i>,
which is the French, of <i>Flos amoris</i>, and <i>Passe velours</i>, as is before said, or
Veluet flower, according to the Italian, <i>Flor veluto</i>, are equally giuen to all
these plants, with their seuerall distinctions, as they are expressed in their
titles.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>Diuers suppose the flowers of these plants doe helpe to stay the fluxe
of bloud in man or woman, because that other things that are red or purple
doe performe the same. But Galen disproueth that opinion very notably,

  <span class="line">The Golden flower of life.</span>
</h4>

<p>This first Golden tuft riseth vp with many hard, round, white stalkes, a foote and a
halfe high, whereon at certaine distances stand many fine cut leaues, or rather one leafe
cut into many small fine parts, almost as small as Fenell, but grayish, like vnto the Cud-weedes
or Cotton-weedes (whereof certainly these are speciall kindes) at the toppes
of the stalkes stand many round flowers, of a pale gold colour, in an vmbell close together,
yet euery flower vpon his owne stalke, and all of an euen height, which will
keepe the colour, being gathered, and kept dry for a long time after, and are of a hot
and quicke sent: the roote is small and wooddy, spreading vnder the vpper crust of
the earth, and liueth long in his owne naturall place, but very hardly endureth the
cold of our Winters, vnlesse they be milde, or it be well defended.</p>

  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helichrysum Creticum.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Candy Goldilockes.</span>
</h4>

<p>Candy Goldilockes hath two or three small slender white branches, set here and
there very scatteringly, with small, long, and narrow hoary leaues, hauing yellow
heads of flowers at the tops made into vmbels or tufts, not so round and euen as the
former, but longwise one aboue another, the heads being made as it were of scales,
loosly, and not so closely set together, as in the next following, which when they are
full ripe, doe passe into doune, and are blowne away with the winde, hauing a small
reddish seede at the end; but will abide a long time, as the other in his beauty, being

<p>This most beautifull plant is very like vnto the former Candy Goldilockes last described,
but growing vp higher, with many more branches, and more hoary, white,
and woolly, hauing also long and narrow white leaues, but somewhat broader, and
thicker set on the branches: the tufts of flowers or vmbels likewise doe consist of
longer and larger heads, more scaly, and closer compact together, of an excellent
pale gold yellow colour, and shining, with some yellow threads or thrummes in the
middle: the roote dyeth not euery yeare, but liueth long, especially in the South and

<p>This Golden flower is somewhat like the former of these two last described, hauing
hoary stalkes and leaues, standing confusedly on them, being long, and narrower then
any of the former: the tops of the stalkes are diuided into many parts, each bearing a
small long yellow head or flower at the toppe, with some yellow thrummes in them,
which heads being many, are diffusedly set together, like a loose or sparsed vmbell,
keeping their colour long before they wither, and when they are ripe, haue thinne

rising into hard, thicke round stalkes, containe still the same hoarinesse vpon them, as
also vpon the long and narrow leaues which are set thereon, especially on the vnder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>

the toppe into many small branches, each whereof haue many scaly tufted heads set
together, couered ouer with cotton before their opening, and then diffeuering one
from another, abiding very white on the outside, when they are fully growne, but
with a small yellow thrume in the midde of euery flower, which in time turne into

<p>This small Cudweede or Cottonweede, hath many small white woolly leaues
growing from the roote, which is composed of a few small blackish threds, and lying
vpon the ground somewhat like vnto the leaues of a small Mouse eare, but smaller;
from among which riseth vp a small stalke of halfe a foote high or thereabouts, beset
here and there with some few leaues, at the top whereof commeth forth a tuft of small
flowers, set close together, in some of a pure white, in others of a purple or reddish
colour, in some of a pale red or blush, and in others of a white and purple mixt together,
which for the beauty is much commended and desired, but will hardly abide to

<p>This little rose Cotton weede hath many such like woolly leaues, growing as the
former from the roote vpon small short branches, not full an hand breadth high, in fashion
somewhat like vnto Daysie leaues, but lesser, and round pointed: at the toppe of
euery stalke or branch, standeth one flower, composed of two rowes of small white
leaues, layd open like a Starre or a Rose, as it beareth the name, hauing a round head
in the middle made of many yellow threds or thrumes, which falling away, there riseth
vp a small round head, full of small seedes: the root is small, long and threddy.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The foure first plants doe grow naturally in many of the hot Countries
of Europe, as Spaine, Italie, and Prouince in France; as also in Candy,
Barbary, and other places, and must be carefully kept with vs in the winter
time. The Liue long was brought out of the West Indies, and groweth
plentifully in our gardens. The two last doe grow as well in the colder
Countries of Germany, as in France and other places.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They all flower in the end of September, if they will shew out their beauty
at all with vs, for sometimes it is so late, that they haue no faire colour at all,
especially the foure first sorts.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>Variable and many are the names that seuerall Writers do call these foure
first sorts of plants, as <i>Helichrysum</i>, <i>Heliochrysum</i>, or <i>Elichrysum</i>, <i>Eliochrysum</i>,
<i>Chrysocome</i>, <i>Coma aurea</i>, <i>Amaranthus luteus</i>, <i>Stoechas Citrina</i>, and <i>Aurelia</i>, with
others, needlesse here to be recited: it is sufficient for this worke, to giue
you knowledge that their names are sufficient as they are expressed in their
titles: The fift is called <i>Gnaphalium</i> by Carolus Clusius, from the likenesse
of the vmbels or tufts of heads, though greater and white: for as I said before,
the Cotton weedes are of kindred with the golden tufts: It hath been
called by our English Gentlewomen, Liue long, and Life euerlasting, because
of the durabilitie of the flowers in their beautie. The two last are cal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>led
<i>Gnaphalium</i>, according to their titles; and in English they may passe vnder
those names are set downe with them.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The foure first are accounted to bee hot and dry, and the three last to bee
cold and dry: yet all of them may to some good purpose bee applyed to
rheumaticke heads. The former foure are likewise vsed to cause vrine, and
in baths to comfort and heate cold parts. They are also layd in chests and
wardrobes, to keepe garments from moths; and are worne in the heads and
armes of Gentiles and others, for their beautifull aspect.</p>

not abide the extremities of our winters, eyther abroade or vnder couert, vnlesse it

<p>This beautifull plant riseth vp with faire greene, large, broade leaues, euery one rising
out of the middle of the other, and are folded together, or writhed like vnto a
paper Coffin (as they call it) such as Comfitmakers and Grocers vse, to put in their
Comfits and Spices, and being spread open, another riseth from the bottome thereof,
folded in the same manner, which are set at the ioynts of the stalke when it is risen vp,
like vnto our water Reede, and growing (if it runne vp for flower) to be three or foure
foote high, as I haue obserued in mine owne garden: the flowers grow at the toppe of
the stalke one aboue another, which before their opening are long, small, round, and
pointed at the end, very like vnto the claw of a Crauise or Sea-Crab, and of the same
red or crimson colour, but being open, are very like vnto the flower of <i>Gladiolus</i> or
Corne-flagge, but of a more orient colour then at the first, and standing in a rough
huske, wherein afterwards standeth a three square head, containing therein round
blacke seede, of the bignesse of a pease: the roote is white and tuberous, growing into
many knobs, from whence arise such other leaues and stalkes, whereby it encreaseth
very much, if it be rightly kept and defended.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

  <span class="line sub-title"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mandragoras.</i></span>
  <span class="line sub-title">Mandrake.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e Mandrake is distinguished into two kindes, the male and the female; the
male hath two sorts, the one differing from the other, as shall be shewed; but of
the female I know but one: The male is frequent in many gardens, but the female,
in that it is more tender and rare, is noursed vp but in a few.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mandragoras mas.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The male Mandrake.</span>
</h4>

<p>The male Mandrake thrusteth vp many leaues together out of the ground, which
being full growne, are faire, large and greene lying round about the roote, and are larger
and longer then the greatest leaues of any Lettice, whereunto it is likened by Dioscorides
and others: from the middle, among these leaues, rise vp many flowers, euery
one vpon a long slender stalke, standing in a whitish greene huske, consisting of fiue
pretty large round pointed leaues, of a greenish white colour, which turne into small
round apples, greene at the first, and of a pale red colour when they are ripe, very
smooth and shining on the outside, and of a heady or strong stuffing smell, wherein is
contained round whitish flat seede: the roote is long and thicke, blackish on the outside,
and white within, consisting many times but of one long roote, and sometimes
diuided into two branches a little below the head, and sometimes into three or more,
as nature listeth to bestow vpon it, as my selfe haue often seene, by the transplanting of
many, as also by breaking and cutting off of many parts of the rootes, but neuer found
harme by so doing, as many idle tales haue beene set downe in writing, and deliuered
also by report, of much danger to happen to such, as should digge them vp or breake
them; neyther haue I euer seene any forme of man like or woman-like parts, in the
rootes of any: but as I said, it hath oftentimes two maine rootes running down right
into the ground, and sometimes three, and sometimes but one, as it likewise often happeneth
to Parsneps, Carrots, or the like. But many cunning counterfeit rootes haue bin
shaped to such formes, and publickly exposed to the view of all that would see them,
and haue been tolerated by the chiefe Magistrates of the Citie, notwithstanding that
they haue beene informed that such practices were meere deceit, and vnsufferable;
whether this happened through their ouer-credulitie of the thing, or of the persons,
or through an opinion that the information of the truth rose vpon enuy, I know not,
I leaue that to the searcher of all hearts: But this you may bee bold to rest vpon, and
assure your selues, that such formes as haue bin publickly exposed to be seene, were neuer
so formed by nature, but only by the art and cunning of knaues and deceiuers, and
let this be your <i>Galeatum</i> against all such vaine, idle and ridiculous toyes of mens inuentions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>
<p>There is likewise another sort of these male Mandrakes, which I first saw at Canterbury;
with my very louing and kinde friende Iohn Tradescante, in the garden of the
Lord Wotton, whose gardiner he was at that time; the leaues whereof were of a
more grayish greene colour, and somewhat folded together, when as the former kind
that grew hard by it, was of the same forme that is before described, and ordinary in
all others: but whether the apples were differing from the other, I know not, nor did
they remember that euer it had borne any.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mandragoras fæmina.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The female Mandrake.</span>
</h4>

<p>The female Mandrake doth likewise put vp many leaues together, from the head of
the roote, but they are nothing so large, and are of a darker greene colour, narrower
also and shining, more crumpled, and of a stronger sent: the flowers are many, rising
vp in the middle of the leaues, vpon slender stalkes, as in the male kind, but of a blewish
purple colour, which turne into small round fruite or apples, and not long like a
peare (as Clusius reporteth that saw them naturally growing in Spaine) greene at the
first, and of a pale yellowish colour, when they are full ripe; of a more pleasing, or if
you will, of a lesse heady sent then the apples of the male, wherein is contained such
like seede, but smaller and blacker: the rootes are like the former, blacke without and
white within, and diuided in the same manner as the male is, sometimes with more,
and sometimes with fewer parts or branches.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>They grow in many places of Italie, as Matthiolus reporteth, but especially
on Mount Garganus in Apulia. Clusius saith hee found the female in
many wet grounds of Spaine, as also in the borders of those medowes that
lye neere vnto riuers and water courses. The male is cherished in many
Gardens, for pleasure as well as for vse; but the female as is said, is both very
rare, and farre more tender.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The Male flowreth in March, and the fruit is ripe in Iuly. The Female, if
it be well preserued, flowreth not vntill August, or September; so that without
extraordinary care, we neuer see the fruite thereof in our gardens.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p><i>Mandragoras mas</i> is called <i>albus</i>, as the <i>Fæmina</i> is called <i>niger</i>, which titles
of blacke and white, are referred vnto the colour of the leaues: the female
is called also <i>Thridacias</i>, from the likenesse of Lettice, whereunto they
say in forme it doth carry some similitude. Dioscorides saith, that in his time
the male was called <i>Morion</i>, and both of them <i>Antimelum</i>, and <i>Circæa</i>. Wee
call them in English, The male, and the female Mandrake.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The leaues haue a cooling and drying qualitie, fit for the oyntment <i>Populeon</i>,
wherein it is put. But the Apples haue a soporiferous propertie, as
Leuinus Lemnius maketh mention in his <cite>Herball to the Bible</cite>, of an experiment
of his owne. Besides, as Dioscorides first, and then Serapio, Auicen,
Paulus Ægineta, and others also do declare, they conduce much to the cooling
and cleansing of an hot <i>matrix</i>. And it is probable, that Rachel knowing
that they might be profitable for her hot and dry body, was the more
earnest with Leah for her Sonne Rubens Apples, as it is set downe <i><cite>Genesis
30. verse 14</cite></i>. The strong sent of these apples is remembred also, <i><cite><abbr title="Canticles">Cant.</abbr> 7. 13.</cite></i>
although some would diuert the signification of the Hebrew word, <span lang="hbo" xml:lang="hbo">דודאים</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
vnto Violets, or some other sweet flowers, in <cite>the former place of <i>Genesis</i></cite>,
and the fruit of <i>Musa</i>, or Adams Apples in <cite>this place of the <i>Canticles</i></cite>.
Hamilcar the Carthaginian Captaine is said to haue infected the wine of
the Lybians (his enemies against whom he fought) with the apples of Mandrake,
whereby they being made exceeding drowsie, he obtained a famous
victory ouer them.</p>

<p>This greater kinde of Loue Apples, which hath beene most frequently cherished
with vs, hath diuers long and trayling branches, leaning or spreading vpon the ground,
not able to sustaine themselues, whereon doe grow many long winged leaues, that is,
many leaues set on both sides, and all along a middle ribbe, some being greater, and
others lesse, iagged also and dented about the edges, of a grayish ouer-worne greene
colour, somewhat rough or hairy in handling; from among the leaues and the branches
come forth long stalkes, with diuers flowers set thereon, vpon seuerall short footstalks,
consisting of sixe, and sometimes of eight small long yellow leaues, with a middle
pricke or vmbone, which after the flowers are fallen, riseth to be the fruite, which are
of the bignesse of a small or meane Pippin, vneuenly bunched out in diuers places,
and scarce any full round without bunches, of a faire pale reddish colour, or somewhat
deeper, like vnto an Orenge, full of a slimie iuice and watery pulpe, wherein the seede
lyeth, which is white, flat and somewhat rough: the roote shooteth with many small
strings and bigger branches vnder ground, but perisheth at the first feeling of our winter
weather. The fruite hereof by often sowing it in our Land, is become much smaller
then I haue here described it: but was at the first, and so for two or three yeares after,

but much smaller: the fruite are small, round, yellowish red berries, not much
bigger then great grapes, wherein are contained white flat seede, like the other, but
smaller: the roote perisheth in like manner euery yeare, and therefore must bee new

<p>They growe naturally in the hot Countries of Barbary, and Ethiopia;

<p>They flower in Iuly and August, and their fruit is ripe in the middle or

<p>The first is named diuersly by diuers Authors; for Lobel, Camerarius,

and Bauhinus after him, make it to be a kinde of <i>Solanum Pomiferum</i>. Anguillara
taketh it to be <i>Lycopersicum</i> of Galen. Others thinke it to bee <i>Glaucium</i>
of Dioscorides. The last is called <i>Mala Æthiopica parua</i>, and by that
title was first sent vnto vs, as if the former were of the same kinde and
country. We call them in English, Apples of Loue, Loue-Apples, Golden
Apples, or Amorous Apples, and all as much to one purpose as another,
more then for their beautifull aspect.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>In the hot Countries where they naturally growe, they are much eaten
of the people, to coole and quench the heate and thirst of their hot stomaches.

white, fashioned like vnto the former, but not so great or large, in all other things
alike: the rootes hereof did abide sometime in our Gardens, but since perished, and
the seede also, since when we neuer could obtaine from any our friends of that kinde

</h4>

<p>The leaues of this greater yellow Foxegloue, are in forme somewhat like vnto the
common purple kinde, but not altogether so large: the stalke groweth to bee three or
foure foote high, whereon stand many long hollow pendulous flowers, in shape like
the ordinary purple: but somewhat shorter, and more large and open at the brimmes,
of a faire yellow colour, wherein are long threads, like as in the others: the roote
hereof is greater at the head, and more wooddy then any of the rest, with many

<p>This small pale yellow Foxegloue hath somewhat short, broad, smooth and darke
greene leaues, snipt or dented about the edges very finely: the stalke is two foot high,
beset with such like leaues, but lesser: the flowers are more in number then in any of the
rest, except the first and greatest, and growe along the vpper part of the stalke, being
long and hollow, like the other, but very small, and of a pale yellow colour almost
white: the seede vessels are small like the former, wherein are contained seede like

<p>Onely the name <i>Digitalis</i>, is of all Writers giuen vnto these plants; for
it is not knowne to bee remembred of any of the old Authors. Wee call
them generally in English, Foxegloue; but some (as thinking it to bee too
foolish a name) doe call them Finger-flowers, because they are like vnto the
fingers of a gloue, the ends cut off.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>Foxegloues are not vsed in Physicke by any iudicious man that I know;
yet some Italians of Bononia, as Camerarius saith, in his time vsed it as a
wound herbe.</p>

Mullein, base Mullein, Moth Mullein, and Ethiopian Mullein, all which to
distinguish or to describe, is neither my purpose, nor the intent of this worke,
which is to store a Garden with flowers of delight, and sequester others not worthy
of that honour. Those that are fit to bee brought to your consideration in this place,
are first, the <i>Blattarias</i>, or Moth Mulleins, and then the wooddy Mullein, which otherwise
is called French Sage, and lastly, the Ethiopian Mullein, whose beauty consisteth
not in the flower, but in the whole plant; yet if it please you not, take it according
to his Country for a Moore, an Infidell, a Slaue, and so vse it.</p>

  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Blattaria lutea odorata.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Sweete yellow Moth Mullein.</span>
</h4>

<p>The yellow Moth Mullein whose flower is sweete, hath many hard grayish greene
leaues lying on the ground, somewhat long and broad, and pointed at the end: the
stalks are two or three foot high, with some leaues on them, &amp; branching out from the
middle vpwards into many long branches, stored with many small pale yellow flowers,
of a pretty sweete sent, somewhat stronger then in the other sorts, which seldome
giueth seede, but abideth in the roote, during many yeares, which few or none of the
others doe.</p>

  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Blattaria lutea maior siue Hispanica.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The great yellow Moth Mullein.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Spanish kinde hath larger and greener leaues then the former, and rounder
and larger then the next that followeth: the stalke is higher than in any of the Moth
Mulleins, being for the most part foure or fiue foote high, whereon toward the toppe
growe many goodly yellow flowers, consisting of fiue leaues, as all the rest doe, not
so thicke set as the former, but much larger, with some small purplish threads in the
middle: the ends whereof are fashioned somewhat like as if a Flie were creeping vp
the flower, which turne into round heads, sometimes two or three or more standing
together, but vsually one, wherein lye small duskie seed: the roote is not great nor full
of threads, and doth perish most vsually hauing giuen seede, except the Winter bee
very milde.</p>

<p>This yellow Moth Mullein (which is the most frequent in our Gardens) hath
longer, and narrower leaues then any of the former, and roundly notched or dented
on the edges, of a darke greene colour: the stalke is sometimes branched, but most
vsually single, whereon stand many gold yellow flowers, not fully so large as the Spanish
kinde, but with the like purple threads in the middle: the seede is small, and
contained in the like round heads, but alwaies euery one single by it selfe: the roote
perisheth euery yeare that it beareth seede.</p>

  <span class="line">Cloth of gold Moth Mullein.</span>
</h4>

<p>The greatest point of difference betweene this and the last described, consisteth
chiefly in the colour of the flower, which in this is of the colour of cloth of gold, that
is, the ground yellow, and ouershadowed with a bright crimson colour, which is a fine
colour of much delight: the threads in the middle are not so purple red as in the former,
but much about the colour of the flower: this is not so willing to giue seede, and
will as hardly abide in the roote, and hath out of question risen from the seede of the
former.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Blattaria flore albo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">White Moth Mullein.</span>
</h4>

<p>The leaues of the white Moth Mullein are somewhat like vnto the yellow, yet not
altogether so much roundly notched about the edges, but rather a little dented, with
sharper notches: the stalke riseth as high as the yellow, and hath now and then some
branches about it: the flowers hereof are pure white, as large and great as the ordinary
yellow, or somewhat larger, with the like purple threads in the middle, as are in the
yellow: the seed is like the other; the root perisheth in like manner, and will not endure.</p>

  <span class="line">6. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Blattaria flore purpureo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Purple Moth Mullein.</span>
</h4>

<p>The Purple Moth Mullein hath his leaues lying on the ground, broader and shorter
then any of the other, of a more grayish greene colour, and without any denting
for the most part about the edges, sharpe pointed also at the end of the leafe; among
the leaues riseth vp the stalke, not so high as either the white or the yellow, and many
times branched, bearing many flowers thereon, of the same fashion, and no whit
smaller, of a faire deepe blewish colour tending to rednesse, the threads in the middle
of the flowers being yellow: the seede vessels hereof are somewhat smaller then any
of the former, except the first sweete yellow kinde: the roote hereof is long, thicke,
and blackish on the outside, abiding very well from yeare to yeare, and riseth well
also from the sowing of the seede.</p>

<p>This blew Moth Mullein is in all respects like vnto the former purple kinde, sauing
onely in the colour of the flower, which is of a blewish violet colour, and is not much
inferiour either in greatnesse of the plant, or in the largenesse of the flower, vnto the
former purple kinde, and endureth many yeares in the like manner. And these be all

<p>Wooddy Mullein or French Sage, hath diuers wooddy branches two or three foot
high, very hoary or white, whereon at seuerall ioynts stand diuers thicke leaues, white
also and hoary, long, somewhat broad, round pointed, and rough, somewhat resembling
the leaues of Sage in the forme and roughnesse, but not in the sent, whereof our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
people gaue it the name of Sage, calling it French Sage (when as it is as great a stranger
in France as in England, yet they doe with this as with many other things, calling
them French, which come from beyond the Seas; as for example, all or most of
our bulbous flowers, they call French flowers, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>) at the toppes of the stalkes and
branches, at certaine distances, are placed round about them many gaping flowers,
like vnto the flowers of Sage, but yellow: after which now and then come seede,
somewhat bigger then the Moth Mulleins, and lesse then the next Mullein of Ethiopia:
the roote is wooddy at the toppe, with diuers blackish strings growing from it, and endureth
as well aboue ground with his leaues, as vnder it with his rootes.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">9. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æthiopis.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Ethiopian Mullein.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Mullein of Ethiopia hath many great, broad, and large leaues lying on the
ground, rent or torne in diuers of them very much on the sides, of so hoary a white
greene colour, that it farre passeth any of the white Mulleins, that growe wilde abroad
in our owne Country; for they are of a yellowish white hoarinesse, nothing so pleasant
to looke on as this: in the middle of these leaues riseth vp a square strong stalke,
foure or fiue foote high, set full of such like leaues as growe belowe, but much lesser,
and lesser still vp to the toppe, all hoary and woolly, as the rest, and diuided into manie
branches, spreading farre, and taking vp a great compasse of ground, more then
any one roote of Garden Clary, or other such like plant: at each of the stalkes and
branches are set two small leaues, and with them, round about the stalkes, stand many
small gaping flowers, of a pale bleake blew colour: the seede is almost as large as Garden
Clary seede, and of the same forme and colour: the roote is wooddy, and perisheth
as soone as it hath borne seede, which is vsually the second yeare after the sowing;
for the first yeare it seldome runneth vp to flower.</p>

<p>Let mee thrust this plant into this place, rather then make a peculiar Chapter, because
I haue no other of the same stocke or kindred to be ioyned with it, and is a pretty
ornament in a Garden. The leaues whereof are very large, round, and great, rough
or full of veines, which make it seeme crumpled, dented or deepely notched about the
edges, and of a very darke greene colour, and some times brownish, or of a darke
reddish colour withall, euery one standing on a long foote-stalke, very like in forme
vnto the great white Arch-Angell leaues, but farre larger and blacker: the stalkes are
great and foure square, hauing leaues and flowers standing round about them at the
ioynts like coronets, which flowers are very great, long, and wide gaping open, of a
darke red or purple colour, with some whitenesse or spots in the iawes, and some hairinesse
also on the sides, which stand in full flower two or three moneths most vsually,
and sometimes longer, after which come brownish seede: the roote is a great tuft or
bush of long whitish strings, and encreaseth euery yeare, not fearing the greatest
iniuries of our coldest and extreamest Winters.</p>

  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Valeriana rubra Dodonæi.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Red Valerian.</span>

<p>This Valerian hath diuers hard, but brittle whitish greene stalkes, rising from the
roote, full of tuberous or swelling ioynts, whereat stand two leaues, on each side one,
and now and then some small leaues from betweene them, which are somewhat long
and narrow, broadest in the middle, and small at both ends, without either diuision
or incisure on the edges, of a pale greene colour: the stalkes are branched at the top
into diuers parts, at the ends whereof stand many flowers together, as it were in an
vmbell or tuft, somewhat like vnto the flowers of our ordinary Valerian, but with
longer neckes, and of a fine red colour, very pleasant to behold, but of no sent of any
Valerian: after these flowers haue stood blowne a very great while, they sodainely
fall away, and the seede is ripe very quickly after, which is whitish, standing vpon
the branches naked, as the Valerians doe, and very like vnto them, with a little white
doune at the end of euery one of them, whereby they are soone carried away with
the winde: the roote is great, thicke, and white, continuing long, and shooting out
new branches euery yeare, and smelling somewhat like a Valerian.</p>

  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nardus Montana tuberosa.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Knobbed Mountaine Valerian.</span>

<p>This kinde of Valerian or Spiknard, if you will so call it, hath his first leaues lying
on the ground, without any diuision in them at all, being smooth, and of a darke greene
colour, which so abide all the winter; but those that spring vp after, and when it runneth
vp to flower, are cut in on the edges, very like vnto the iagged leaues of the great
garden Valerian, and so the elder they grow, the more cut and iagged they are: the
stalke and flowers are very like the stalke with flowers of the garden Valerian, but of a
darke or deepe red colour, and more store of them thrust together, by double the
number almost: the seede is like the seede of the great Valerian: the root is tuberous,
or knobbed in many parts, round about, aboue and below also, with some fibres shooting

  <span class="line">Greeke Valerian.</span>
</h4>

<p>The Greek Valerian hath many winged leaues lying vpon the ground, that is, many
small leaues set on both sides of a middle ribbe, very like vnto the wilde Valerian, that
groweth by the ditch sides, but much smaller and tenderer, among which rise vp one
or two round brittle stalkes, two foote high or thereabouts, whereon are set at the
ioynts, such like leaues as grow below, but smaller: the toppes of the stalkes are diuided
into many small branches, thicke set together, full with flowers, consisting of
fiue small round leaues a peece, layd open like vnto the Cinquefoile flower, with some
white threds in the middle, tipt with yellow pendents: the colour of these flowers in
some plants, is of a faire bleake blew colour, and in others pure white: And I doe
heare of one beyond the Seas (if the report bee true, for I haue not seene such a one)
which should beare red flowers: after the flowers are past, there come vp in their places
small hard huskes or heads, containing small blackish seedes: the roote is composed
of a number of small long blackish threds, fastened together at the head, without
any sent at all of a Valerian, eyther in roote or leafe; and why it should bee called
a Valerian I see no great reason, for it agreeth with none of them, in flower or seede,
and but onely with the wilde Valerian in leafe, as I said before: but as it is, we so giue
it you, and for the flowers sake is receiued into our gardens, to helpe to fill vp the number
of natures rarities and varieties.</p>

</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is generally called of most, <i>Valeriana rubra Dodonæi</i>, who saith
also that some would haue it to be <i>Behen rubrum</i>. Some call it <i>Valerianthon</i>,
others make it a kinde of <i>Ocimastrum</i>, and some <i>Saponaria altera</i>, with other
names, which are to no great purpose to set downe in this place, it beeing
fitter for a generall worke to discusse of names, wherein both reading, knowledge

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The last most vsually flowreth before the former, yet not much differing,
that is, in the end of Aprill or in May.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is a double kinde of that plant, that growing wilde abroade, is
vsually called <i>Cardamine altera</i>, and <i>Sisymbrium alterum</i> of Dioscorides, and
of some <i>Flos cuculi</i>, but not fitly; for that name is more vsually giuen vnto
the wilde featherd Campion, both single and double, as is before expressed:
yet for want of a fitter name, wee may call it in English, eyther Cuckowe
flower, or Ladyes smockes which you will. The second hath beene sent vnder
the name of <i>Sanicula trifolia</i>, but the most frequent name now receiued,
is <i>Cardamine trifolia</i>, and in English Trefoile Ladies smockes.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The double Ladies smockes are of the same qualitie with the single, and
is thought to be as effectuall as Watercresses. The propertie of the other I
thinke is not much knowne, although some would make it a wound herbe.</p>

  <span class="line">Candy Tufts white and purple.</span>
</h4>

<p>This small plant riseth seldome aboue a foote and a halfe high, hauing small, narrow,
long and whitish greene leaues, notched or dented with three or foure notches on each
side, from the middle to the point-wards; from among which rise vp the stalkes,
branched from the bottome almost into diuers small branches, at the toppes whereof
stand many small flowers, thick thrust together in an vmbell or tuft, making them seeme
to be small, round, double flowers of many leaues, when as euery flower is single, and
standeth a part by it selfe, of a faire white colour in some plants, without any spot, and
in others with a purplish spot in the centre or middle, as if some of the middle leaues
were purple; in others agane the whole flower is purplish all ouer, which make a pretty
shew in a garden: the seede is contained in many small and flat seed vessels, which stand
together in an vmbell, as the flowers did, in which are contained somewhat reddish
seede, like vnto some other sorts of <i>Thlaspi</i>, called Treakle Mustards: the roote is small
and hard, and perisheth euery yeare hauing giuen seede.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thlaspi Marinum

<p>We haue another sort, whose leaues before it sendeth forth any stalke, are a little
toothed, or finely dented about the edges, and brancheth not so much out, but carryeth
an vmbell of purplish flowers like vnto the former, and paler yellow seede.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is named by some, <i>Draba</i>, or <i>Arabis</i>, as Dodonæus, but <i>Draba</i>
is another plant differing much from this. Wee call one sort, <i>Thlaspi Creticum</i>,
and the other <i>Thlaspi Bæticum marinum</i>, because the one came from
Spaine, and the other from Candy; we giue it in English, the name of
Tufts, because it doth fit the forme of the flowers best, although ordinarily
all the <i>Thlaspi</i> are Englished Wilde Mustardes.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>Candy, or Spanish Tufts, is not so sharpe biting in taste, as some other
of the Thlaspies are, and therefore is not to be vsed in medicines, where
<i>Thlaspi</i> should be in the stead thereof.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">H<span class="looks_big">a</span>uing shewed you all my store of herbes bearing fine flowers, let mee now
bring to your consideration the rest of those plants, be they Shrubs or Trees,
that are cherished in our garden, for the beauty of their flowers chiefly, or for
some other beautifull respect: and first I will begin with such as creepe on the ground,
without climing, and then such as clime vp by poles, or other things, that are set or
grow neere them, fit to make Bowers, and Arbours, or else are like them in forme, in
name, or some other such qualitie or propertie.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clematis Daphnoides, siue Vinca peruinca simplex minor diuersorum colorum.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Single Perwinkle of diuers colours.</span>
</h4>

<p>The smaller Perwinkle which not onely groweth wilde in many places, but is most
vsuall in our Gardens, hath diuers creeping branches, trayling or running vpon the
ground, shooting out small fibres at the ioynts, as it creepeth, taking thereby hold in
the ground, and rooteth in diuers places: at the ioynts of these branches stand two
small darke greene shining leaues, somewhat like vnto small Baye leaues, but smaller,
and at the ioynts likewise with the leaues, come forth the flowers, one at a ioynt, standing
vpon a tender footestalke, being somewhat long and hollow, parted at the brims,
sometimes into foure leaues, and sometimes into fiue, the most ordinary sort is of a
pale or bleake blew colour, but some are pure white, and some of a darke reddish purple
colour: the root is in the body of it, little bigger then a rush, bushing in the ground,
and creeping with his branches farre about, taking roote in many places, whereby it
quickely possesseth a great compasse; and is therefore most vsually planted vnder
hedges, or where it may haue roome to runne.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vinca peruinca flore duplici purpureo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Double purple Perwinkle.</span>
</h4>

<p>The double Perwinkle is like vnto the former single kinde, in all things except in
the flower, which is of that darke reddish purple colour that is in one of the single
kindes; but this hath another row of leaues within the flower, so that the two rowes
of leaues causeth it to be called double, but the leaues of these are lesser then the single.
I haue heard of one with a double white flower, but I haue not yet seene it.</p>

  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clematis Daphnoides siue Peruinca maior.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The greater Perwinkle.</span>
</h4>

<p>This greater Perwinkle is somewhat like the former, but greater, yet his branches
creepe not in that manner, but stand more vpright, or lesse creeping at the least: the
leaues also hereof stand by couples at the ioynts, but they are broader and larger by
the halfe: the flowers are larger, consisting of fiue leaues that are blew, a little deeper
then the former blew: this plant is farre tenderer to keepe then the other, and therefore
would stand warme, as well as in a moist shadowie place.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clematis altera siue vrens flore albo.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Burning Clamberer, or Virgins Bower.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Causticke or burning Climer, hath very long and climing tender branches,
yet somewhat woody below, which winde about those things that stand neere it, couered
with a brownish greene barke, from the ioynts whereof shoote forth many
winged leaues, consisting for the most part of fiue single leaues, that is two and two
together, and one at the end, which are a little cut in or notched on the edges here and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
there, but euery part of them is lesser then the leaues of the next following Climer,
without any clasping tendrels to winde about any thing at all: towards the vpper part
of the branches, with the said leaues, come forth long stalks, whereon stand many white
flowers clustering together, opening the brims into sixe or eight small leaues, spreading
like a starre, very sweet of smell, or rather of a strong heady sent, which after
turne into flattish and blackish seede, plumed at the head, which plume or feather flyeth
away with the winde after it hath stood long, and leaueth the seede naked or bare:
the roote is white and thicke, fleshie and tender, or easie to be broken, as my selfe can
well testifie, in that desiring to take a sucker from the roote, I could not handle
it so tenderly, but that it broke notwithstanding all my care. Master Gerard in his
<cite>Herball</cite> maketh mention of one of this kinde with double white flowers, which hee
saith he recouered from the seede was sent him from Argentine, that is Strasborough,
whereof hee setteth forth the figure with double flowers: but I neuer saw any such
with him, neither did I euer heare of any of this kinde with double flowers. Clusius
indeed saith, that hee receiued from a friend some seede vnder the name of <i>Clematis
flore albo pleno</i>: but he doubteth whether there bee any such: the plants that sprang
with him from that seede, were like vnto the vpright kinde called <i>Flammila Matthioli</i>,
or <i>Iouis cresta</i>, as he there saith: but assuredly I haue beene informed from some of my
especiall friends beyond Sea, that they haue a double white <i>Clematis</i>, and haue promised
to send it; but whether it will be of the climing or vpright sort, I cannot tell vntill
I see it: but surely I doe much doubt whether the double will giue any good seede.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clematis altera siue peregrina flore rubro.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Red Ladies Bower.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Climer hath many limber and weake climing branches like the former, couered
with a browne thin outer barke, and greene vnderneath: the leaues stand at the
ioynts, consisting but of three leaues or parts, whereof some are notched on one side,
and some on both, without any clasping tendrels also, but winding with his branches
about any thing standeth next vnto it: the flowers in like manner come from the same
ioynts with the leaues, but not so many together as the former vpon long footstalkes,
consisting of foure leaues a peece, standing like a crosse, of a darke red colour; the
seed is flat and round, and pointed at the end, three or foure or more standing close together
vpon one stalk, without any doune vpon them at all, as in the former: the roots
are a bundell of brownish yellow strong strings, running down deep into the ground,
from a bigge head aboue.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">6. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clematis peregrina flore purpureo simplici.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Single purple Ladies Bower.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Ladies Bower differeth in nothing from the last described, but onely in the
colour of the flower, which is of a sad blewish purple colour; so that the one is not
possible to be known from the other, vntill they be in flower.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">7. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clematis peregrina flore purpurea pleno.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Double flowred purple Ladies Bower.</span>
</h4>

<p>This double <i>Clematis</i> hath branches and leaues so neere resembling the single kinds,
that there can be knowne no difference, vnlesse it be, that this groweth more goale and
great, and yeeldeth both more store of branches from the ground, and more spreading
aboue: the chiefest marke to distinguish it is the flower, which in this is very thicke
and double, consisting of a number of smaller leaues, set close together in order in the
middle, the foure outermost leaues that encompasse them, being much broader and
larger then any of the inward, but all of a dull or sad blewish purple colour, the points
or ends of the leaues seeming a little darker then the middle of them: this beareth
no seede that euer I could see, heare of, or learne by any of credit, that haue noursed
it a great while; and therefore the tales of false deceitfull gardiners, and others, that
diliuer such for truth, to deceiue persons ignorant thereof, must not bee credulously
entertained.</p>

<p>In <cite>the great booke of the Garden of the Bishop of Eystot</cite> (which place is neere
vnto Noromberg) in Germany, I reade of a <i>Clematis</i> of this former kinde, whose figure
is thereto also annexed, with double flowers of an incarnate, or pale purple tending
to a blush colour, whereof I haue not heard from any other place.</p>

  <span class="line">Vpright Virgins Bower.</span>
</h4>

<p>This kinde of <i>Clematis</i> hath diuers more vpright stalkes then any of the foure last
described, sometimes foure or fiue foote high, or more: yet leaning or bending a little,
so that it had some neede of sustaining, couered with a brownish barke; from
whence come forth on all sides diuers winged leaues, consisting of fiue or seuen leaues,
set on both sides of a middle ribbe, whereof one is at the end: the tops of the stalkes
are diuided into many branches, bearing many white sweet smelling flowers on them,
like in fashion vnto the white Virgins Bower; after which come such like feather topt
seede, which remaine and shew themselues, being flat like the other, when the plumes
are blowne abroad: the roote spreadeth in the ground from a thicke head, into many
long strings, and fasteneth it selfe strongly in the earth; but all the stalkes dye downe
euery yeare, and spring afresh in the beginning of the next.</p>

  <span class="line">9. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clematis cærulea Pannonica.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The Hungarian Climer.</span>
</h4>

<p>The stalks of this plant stand vpright, &amp; are foure square, bearing at euery ioynt two
leaues, which at the first are closed together, and after they are open, are somewhat like
vnto the leaues of <i>Asclepias</i>, or Swallow-wort: from the tops of the stalks, and sometimes
also from the sides by the leaues commeth forth one flower, bending the head
downward, consisting of foure leaues, somewhat long &amp; narrow, standing like a crosse,
and turning vp their ends a little againe, of a faire blew or skie colour, with a thicke
pale yellow short thrumme, made like a head in the middle: after the flower is past,
the head turneth into such a like round feather topt ball, as is to be seene in the Trauellers
ioy, or <i>Viorna</i> (as it is called) that groweth plentifully in Kent, and in other
places by the way sides, and in the hedges, wherein is included such like flat seede.
These stalkes (like as the last) dye downe to the ground euery yeare, and rise againe
in the Spring following, shooting out new branches, and therby encreaseth in the root.</p>

  <span class="line">The Virginia Climer.</span>
</h4>

<p>Because this braue and too much desired plant doth in some things resemble the
former Climers, so that vnto what other family or kindred I might better conioyne it
I know not; let me I pray insert it in the end of their Chapter, with this description. It
riseth out of the ground (very late in the yeare, about the beginning of May, if it be a
plant hath risen from the seed of our owne sowing, and if it be an old one, such as hath
been brought to vs from Virginia, not till the end thereof) with a round stalke, not aboue
a yard and a halfe high (in any that I haue seene) but in hotter Countries, as some
Authors haue set it downe, much higher, bearing one leafe at euery ioynt, which
from the ground to the middle thereof hath no claspers, but from thence vpwards
hath at the same ioynt with the leafe both a small twining clasper, like vnto a Vine, and
a flower also: euery leafe is broad at the stalke thereof, and diuided about the middle
on both sides, making it somewhat resemble a Figge leafe, ending in three points,
whereof the middlemost is longest: the bud of the flower, before it doe open, is very
like vnto the head or seede vessell of the ordinary single <i>Nigella</i>, hauing at the head or
top fiue small crooked hornes, which when this bud openeth, are the ends or points of
fiue leaues, that are white on the inside, and lay themselues flat, like vnto an Anemone,
and are a little hollow like a scoope at the end, with fiue other smaller leaues, and
whiter then they lying betweene them, which were hid in the bud before it opened,
so that this flower being full blowne open, consisteth of ten white leaues, laide in order
round one by another: from the bottome of these leaues on the inside, rise diuers
twined threads, which spread and lay themselues all ouer these white leaues, reaching
beyond the points of them a little, and are of a reddish peach colour: towards the bot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>tomes
likewise of these white leaues there are two red circles, about the breadth of
an Oten strawe, one distant from another (and in some flowers there is but one circle
seen) which adde a great grace vnto the flower; for the white leaues shew their colour
through the peach coloured threads, and these red circles or rings vpon them being
also perspicuous, make a tripartite shew
of colours most delightfull: the middle
part of this flower is hollow, and yellowish;
in the bottome whereof riseth vp an
vmbone, or round stile, somewhat bigge,
of a whitish greene colour, spotted with
reddish spots like the stalkes of Dragons,
with fiue round threads or chiues, spotted
in the like manner, and tipt at the
ends with yellow pendents, standing about
the middle part of the said vmbone,
and from thence rising higher, endeth
in three long crooked hornes most
vsually (but sometimes in foure, as hath
beene obserued in Rome by <cite id="aldine"><abbr title="Doctor">Dʳ.</abbr> Aldine,
that set forth some principall things of
Cardinall Farnesius his Garden</cite>) spotted
like the rest, hauing three round greene
buttons at their ends: these flowers are
of a comfortable sweete sent, very acceptable,
which perish without yeelding
fruit with vs, because it flowreth so late:
but in the naturall place, and in hot
Countries, it beareth a small round whitish
fruit, with a crowne at the toppe
thereof, wherein is contained (while it is
fresh, and before it be ouer dried) a sweet
liquor, but when it is dry, the seede within it, which is small, flat, somewhat rough
and blacke, will make a ratling noise: the rootes are composed of a number of exceeding
long and round yellowish browne strings, spreading farre abroad vnder the
ground (I haue seene some rootes that haue beene brought ouer, that were as long as
any rootes of <i>Sarsaparilla</i>, and a great deale bigger, which to be handsomely laid into
the ground, were faine to be coyled like a cable) and shooting vp in seuerall places a
good distance one from another, whereby it may be well encreased.</p>

<p>The first is out of question the first <i>Clematis</i> of Dioscorides, and called of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
many <i>Clematis Daphnoides</i> (but not that plant that is simply called <i>Daphnoides</i>,
for that is <i>Laureola</i>) and is vsually called <i>Vinca pervinca</i>: but it is not
<i>Chamædaphne</i>, for that is another plant, as shall be shewed in his place; some
call it <i>Centunculus</i>: In English wee call it Perwinkle. The other is <i>Clematis
altera</i> of Dioscorides, and is called also <i>Clematis peregrina</i>, whose distinctions
are set downe in their titles: In English, Ladies Bower, or Virgins
Bower, because they are fit to growe by Arbours, to couer them. The first
vpright Clamberer is called, and that rightly of some, <i>Clematis erecta</i>, or
<i>surrecta</i>. Of others, <i>Flammula frutex</i>, and <i>Flammula Iouis</i>, or <i>surrecta</i>: In
English, Vpright Virgins Bower. The next is called by Clusius, <i>Clematis
Pannonica cæulea</i>, who thought it to be <i>Climeni species</i>, by the relation of others,
at the first, but after entituled it, <i>Clematis</i>: In English, the Hungarian
Climer. The last may be called in Latine, <i>Clematis Virginiana</i>: In English,
The Virgin or Virginian Climer; of the Virginians, <i>Maracoc</i>: of the Spaniards
in the West Indies <i>Granadillo</i>, because the fruit (as is before said) is in
some fashion like a small Pomegranate on the outside; yet the seede within
is flattish, round, and blackish. Some superstitious Iesuite would faine make
men beleeue, that in the flower of this plant are to be seene all the markes of
our Sauiours Passion; and therefore call it <i>Flos Passionis</i>: and to that end
haue caused figures to be drawne, and printed, with all the parts proportioned
out, as thornes, nailes, speare, whippe, pillar, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> in it, and all as true
as the Sea burnes, which you may well perceiue by the true figure, taken to
the life of the plant, compared with the figures set forth by the Iesuites,
which I haue placed here likewise for euery one to see: but these bee their
aduantagious lies (which with them are tolerable, or rather pious and meritorious)
wherewith they vse to instruct their people; but I dare say, God
neuer willed his Priests to instruct his people with lyes: for they come from
the Diuell, the author of them. But you may say I am beside my Text, and
I am in doubt you will thinke, I am in this besides my selfe, and so nothing
to be beleeued herein that I say. For, for the most part, it is an inherent errour
in all of that side, to beleeue nothing, be it neuer so true, that any of
our side shall affirme, that contrarieth the assertions of any of their Fathers,
as they call them: but I must referre them to God, and hee knoweth the

I could not but speake (the occasion being thus offered) against such an erroneous
opinion (which euen <abbr title="Doctor">Dʳ.</abbr> Aldine at Rome, <a href="#aldine" title="go to citation">before remembred</a>, disproued,
and contraried both the said figures and name) and seek to disproue
it, as doth (I say not almost, but I am affraid altogether) leade many to adore
the very picture of such things, as are but the fictions of superstitious brains:
for the flower it selfe is farre differing from their figure, as both Aldine in
the <a href="#aldine" title="go to citation">aforesaid booke</a>, and <cite>Robinus at Paris in his <i>Theatrum Floræ</i></cite>, doe set
forth; the flowers and leaues being drawne to the life, and there exhibited,
which I hope may satisfie all men, that will not be perpetually obstinate and
contentious.</p>

stay the menstruall fluxes. The other are causticke plants, that is, fiery hot,

<p>I haue three sorts of <i>Chamælæa</i> to bring to your consideration, euery one differing
notably from other; two of them of great beauty in their flowers, as well as in the
whole plant: the third abiding with greene leaues, although it haue no beauty in
the flower, yet worthy of the place it holds. And vnto these I must adioyne another
plant, as comming nearest vnto them in the brauery of the flowers.</p>

</h4>

<p>We haue two sorts of this Spurge Oliue or Dwarfe Baye, differing onely in the colour
of the flowers. They both rise vp with a thicke wooddy stemme, fiue or six foot
high sometimes, or more, and of the thicknesse (if they be very old) of a mans wrest at
the ground, spreading into many flexible long branches, couered with a tough grayish
barke, beset with small long leaues, somewhat like vnto Priuet leaues, but smaller and
paler, and in a manner round pointed: the flowers are small, consisting of foure leaues,
many growing together sometimes, and breaking out of the branches by themselues:
in the one sort of a pale red at the first blowing, and more white afterwards; the other
of a deeper red in the blossome, and continuing of a deeper red colour all the time of
the flowring, both of them very sweete in smell: after the flowers are past, come the
berries, which are greene at the first, and very red afterwards, turning blackish red, if
they stand too long vpon the branches: the rootes spread into many tough long branches,
couered with a yellowish barke.</p>

<p>This Mountaine Laurell riseth vp with a small wooddy stemme, three or foure foot

branches, couered with a rough hoary greene barke, beset at the ends thereof with
flatter, fuller, and smaller round pointed leaues then the former, of a grayish greene
colour on the vpperside, and hoary vnderneath, which abide on the branches in
Winter, and fall not away as the former: the flowers are many set together at the ends
of the branches, greater then the former, and consisting of foure leaues a peece, of a
light blush colour, standing in small grayish huskes, of little or no sent at all: the fruit
followeth, which are small long graines or berries, of an excellent red colour, which
afterwards turne blacke: the roote is long, and spreadeth about vnder the vpper part

diuers narrow, long, darke greene leaues all along the branches, which abide greene
all the Winter: the flowers are very small, scarce to be seene, and come forth between
the leaues and the stalke, of a pale yellow colour, made of three leaues; after which
come small blackish berries, three vsually set together; the roote spreadeth it selfe in

<p>I was long in doubt in what place I should dispose of this plant, whether among the
Campions, as Bauhinus, or among these, as Clusius doth; but lest my Garden should
want it wholly, let it take vp roome for this time here. This gallant plant hath diuers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
long, weake, slender, but yet tough branches lying vpon the ground, diuided vsually
into other smaller branches, whereon growe many, small, long, and somewhat thicke
leaues, somewhat like vnto the leaues of the former <i>Mezereon</i>, set without any order
to the very tops, from whence doe come forth a tuft of many small flowers together,
made or consisting of foure leaues a peece, of a bright red or carnation colour, and very
sweete withall, which turne into small round whitish berries, wherein is contained
small round seede, couered with a grayish coate or skinne: the roote is long and yellowish,
spreading diuers wayes vnder the ground, and abideth many yeares shooting
forth new branches.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flore albo.</i></div>

<p>It hath beene obserued in some of these plants, to bring forth white flowers, not
differing in any thing else.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first sorts growe plentifully in many places of Germany. The second
in the mountaines by Sauoye. The third in Prouence and Spaine.
The last in diuers parts of Germany, Bohemia, and Austria, and about
Franckford.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The two first sorts are most vsually in flower about Christmas, or in Ianuary,
if the weather be not violent, and sometimes not vntill February.
The second flowreth not vntill Aprill. The third in May. The berries of
them ripen some in Iune and Iuly; some in August and September, as
their flowring is earlier or later. The last flowreth as well in the Spring as
in Autumne, so apt and plentifull it is in bearing, and the seede at both
times doth ripen soone after.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is called of some <i>Chamælæa</i>, with this addition <i>Germanica</i>, that
it may differ from the third, which is the true <i>Chamælæa</i> of Dioscorides,
as all the best Authors doe agree, and is also called <i>Piper montanum</i> of the
Italians. It is generally called <i>Mezereon</i>, and is indeede the true <i>Mezereon</i>
of the Arabians, and so vsed in our Apothecaries shops, wheresoeuer the
Arabians <i>Mezereon</i> is appointed, although the Arabians are so intricate and
vncertaine in the descriptions of their plants, confounding <i>Chamælæa</i> and
<i>Thymælæa</i> together. Matthiolus maketh it to be <i>Daphnoides</i> of Dioscorides;
but in my opinion he is therein mistaken: for all our best moderne Writers
doe account our <i>Laureola</i>, which hath blacke berries, to bee the true
<i>Daphnoides</i>: the errour of his Countrey might peraduenture drawe him
thereunto; but if hee had better considered the text of Dioscorides, that
giueth black berries to <i>Daphnoides</i>, and red to <i>Chamædaphne</i>, he would not so
haue written; and truly, I should thinke (as Lobel doth) with better reason,
that this <i>Chamælæa</i> were Dioscorides <i>Chamædaphne</i>, then hee to say it were
<i>Daphnoides</i>: for the description of <i>Chamædaphne</i>, may in all parts be very fitly
applyed to this <i>Chamælæa</i>: and euen these words, <i>Semen annexum folijs</i>,
wherein may be the greatest doubt in the description, may not vnfitly bee
construed, that as is seene in the plant, the berries growe at the foote of the
leaues, about the branches: the faculties indeede that Dioscorides giueth
to <i>Chamædaphne</i>, are (if any repugnancie be) the greatest let or hinderance,
that this <i>Chamælæa</i> should not be it: but I leaue the discussing of these and
others of the like nature, to our learned Physitians; for I deale not so much
with vertues as with descriptions. The second is called of Lobel <i>Chamælæa
Alpine incana</i>, of Clusius <i>Chamælæa secunda</i>, and saith hee had it out of Italy.
Wee may call it in English, Mountaine Spurge Oliue, as it is in the description,
or Mountaine Laurell, which you will. The last hath the name of
<i>Cneorum</i>, first giuen it by Matthiolus, which since is continued by all others.
Bauhinus (as I said) referreth it to the Mountaine Campions, but Clusius
(as I doe) to the kindes of <i>Chamælæa</i> or <i>Thymælæa</i>. For want of an English
name I haue (as you see, and that is according to the name the Germane women,
as Clusius saith, doe call it) entituled it the Small Rocke Rose; which
may abide vntill a fitter may be conferred vpon it.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">M<span class="looks_big">y</span> meaning is not to make any description of our ordinary Bayes in this place
(for as all may very well know, they may be for an Orchard or Courtyard, and
not for this Garden) but of two or three other kindes, whose beautifull aspect
haue caused them to be worthy of a place therein: the one is called <i>Laurus Tinus</i>, The
wilde Baye: the other <i>Laurus Rosea</i> or <i>Oleander</i>, The Rose Bay: and a third is
<i>Laurocerasus</i>, The Cherry Bay; which may haue not onely some respect for his long
bush of sweet smelling flowers, but especially for the comely statelinesse of his gallant
euer fresh greene leaues; and the rather, because with vs in most places, it doth
but <i>frutescere</i>, vse to bee Shrub high, not <i>arborescere</i>, Tree high, which is the more fit
for this Garden.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laurus Tinus siue siluestris.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The wilde Bay tree.</span>
</h4>

<p>This wilde Baye groweth seldome to bee a tree of any height, but abideth for the
most part low, shooting forth diuers slender branches, whereon at euery ioynt
stand two leaues, long, smooth, and of a darke greene colour, somewhat like vnto the
leaues of the Female Cornell tree, or between that and Baye leaues: at the toppes of
the branches stand many small white sweete smelling flowers, thrusting together, as it
were in an vmbell or tuft, consisting of fiue leaues a peece, the edges whereof haue a
shew of a wash purple, or light blush in them, which for the most part fall away without
bearing any perfect ripe fruit in our Countrey: Yet sometimes it hath small black
berries, as if they were good, but are not. In his naturall place it beareth small, round,
hard and pointed berries, of a shining blacke colour, for such haue come often to my
hands (yet Clusius writeth they are blew); but I could neuer see any spring that I put
into the ground. This that I here describe, seemeth to me to be neither of both those
that Clusius saw growing in Spain and Portugall, but that other, that (as he saith) sprang
in the low Countreyes of Italian seede.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laurus Rosea siue Oleander.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The Rose Bay.</span>
</h4>

<p>Of the Rose Bay there are two sorts, one bearing crimson coloured flowers, which
is more frequent, and the other white, which is more rare. They are so like in all other
things, that they neede but one description for both. The stemme or trunke is many
times with vs, as bigge at the bottome as a good mans thumbe, but growing vp smaller,
it diuideth it selfe into branches, three for the most part comming from one ioynt or
place, and those branches againe doe likewise diuide themselues into three other, and
so by degrees from three to three, as long as it groweth: the lowest of these are bare
of leaues, hauing shed or lost them by the cold of winters, keeping onely leaues on
the vppermost branches, which are long, and somewhat narrow, like in forme vnto
Peach leaues, but thicker, harder, and of a darke greene colour on the vpperside, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
yellowish greene vnderneath: at the tops of the young branches come forth the flowers,
which in the one sort before they are open, are of an excellent bright crimson colour,
and being blowen, consist of foure long and narrow leaues, round pointed,
somewhat twining themselues, of a paler red colour, almost tending to blush, and in
the other are white, the greene leaues also being of a little fresher colour: after the
flowers are past, in the hot countries, but neuer in ours, there come vp long bending or
crooked flat pods, whose outward shell is hard, almost woody, and of a browne colour,
wherein is contained small flat brownish seede, wrapped in a great deale of a
brownish yellow doune, as fine almost as silke, somewhat like vnto the huskes of <i>Asclepias</i>,
or <i>Periploca</i>, but larger, flatter and harder; as my selfe can testifie, who had
some of the pods of this Rose bay, brought mee out of Spaine, by Master Doctor
Iohn More, the seedes whereof I sowed, and had diuers plants that I raised vp vnto
a reasonable height, but they require, as well old as young, to bee defended from the
colde of our winters.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laurocerasus.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The Bay Cherry.</span>
</h4>

<p>This beautifull bay in his naturall place of growing, groweth to bee a tree of a reasonable
bignesse and height, and oftentimes with vs also if it bee pruined from the
lower branches; but more vsually in these colder Countries, it groweth as a shrub or
hedge bush, shooting forth many branches, whereof the greater and lower are couered
with a darke grayish greene barke, but the young ones are very greene, whereon are
set many goodly, faire, large, thicke and long leaues, a little dented about the edges,
of a more excellent fresh shining greene colour, and farre larger then any Bay leafe,
and compared by many to the leaues of the <i>Pomeritron</i> tree (which because wee haue
none in our Countrey, cannot be so well known) both for colour and largenesse, which
yeeld a most gracefull aspect: it beareth long stalkes of whitish flowers, at the ioynts
of the leaues both along the branches and towards the ends of them also, like vnto
the Birds Cherry or <i>Padus Theophrasti</i>, which the French men call <i>Putier &amp; Cerisier
blanc</i>, but larger and greater, consisting of fiue leaues with many threds in the middle:
after which commeth the fruite or berries, as large or great as Flanders Cherries, many
growing together one by another on a long stalke, as the flowers did, which are
very blacke and shining on the outside, with a little point at the end, and reasonable
sweete in taste, wherein is contained a hard round stone, very like vnto a Cherry stone,
as I haue obserued as well by those I receiued out of Italie, as by them I had of Master
Iames Cole a Merchant of London lately deceased, which grew at his house in Highgate,
where there is a faire tree which hee defended from the bitternesse of the weather
in winter by casting a blanket ouer the toppe thereof euery yeare, thereby the
better to preserue it.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first is not certainly knowne from whence it came, and is communicated
by the suckers it yeeldeth. The second groweth in Spaine, Italie,
Grece, and many other places: that with white flowers is recorded by Bellonius,
to grow in Candy. The last, as Matthiolus, and after him Clusius
report, came first from Constantinople: I had a plant hereof by the friendly
gift of Master Iames Cole, the Merchant before remembred, a great louer
of all rarities, who had it growing with him at his countrey house in
Highgate aforesaid, where it hath flowred diuers times, and borne ripe fruit
also.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The first flowreth many times in the end of the yeare before Christmas,
and often also in Ianuary, but the most kindly time is in March and Aprill,
when the flowers are sweetest. The second flowreth not vntill Iuly. The
last in May, and the fruit is ripe in August and September.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is called <i>Laurus siluestris</i>, and <i>Laurus Tinus</i>: in English Wilde
Bay, or Sweete flowring Bay. The second is called <i>Laurus Rosea</i>, <i>Oleander</i>,
<i>Nerium</i>, and <i>Rhododendros</i>: in English The Rose Bay, and Oleander. The
last was sent by the name of <i>Trebezon Curmasi</i>, that is to say, <i>Dactylus Trapezuntina</i>,
but not hauing any affinitie with any kinde of Bay. Bellonius as I
thinke first named it <i>Laurocerasus</i>, and <i>Cerasus Trapezuntina</i>. Dalechampius
thinketh it to bee <i>Lotus Aphricana</i>, but Clusius refuteth it. Those stones or
kernels that were sent me out of Italie, came by the name of <i>Laurus Regia</i>,
The Kings Bay. Wee may most properly call it according to the Latine
name in the title, The Cherry bay, or Bay Cherry, because his leaues are
like vnto Bay-leaues, and both flowers and fruit like vnto the Birdes Cherry
or Cluster Cherry, for the manner of the growing; and therefore I might
more fitly I confesse haue placed it in my Orchard among the sorts of
Cherries: but the beautifulnesse of the plant caused mee rather to insert it
here.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The wilde Bay hath no propertie allotted vnto it in Physicke, but that it
is not to be endured, the berries being chewed declare it to be so violent hot
and choking. The Rose Bay is said by Dioscorides, to be death to all foure
footed beasts, but contrariwise to man it is a remedie against the poison of
Serpents, but especially if Rue bee added vnto it. The Cherry Bay is not
knowne with vs to what physicke vse it may be applyed.</p>

<p>The double blossomed Cherry tree is of two sorts for the flower, but not differing
in any other part, from the ordinary English or Flanders Cherry tree, growing in
very like manner: the difference consisteth in this, that the one of these two sorts
hath white flowers lesse double, that is, of two rowes or more of leaues, and the other
more double, or with more rowes of leaues, and besides I haue obserued in this greater
double blossomd Cherry, that some yeares most of the flowers haue had another
smaller and double flower, rising vp out of the middle of the other, like as is to bee
seene in the double English Crow-foote, and double redde <i>Ranunculus</i> or Crowfoote,
before described: this I say doth not happen euery yeare, but sometimes. Sometimes
also these trees will giue a few berries, here and there scattered, and that with lesse
double flowers more often, which are like vnto our English Cherries both for taste and
bignesse. These be very fit to be set by Arbours.</p>

my Garden, one that is called double, whose branches spreade far, and being very fit

  <span class="line">The double Honisuckle.</span>
</h4>

<p>The truncke or body of the double Honisuckle, is oftentimes of the bignesse of a
good staffe, running out into many long spreading branches, couered with a whitish
barke, which had neede of some thing to sustaine them, or else they will fall down
to the ground (and therefore it is vsually planted at an arbour, that it may run thereon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
or against a house wall, and fastened thereto in diuers places with nailes) from whence
spring forth at seuerall distances, and at the ioynts, two leaues, being like in forme vnto
the wilde Honisuckles, and round pointed for the most part; these branches diuiding
themselues diuers wayes, haue at the toppes of them many flowers, set at certaine
distances one aboue another, with two greene leaues at euery place, where the flowers
doe stand, ioyned so close at the bottome, and so round and hollow in the middle, that
it seemeth like a hollow cuppe or sawcer of flowers: the flowers stand round about
the middle of these cuppes or sawcers, being long, hollow, and of a whitish yellow
colour, with open mouthes dasht ouer with a light shew of purple, and some threds
within them, very sweet in smell, like both in forme and colour vnto the common Honisuckles,
but that these cuppes with the flowers in them are two or three standing one
aboue another (which make a far better shew then the common, which come forth all
at the heade of the branches, without any greene leaues or cuppes vnder them) and
therefore these were called double Honisuckles.</p>

<p>This vpright Woodbinde hath a straight woody stemme, diuided into seuerall
branches, about three or foure foote high, couered with a very thinne whitish barke,
whereon stand two leaues together at the ioynts, being lesser then the former, smooth
and plaine, and a little pointed: the flowers come forth vpon slender long footstalks
at the ioynts where the leaues stand, alwayes two set together, and neuer more, but
seldome one alone, which are much smaller then the former, but of the same fashion,
with a little button at the foote of the flower; the buds of the flowers before they
are open are very reddish, but being open are not so red, but tending to a kinde of yellowish
blush colour: after which come in their places two small red berries, the one
withered for the most part, or at least smaller then the other, but (as Clusius saith) in
their naturall places they are both full and of one bignesse.</p>

<p>This other vpright Woodbinde groweth vp as high as the former, or rather somewhat
higher, couered with a blackish rugged barke, chapping in diuers places, the
younger branches whereof are somewhat reddish, and couered with an hoary doune:
the leaues stand two together at the ioints, somewhat larger then the former, and more
whitish vnderneath: the flowers are likewise two standing together, at the end of a
slender footestalke, of a pale yellowish colour when they are blowne, but more reddish
in the bud: the berries stand two together as the former, of a darke blewish
colour when they are fully ripe, and full of a red liquour or iuice, of a pleasant taste,
which doth not only dye the hands of them that gather them, but serueth for a dying
colour to the inhabitants where they grow plentifully, wherein are contained many
flat seede: The roote is woody as the former is.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first groweth in Italie, Spaine, and Prouence of France, but not in
the colder countreyes, vnlesse it be there planted, as is most frequent in our
countrey. The others grow in Austria, and Stiria, as Clusius saith, and are
entertained into their gardens onely that are curious.</p>
</div>

<p>The first flowreth vsually in Aprill, the rest in May.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

as a difference from the common kinde: In English Double Woodbinde,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
or double Honisuckles. The others, as they are rare, and little knowne, so
are their names also: yet according to their Latine, I haue giuen them
English names.</p>

yellow Iasmine, but differeth much from their tribe in many notable points: but because
the flowers haue some likenesse with the flowers of the true Iasmine, it hath been
vsually called a Iasmine; and therefore I am content for this Garden to conioyne

<p>The white Iasmine hath many twiggy flexible greene branches, comming forth of
the sundry bigger boughes or stems, that rise from the roote, which are couered with
a grayish darke coloured barke, hauing a white pith within it like the Elder, but not so
much: the winged leaues stand alwaies two together at the ioynts, being made of manie
small and pointed leaues, set on each side of a middle ribbe, six most vsually on
both sides, with one at the end, which is larger, more pointed then any of the rest,
and of a darke greene colour: at the toppes of the young branches stand diuers flowers
together, as it were in an vmbell or tuft, each whereof standeth on a long greene
stalke, comming out of a small huske, being small, long, and hollow belowe, opening
into fiue white small, pointed leaues, of a very strong sweete smell, which fall
away without bearing any fruit at all, that euer I could learne in our Country; but in
the hot Countries where it is naturall, it is said to beare flat fruit, like Lupines: the
rootes spread farre and deepe, and are long and hard to growe, vntill they haue taken
strong hold in the ground.</p>

whereon are set at certaine distances, three small darke greene leaues together,
the end leafe being alwaies the biggest: at the ioynts where the leaues come forth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
stand long stalkes, bearing long hollow flowers, ending in fiue, and some in six leaues,
very like vnto the flowers of the first Iasmine, but yellow, whereupon it is vsually called
the Yellow Iasmine: after the flowers are past, there come in their places round
blacke shining berries, of the bignesse of a great Pease, or bigger, full of a purplish
iuyce, which will dye ones fingers that bruise them but a little: the roote is tough, and
white, creeping farre about vnder the ground, shooting forth plentifully, whereby it
greatly encreaseth.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first is verily thought to haue been first brought to Spaine out of Syria,
or thereabouts, and from Spaine to vs, and is to be seene very often,
and in many of our Country Gardens. The second hath his breeding in
Spaine also, but whether it be his originall place we know not, and is scarce

about Mompelier, and will well abide in our London Gardens, and
any where else.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is generally called <i>Iasminum album</i>, and <i>Gelseminum album</i>: In
English, The white Iasmine. The second hath his name in his title, as much
as may be said of it. The third hath been taken of some to be a <i>Cytisus</i>, others
iudge it to be <i>Polemonium</i>, but the truest name is <i>Trifolium fruticans</i>,
although many call it <i>Iasminum luteum</i>: In English most vsually, The yellow
Iasmine, for the reasons aforesaid; or else after the Latine name,
Shrubbie Trefoile, or Make-bate.</p>

barke, but darker in the elder branches, with ioynts set at a good distance one from

ends, many of them turning or folding both the sides inward, and standing on
long foote stalkes: at the toppes of the branches come forth many flowers, growing
spike-fashion, that is, a long branch of flowers vpon a stalke, each of these flowers are
small, long, and hollow belowe, ending aboue in a pale blewish flower, consisting of
foure small leaues, of a pretty small sent: after the flowers are past, there come sometimes
(but it is not often in our Country, vnlesse the tree haue stood long, and is grown
great, the suckers being continually taken away, that it may growe the better) long and

<p>The first, second, and third flower in Aprill, the other two not vntill May.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is called of Matthiolus <i>Lilac</i>, and by that name is most vsually
called in all parts. It is also called <i>Syringa cærulea</i>, because it commeth nearest
vnto those woods, which for their pithy substance, were made hollow
into pipes. It is called of all in English, The blew Pipe tree. It seemeth
likely, that <cite>Petrus Bellonius in his third Booke and fiftieth Chapter of his
obseruations</cite> (making mention of a shrubbe that the Turkes haue, with Iuie
leaues alwaies greene, bearing blew or violet coloured flowers on a long
stalke, of the bignesse and fashion of a Foxe taile, and thereupon called in
their language a Foxe taile) doth vnderstand this plant here expressed. The
certainty whereof might easily be knowne, if any of our Merchants there
residing, would but call for such a shrubbe, by the name of a Foxe taile in
the Turkish tongue, and take care to send a young roote, in a small tubbe or
basket with earth by Sea, vnto vs here at London, which would be performed
with a very little paines and cost. The second and third, as kindes
thereof, haue their names in their titles. The fourth is called by Clusius
and others, <i>Frutex Coronarius</i>; some doe call it <i>Lilac flore albo</i>, but that name
is not proper, in that it doth confound both kindes together. Lobel calleth
it <i>Syringa Italica</i>. It is now generally called of all <i>Syringa alba</i>, that is in
English, The white Pipe tree. Some would haue it to bee <i>Ostrys</i> of Theophrastus,
but Clusius hath sufficiently cleared that doubt. Of others <i>Ligustrum
Orientale</i>, which it cannot be neither; for the <i>Cyprus</i> of Plinie is Dioscorides
his <i>Ligustrum</i>, which may be called <i>Orientale</i>, in that it is most proper
to the Easterne Countries, and is very sweete, whose seede is like vnto
Coriander seede. The last is called by diuers <i>Syringa Arabica flore albo duplici</i>,
as most fitly agreeing thereunto. Of <cite>Basilius Beslerus that set forth the
great booke of the Bishop of Eystot in Germany his Garden</cite>, <i>Syringa Italica
flore albo pleno</i>, because, as it is likely, hee had it from Italy. It is very
likely, that <cite>Prosper Alpinus in his booke of Egyptian plants</cite>, doth meane
this plant, which hee there calleth <i>Sambach, siue Iasminum Arabicum</i>. Matthæus
Caccini of Florence in his letter to Clusius entituleth it <i>Syringa Arabica,
siue Iasminum Arabicum, siue Iasminum ex Gine</i>, whereby hee declareth
that it may not vnfitly be referred to either of them both. We may call it in
English as it is in the title, The double white Pipe tree.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>We haue no vse of these in Physicke that I know, although Prosper Alpinus

with a pithy substance in the middle, as the Elders haue, to shew that it is a kind thereof,

of white leaued flowers set together vpon the stalke that vpholdeth them, of a
small sent, which fall away without bearing any fruit in our Country, that euer I could

both which being set together, make a pleasant variety, to decke vp the
windowes of a house.</p>

<p>It is generally called <i>Sambucus Rosea</i>: In English, The Elder Rose, and
more commonly after the Dutch name, the Gelder Rose. Dalechampius
seemeth to make it <i>Thraupalus</i> of Theophrastus, or rather the single Marsh
Elder; for I thinke this double kinde was not knowne in Theophrastus his

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e great varietie of Roses is much to be admired, beeing more then is to bee
seene in any other shrubby plant that I know, both for colour, forme and smell.
I haue to furnish this garden thirty sorts at the least, euery one notably differing
from the other, and all fit to be here entertained: for there are some other, that
being wilde and of no beautie or smell, we forbeare, and leaue to their wilde habitations.
To distinguish them by their colours, as white, red, incarnate, and yellow, were
a way that many might take, but I hold it not so conuenient for diuers respects: for so
I should confound those of diuers sorts one among another, and I should not keepe
that methode which to me seemeth most conuenient, which is, to place and ranke euery
kinde, whether single or double, one next vnto the other, that so you may the better
vnderstand their varieties and differences: I will therefore beginne with the most
ancient, and knowne Roses to our Countrey, whether naturall or no I know not, but
assumed by our precedent Kings of all others, to bee cognisances of their dignitie,
the white Rose and the red, whom shall follow the damaske, of the finest sent, and most
vse of all the other sorts, and the rest in their order.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosa Anglica alba.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The English white Rose.</span>
</h4>

<p>The white Rose is of two kindes, the one more thicke and double then the other:
The one riseth vp in some shadowie places, vnto eight or ten foote high, with a stocke
of a great bignesse for a Rose. The other growing seldome higher then a Damaske
Rose. Some doe iudge both these to be but one kinde, the diuersitie happening by the
ayre, or ground, or both. Both these Roses haue somewhat smaller and whiter greene
leaues then in many other Roses, fiue most vsually set on a stalke, and more white vnderneath,
as also a whiter greene barke, armed with sharpe thornes or prickles, whereby
they are soone known from other Roses, although the one not so easily from the other:
the flowers in the one are whitish, with an eye or shew of a blush, especially towards
the ground or bottome of the flower, very thicke double, and close set together, and for
the most part not opening it selfe so largely and fully as eyther the Red or Damaske
Rose. The other more white, lesse thicke and double, and opening it selfe more, and
some so little double as but of two or three rowes, that they might be held to be single,
yet all of little or no smell at all. To describe you all the seuerall parts of the Rose, as
the bud, the beards, the threds <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> were needlesse, they are so conuersant in euery ones
hand, that I shall not neede but to touch the most speciall parts of the varieties of them,
and leaue a more exact relation of all things incident vnto them, vnto a generall worke.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosa Incarnata.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The Carnation Rose.</span>
</h4>

<p>The Carnation Rose is in most things like vnto the lesser white rose, both for the
growing of the stocke, and bignesse of the flower, but that it is more spreade abroade
when it is blown then the white is, and is of a pale blush colour all the flower thoroughout,
of as small a sent as the white one is almost.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosa Belgica
siue Vitrea.</i></div>

<p>This kinde of Rose is not very great, but very thicke and double, and is very variable
in the flowers, in that they will be so different one from another: some being paler then
others, and some as it were blasted, which commeth not casually, but naturally to this
rose: but the best flowers (whereof there will bee still some) will be of a bright pale
murrey colour, neere vnto the Veluet rose, but nothing so darke a colour.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosa Anglica rubra.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The English red Rose.</span>
</h4>

<p>The red Rose (which I call English not only for the reason before expressed, but be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>cause
(as I take it) this Rose is more frequent and vsed in England, then in other places)
neuer groweth so high as the damaske Rose bush, but most vsually abideth low, and
shooteth forth many branches from the roote (and is but seldome suffered to grow vp
as the damaske Rose into standards) with a greene barke, thinner set with prickles, and
larger and greener leaues on the vpperside then in the white, yet with an eye of white
vpon them, fiue likewise most vsually set vpon a stalke, and grayish or whitish vnderneath.
The Roses or Flowers doe very much vary, according to their site and abiding;
for some are of an orient, red or deepe crimson colour, and very double (although neuer
so double as the white) which when it is full blowne hath the largest leaues of any
other Rose; some of them againe are paler, tending somewhat to a damaske; and some
are of so pale a red, as that it is rather of the colour of the canker Rose, yet all for the
most part with larger leaues then the damaske, and with many more yellow threds in
the middle: the sent hereof is much better then in the white, but not comparable to
the excellencie of the damaske Rose, yet this Rose being well dryed and well kept, will
hold both colour and sent longer then the damaske, bee it neuer so well kept.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosa Damascena.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The Damaske Rose.</span>
</h4>

<p>The Damaske Rose bush is more vsually noursed vp to a competent height to stand
alone, (which we call Standards) then any other Rose: the barke both of the stocke
and branches, is not fully so greene as the red or white Rose: the leaues are greene with
an eye of white vpon them, so like vnto the red Rose, that there is no great difference betweene
them, but that the leaues of the red Rose seeme to bee of a darker greene. The
flowers are of a fine deepe blush colour, as all know, with some pale yellow threds in
the middle, and are not so thicke and double as the white, not being blowne, with so
large and great leaues as the red, but of the most excellent sweet pleasant sent, far surpassing
all other Roses or Flowers, being neyther heady nor too strong, nor stuffing or
vnpleasant sweet, as many other flowers.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosa Prouincialis siue Hollandica Damascena.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The great double Damaske Prouince or Holland Rose.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Rose (that some call <i>Centifolia Batauica incarnata</i>) hath his barke of a reddish
or browne colour, whereby it is soone discerned from other Roses. The leaues are
likewise more reddish then in others, and somewhat larger, it vsually groweth very
like the Damaske rose, and much to the same height: the flowers or roses are of the
same deepe blush colour that the damaske roses are, or rather somewhat deeper, but
much thicker, broader, and more double, or fuller of leaues by three parts almost, the
outer leaues turning themselues backe, when the flower hath stood long blowne, the
middle part it selfe (which in all other roses almost haue some yellow threds in them
to be seene) being folded hard with small leaues, without any yellow almost at all to be
seene, the sent whereof commeth neerest vnto the damaske rose, but yet is short of it
by much, howsoeuer many doe thinke it as good as the damask, and to that end I haue
known some Gentlewomen haue caused all their damaske stockes to bee grafted with
prouince Roses, hoping to haue as good water, and more store of them then of damask
Roses; but in my opinion it is not of halfe so good a sent as the water of damaske
Roses: let euery one follow their own fancie.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">6. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosa Prouincialis rubra.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The red Prouince Rose.</span>
</h4>

<p>As the former was called <i>incarnata</i>, so this is called <i>Batauica centifolia rubra</i>, the difference
being not very great: the stemme or stocke, and the branches also in this,
seeming not to be so great but greener, the barke being not so red; the leaues of the
same largenesse with the former damaske Prouince. The flowers are not altogether so
large, thicke and double, and of a little deeper damaske or blush colour, turning to a
red Rose, but not comming neere the full colour of the best red Rose, of a sent not so
sweete as the damaske Prouince, but comming somewhat neere the sent of the or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>dinary
red rose, yet exceeding it. This rose is not so plentifull in bearing as the
damaske Prouince.</p>

  <span class="line">7. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosa Prouincialis alba.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The white Prouince Rose.</span>

<p>It is said of diuers, that there is a white Prouince Rose, whereof I am not <i>oculatus
testis</i>, and therefore I dare not giue it you for a certaintie, and indeed I haue some doubt,
that it is the greater and more double white rose, whereof I gaue you the knowledge
in the beginning: when I am my selfe better satisfied, I shall bee ready to satisfie others.</p>

  <span class="line">The party coloured Rose,</span>
  <span class="line_split">of some Yorke and Lancaster.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Rose in the forme and order of the growing, is neerest vnto the ordinary
damaske rose, both for stemme, branch, leafe and flower: the difference consisting in
this, that the flower (being of the same largenesse and doublenesse as the damask rose)
hath the one halfe of it, sometimes of a pale whitish colour, and the other halfe, of a
paler damaske colour then the ordinary; this happeneth so many times, and sometimes
also the flower hath diuers stripes, and markes in it, as one leafe white, or striped with
white, and the other halfe blush, or striped with blush, sometimes also all striped, or
spotted ouer, and other times little or no stripes or markes at all, as nature listeth to
play with varieties, in this as in other flowers: yet this I haue obserued, that the longer
it abideth blowen open in the sun, the paler and the fewer stripes, markes or spots
will be seene in it: the smell whereof is of a weake damaske rose sent.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">9. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosea Chrystallina.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The Chrystall Rose.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Rose is very like vnto the last described, both for stocke, branch and leafe:
the flower hereof is not much different from it, being no great large or double Rose,
but of a meane size, striped and marked with a deeper blush or red, vpon the pale coloured
leafe, that it seemeth in the marking and beauty thereof, to bee of as much delight
as the Chrystall Gilloflower: this, euen like the former, soone fadeth and passeth
away, not yeelding any great store of flowers any yeare.</p>

  <span class="line">10. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosa rubra humilis siue pumilio.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The dwarfe red Rose, or Gilloflower Rose.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Rose groweth alwayes low and small, otherwise in most respects like vnto the
ordinary redde Rose, and with few or no thornes vpon it: the Flowers or Roses are
double, thicke, small and close, not so much spread open as the ordinary red, but
somewhat like vnto the first double white Rose before expressed; yet in some places
I haue seene them more layde open then these, as they grew in my garden, being so euen
at the toppes of the leaues, as if they had been clipt off with a paire of sheeres,
and are not fully of so red a colour as the red Prouince Rose, and of as small or weak
sent as the ordinary red Rose, or not so much.</p>

</h4>

<p>The young shootes of this Rose are couered with a pale purplish barke, set with a
number of small prickes like haires, and the elder haue but very few thornes: the
flower or rose it selfe hath a very great bud or button vnder it, more then in any other
rose, and is thicke and double as a red rose, but so strongly swelling in the bud, that many
of them breake before they can be full blowen, and then they are of a pale red rose
colour, that is, betweene a red and a damaske, with a very thicke broade and hard vmbone
of short yellow threds or thrumes in the middle, the huske of the flower hauing
long ends, which are called the beards of the rose, which in all other are iagged in
some of them, in this hath no iagge at all; the smell is neerest vnto a red Rose.</p>

</h4>

<p>The Hungarian Rose hath greene shootes slenderly set with prickes, and seldome
groweth higher then ordinarily the red Rose doth; the stemme or stocke being much
about that bignesse: the flower or rose is as great, thicke and double, as the ordinary
red Rose, and of the same fashion, of a paler red colour, and beeing neerely looked
vpon is finely spotted with faint spots, as it were spreade ouer the red; the smell wherof
is somewhat better then the smell of the ordinary red Rose of the best kinde.</p>

  <span class="line">The Veluet Rose single and double.</span>
</h4>

<p>The old stemme or stock of the veluet Rose is couered with a dark coloured barke,
and the young shootes of a sad greene with very few or no thornes at all vpon them:
the leaues are of a sadder greene colour then in most sorts of Roses, and very often
seuen on a stalke, many of the rest hauing but fiue: the Rose is eyther single or double:
the single is a broade spread flower, consisting of fiue or sixe broade leaues with many
yellow threds in the middle: the double hath two rowes of leaues, the one large,
which are outermost, the other smaller within, of a very deepe red crimson colour
like vnto crimson veluet, with many yellow threds also in the middle; and yet for all
the double rowe of leaues, these Roses stand but like single flowers: but there is another
double kinde that is more double then this last, consisting oftentimes of sixteene
leaues or more in a flower, and most of them of an equall bignesse, of the colour of
the first single rose of this kinde, or somewhat fresher; but all of them of a smaller

<p>The Rose without thornes hath diuers greene smooth shootes, rising from the root,
without any pricke or thorne at all vpon them, eyther young or old: the leaues are not
fully so large as of the red rose: the flowers or roses are not much bigger then those
of the double Cinamon Rose, thicke set together and short, of a pale red Rose colour,
with diuers pale coloured veines through euery leafe of the flower, which hath caused
some to call it The marbled Rose, and is of a small sent, not fully equall to the red
Rose. The single of this kinde differeth not in any other thing from the former, then
in the doublenesse or singlenesse of the flowers which in this are not halfe so double,
nor yet fully single, and are of a paler red colour.</p>

<p>The single Cinamon Rose hath his shootes somewhat red, yet not so red as the double
kinde, armed with great thornes, like almost vnto the Eglantine bush thereby
showing, as well by the multiplicitie of his shootes as the quicknesse and height of his
shooting, his wilde nature: On the stemme and branches stand winged leaues, sometimes
seuen or more together, which are small and greene, yet like vnto other Roses.
The Roses are single, of fiue leaues a peece, somewhat large, and of a pale red colour,
like vnto the double kinde, which is in shootes redder, and in all other things like vnto
the single, but bearing small, short, thicke and double Roses, somewhat like vnto
the Rose without thornes, but a little lesser, of a paler red colour at the end of the
leaues, and somewhat redder and brighter toward the middle of them, with many

<p>This single yellow Rose is planted rather for variety then any other good vse. It
often groweth to a good height, his stemme being great and wooddy, with few or no
prickes vpon the old wood, but with a number of small prickes like haires, thicke set,
vpon the younger branches, of a darke colour somewhat reddish, the barke of the
young shootes being of a sad greene reddish colour: the leaues of this Rose bush are
smaller, rounder pointed, of a paler greene colour, yet finely snipt about the edges,
and more in number, that is, seuen or nine on a stalke or ribbe, then in any other Garden
kinde, except the double of the same kinde that followeth next: the flower is a
small single Rose, consisting of fiue leaues, not so large as the single Spanish Muske
Rose, but somewhat bigger then the Eglantine or sweete Briar Rose, of a fine pale yellow

  <span class="line">The double yellow Rose.</span>
</h4>

<p>The double yellow Rose is of great account, both for the rarity, and doublenesse of
the flower, and had it sent to the rest, would of all other be of highest esteeme. The
stemme or stocke, the young shoots or branches, the small hairy prickes, and the small
winged leaues, are in all parts like vnto the former single kinde; the chiefest difference
consisteth in the doublenesse of the flower or Rose, which is so thicke and double,
that very often it breaketh out on one side or another, and but a few of them abiding
whole and faire in our Countrey, the cause whereof wee doe imagine to bee the
much moisture of our Countrey, and the time of flowring being subiect to much
raine and showers; many therefore doe either plant it against a wall, or other wayes
defend it by couering: againe, it is so plentifull in young shootes or branches, as also
in flowers at the toppe or euery branch, which are small and weake for the most part,
that they are not able to bring all the flowers to ripenesse; and therefore most of them
fall or wither away without comming to perfection (the remedy that many doe vse
for this inconuenience last recited is, that they nippe away most of the buds, leauing
but some few vpon it, that so the vigour of the plant may be collected into a few flowers,
whereby they may the better come to perfection, and yet euen thus it is hardly
effected) which are of a yellowish greene colour in the bud, and before they be blowne
open, but then are of a faire yellow colour, very full of leaues, with many short haires
rather then leaues in the middle, and hauing short, round, greene, smooth buttons, almost
flat vnder them: the flower being faire blowne open, doth scarce giue place for
largenesse, thicknesse, and doublenesse, vnto the great Prouence or Holland Rose.
This Rose bush or plant is very tender with vs here about London, and will require
some more care and keeping then the single of this kinde, which is hardy enough; for
I haue lost many my selfe, and I know but a few about this towne that can nourse it vp
kindly, to beare or scarce to abide without perishing; but abideth well in euery free
aire of all or the most parts of this Kingdome: but (as I heare) not so well in the North.</p>

<p>The Muske Rose both single and double, rise vp oftentimes to a very great height,
that it ouergroweth any arbour in a Garden, or being set by an house side, to bee ten
or twelue foote high, or more, but more especially the single kinde, with many green
farre spread branches, armed with a few sharpe great thornes, as the wilder sorts of
Roses are, whereof these are accounted to be kindes, hauing small darke greene leaues
on them, not much bigger then the leaues of Eglantine: the flowers come forth at the
toppes of the branches, many together as it were in an vmbell or tuft which for the
most part doe flower all at a time, or not long one after another, euery one standing
on a pretty long stalke, and are of a pale whitish or creame colour, both the single and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>

threads in the middle: and the double bearing more double flowers, as if they
were once or twice more double then the single, with yellow thrummes also in the

  <span class="line">The great Apple Rose.</span>
</h4>

<p>The stemme or stocke of this Rose is great, couered with a darke grayish barke, but
the younger branches are somewhat reddish, armed here and there with great and
sharpe thornes, but nothing so great or plentifull as in the Eglantine, although it be a
wilde kinde: the leaues are of a whitish greene colour, almost like vnto the first white
Rose, and fiue alwaies set together, but seldome seuen: the flowers are small and single,
consisting of fiue leaues, without any sent, or very little, and little bigger then
those of the Eglantine bush, and of the very same deepe blush colour, euery one standing
vpon a rough or prickly button, bearded in the manner of other Roses, which
when the flowers are fallen growe great, somewhat long and round, peare-fashion,
bearing the beards on the tops of them; and being full ripe are very red, keeping the
small prickles still on them, wherein are many white, hard, and roundish seedes, very
like vnto the seede of the Heppes or Eglantine Berries, lying in a soft pulpe, like vnto
the Hawthorne berries or Hawes: the whole beauty of this plant consisteth more in
the gracefull aspect of the red apples or fruit hanging vpon the bushes, then in the
flowers, or any other thing. It seemeth to be the same that Clusius calleth <i>Rosa Pumila</i>,
but that with me it groweth much higher and greater then he saith his doth.</p>

  <span class="line">The single Eglantine or sweete Briar bush.</span>
</h4>

<p>The sweete Briar or Eglantine Rose is so well knowne, being not onely planted in
Gardens, for the sweetenesse of the leaues, but growing wilde in many woods and
hedges, that I thinke it lost time to describe it; for that all know it hath exceeding long

that are noursed vp in Gardens, seuen or nine most vsually set together on a ribbe or
stalke, very greene and sweete in smell, aboue the leaues of any other kinde of Rose:
the flowers are small single blush Roses, of little or no sent at all, which turne into
reddish berries, stuffed within with a dounie or flock matter or substance, wherein
doth lye white hard seede.</p>

</h4>

<p>The double Eglantine is in all the places that I haue seene it a grafted Rose, (but I
doubt not, but that his originall was naturall, and that it may be made naturall againe,
as diuers other Roses are.) It groweth and spreadeth very well, and with a great head
of branches, whereon stand such like leaues as are in the single kinde, but a little larger,
not smelling fully so sweete as it: the flowers are somewhat bigger then the single, but
not much, hauing but one other rowe of leaues onely more then the former, which
are smaller, and the outer leaues larger, but of the same pale reddish purple colour,
and smelleth somewhat better then the single.</p>

  <span class="line">The euer greene Rose bush.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Rose or bush is very like vnto a wilde single Eglantine bush in many respects,
hauing many very long greene branches, but more slender and weake, so that many
times they bend downe againe, not able to sustaine themselues without some helpe,
and armed with hooked thornes as other Roses be; the winged leaues consist of seuen
for the most part, whereof those two that are lowest and opposite, are smallest, the
next two bigger then they, the third couple bigger then any of the rest belowe, and
the end leafe biggest of all: this proportion generally it holdeth in euery winged leafe
through the whole plant, which at the first comming forth are somewhat reddish, with
the young branch that shooteth out with them, but being full growne, are of a deepe
greene colour, and somewhat shining, dented about the edges, and fall not away from
the branches as other Roses doe, but abide thereon for the most part all the Winter:
the flowers stand foure or fiue together at the tops of the branches, being single Roses,
made of fiue leaues a peece, of a pure white colour, much larger then the ordinary
Muske Rose, and of a fine sent, comming nearest thereunto, with many yellow chiues
or threads in the middle.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>Some of these Roses had their originall, as is thought in England, as the
first and second; for these dryed red Roses that come ouer to vs from beyond
the Seas, are not of the kinde of our red Rose, as may well be perceiued
by them that will compare our English dryed leaues with those. Some
in Germany, Spaine, and Italy. Some againe in Turkie, as the double yellow
Rose, which first was procured to be brought into England, by Master
Nicholas Lete, a worthy Merchant of London, and a great louer of flowers,
from Constantinople, which (as wee heare) was first brought thither
from Syria; but perished quickly both with him, and with all other to
whom hee imparted it: yet afterwards it was sent to Master Iohn de Franqueuille,
a Merchant also of London, and a great louer of all rare plants, as
well as flowers, from which is sprung the greatest store, that is now flourishing
in this Kingdome.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The Cinamon Rose is the earliest for the most part, which flowreth with
vs about the middle of May, and sometimes in the beginning. The ordinary
Muske Roses both single and double flower latest, as is said. All the other
flower much about one time, in the beginning of Iune, or thereabouts, and
continue flowring all that moneth, and the next throughout for the most
part, and the red vntill August be halfe past.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The seuerall names, whereby they are most commonly knowne vnto vs
in this Countrey, are expressed in their titles; but they are much differing
from what they are called in other Countries neare vnto vs, which to compare,
conferre, and agree together, were a worke of more paines then vse:
But to proportion them vnto the names set downe by Theophrastus, Pliny,
and the rest of the ancient Authors, were a worke, wherein I might be sure
not to escape without falling into errour, as I verily beleeue many others
haue done, that haue vndertaken to doe it: I will therefore for this worke
desire that you will rest contented, with so much as hath already been deliuered,
and expect an exact definition and complete satisfaction by such a
methodicall course as a generall History will require, to be performed by
them that shall publish it.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The Rose is of exceeding great vse with vs; for the Damaske Rose (besides
the superexcellent sweete water it yeeldeth being distilled, or the perfume
of the leaues being dryed, seruing to fill sweete bags) serueth to cause
solublenesse of the body, made into a Syrupe, or preserued with Sugar moist
or dry candid. The Damaske Prouince Rose, is not onely for sent nearest
of all other Roses vnto the Damaske, but in the operation of solubility also.
The red Rose hath many Physicall vses much more then any other, seruing
for many sorts of compositions, both cordiall and cooling, both binding
and loosing. The white Rose is much vsed for the cooling of heate in the
eyes: diuers doe make an excellent yellow colour of the iuyce of white Roses,
wherein some Allome is dissolued, to paint or colour flowers or pictures,
or any other such things. There is little vse of any other sort of Roses;
yet some affirme, that the Muske Roses are as strong in operation to
open or loosen the belly as the Damaske Rose or Prouince.</p>

<p>The male <i>Cistus</i> that is most familiar vnto our Countrey, I meane that will best abide,
is a small shrubby plant, growing seldome aboue three or foure foote high with
vs, hauing many slender brittle wooddy branches, couered with a whitish barke,
whereon are set many whitish greene leaues, long and somewhat narrow, crumpled
or wrinckled as it were with veines, and somewhat hard in handling, especially the
old ones; for the young ones are softer, somewhat like vnto Sage leaues for the
forme and colour, but much smaller, two alwaies set together at a ioynt: the flowers
stand at the toppe of the branches, three or foure together vpon seuerall slender footstalkes,
consisting of fiue small round leaues a peece, somewhat like vnto a small single
Rose, of a fine reddish purple colour, with many yellow threads in the middle, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>out
any sent at all, and quickly fading or falling away, abiding seldome one whole
day blowne at the most: after the flowers are past, there come vp round hard hairie
heads in their places, containing small brownish seede: the roote is wooddy, and
will abide some yeares with vs, if there be some care had to keepe it from the extreamity
of our Winters frostes, which both this, and many of the other sorts and kinds,

<p>The female Holly Rose groweth lower, and smaller then the former male kinde,
hauing blackish branches, lesse woody, but not lesse brittle then it: the leaues are somewhat
rounder and greener, but a little hard or rough withall, growing in the same manner
vpon the branches by couples: the flowers grow at the toppes of the branches,
like vnto the former, consisting of fiue leaues, but somewhat lesser, and wholly white,

of leaues that are long and narrow, very like vnto the leaues of the French Spikenard
or <i>Spica Celtica</i>; from among which leaues shoote forth short stalkes, not aboue a span
high, with a few smaller leaues thereon; and at the toppes diuers small flowers one aboue
another, consisting of six small round leaues, of a yellow colour, hauing two circles
of reddish spots round about the bottome of the leaues, a little distant one from
another, which adde much grace to the flower: after the flowers are past, there come
in their places small round heads, being two forked at the end containing within them
small brownish chaffie seede: the roote is small and slender, with many fibres thereat
creeping vnder ground, and shooting forth in diuers places, whereby it much encreaseth:

Cistus or Ledon, being a little clammy withall: at the toppe of the stalkes, and at the

long and narrow darke greene leaues, but whitish vnderneath, two alwayes standing
together at a ioint, both stalks and leaues bedeawed as it were continually with a clammy
sweete moisture (which in the hot Countries is both more plentifull, and more
sweet then in ours) almost transparent, and which being gathered by the inhabitants,
with certaine instruments for that purpose (which in some places are leather thongs,
drawne ouer the bushes, and after scraped off from the thongs againe, and put together)
is that kind of blacke sweet gum, which is called <i>Ladanum</i> in the Apothecaries
shops; at the tops of the branches stand single white flowers, like vnto single Roses,
being larger then in any of the former kindes, consisting of fiue leaues, whereof euery
one hath at the bottome a dark purplish spot, broad below, and small pointed vpwards,
with some yellow threds in the middle: after which are past, there arise cornered
heads, containing such small brownish seede as is in the former male kinde: the roote
is woody, and spreadeth vnder ground, abiding some yeares, if it be placed vnder a

<p>The fragrant smell with properties correspondent of two other plants, causeth me
to insert them in this Chapter, and to bring them to your knowledge, as well worthy
a fit place in our Garden. The first of them hath diuers slender woody branches, two
foote high or thereabouts, couered with a grayish coloured barke, and many times
leaning downe to the ground, whereby it taketh roote againe: vpon these branches
grow many thicke, short, hard greene leaues, thicke set together, confusedly without
order, sometimes whitish vnderneath, and sometimes yellowish: the toppes of the
branches are loden with many flowers, which cause them to bend downwards, being
long, hollow and reddish, opening into fiue corners, spotted on the outside with many
white spots, and of a paler red colour on the inside, of a fine sweet sent: after the
flowers are past, there follow small heads, containing small brownish seede: the root
is long, hard and woody, abiding better if it comprehend in the ground, then some of
the former, because his originall is out of a colder country.</p>

  <span class="line">7. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ledum Silesiacum.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The sweete Mary Rose, or Rosemary of Silesia.</span>
</h4>

<p>This other sweete plante riseth vp with woody ash-coloured branches two foote
high or more, which shoote forth other branches, of a reddish or purplish colour, couered
with a brownish yellow hoarinesse, on which are set many narrow long greene
leaues, like vnto Rosemary leaues, but couered with the like hoarinesse as the stalks are
(especially in the naturall places, but not so much being transplanted) and folding the
sides of the leaues so close together, that they seeme nothing but ribbes, or stalkes, of
an excellent sweet and pleasant sent; at the ends of the branches there grow certaine
brownish scaly heads, made of many small leaues set thicke together, out of which
breake forth many flowers, standing in a tuft together, yet seuerally euery one vpon
his owne footstalke, consisting of fiue white leaues, with certaine white threds in the
middle, smelling very sweete: after which rise small greene heads, spotted with
brownish spots, wherein is contained very small, long, yellowish seede: the roote is
hard and woodie.</p>

Germanie, Bohemia.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They do all flower in the Summer moneths of Iune, Iuly and August, and
their seede is ripe quickly after.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first, second, fourth and fift, haue their names sufficiently expressed
in their descriptions. The third was sent vnto Clusius, vnder the name of
<i>Hirculus Frisicus</i>, because of the strong sent: but he referreth it to the kinds
of <i>Chamæcistus</i>, that is, dwarfe or low <i>Cistus</i>, both for the low growth, and
for the flowers and seede sake. The sixt is diuersly called; for Clusius calleth
it <i>Ledum Alpinum</i>: others, <i>Nerium Alpinum</i>, making it to bee a Rose Bay.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>Gesner according to the Countrey peoples name, <i>Rosa Alpina</i>, and <i>Rosa
Montana</i>. Lobel calleth it <i>Balsamum Alpinum</i>, of the fragrant smell it hath,
and <i>Chamærhododendros Chamælææfolio</i>. And some haue called it <i>Euonymus</i>,
without all manner of iudgement. In English wee may call it, The Mountaine
Rose, vntill a fitter name be giuen it. The last is called of Matthiolus,
<i>Rosmarinum siluestre</i>, but of Clusius <i>Ledum</i>, referring it to their kindred;
and <i>Silesiacum</i>, because he found it in that Countrey; or for distinction sake,
as he saith, it may bee called, <i>Ledum folijs Rosmarini</i>, or <i>Ledum Bohemicum</i>.
Cordus, as it seemeth in his History of Plants, calleth it <i>Chamæpeuce</i>, as
though he did account it a kinde of low Pine, or Pitch tree.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The first, second, and fift, are very astringent, effectuall for all sorts of
fluxes of humours. The sweet Gum called <i>Ladanum</i>, made artificially into
oyle, is of singular vse for <i>Alopecia</i>, or falling of the haire. The seed of the
fourth is much commended against the stone of the Kidneyes. The sweete
Rosemary of Silesia is vsed of the inhabitants, where it naturally groweth,
against the shrinking of sinewes, crampes, or other such like diseases, whereof
their daily experience makes it familiar, being vsed in bathing or otherwise.</p>

been planted in Noblemens, and great mens gardens against bricke wals, and there
continued long) as beyond the Seas, in the naturall places where it groweth, that it riseth
vp in time vnto a very great height, with a great and woody stemme (of that compasse,
that (being clouen out into thin boards) it hath serued to make lutes, or such like
instruments, and here with vs Carpenters rules, and to diuers other purposes) branching
out into diuers and sundry armes that extend a great way, and from them againe
into many other smaller branches, whereon are set at seueral distances, at the ioynts, many
very narrow long leaues, greene aboue, and whitish vnderneath; among which
come forth towards the toppes of the stalkes, diuers sweet gaping flowers, of a pale or
bleake blewish colour, many set together, standing in whitish huskes; the seed is small
and red, but thereof seldome doth any plants arise that will abide without extraordinary
care; for although it will spring of the seede reasonable well, yet it is so small

stalkes, not so easie to breake, fairer, bigger and larger leaues, of a faire greene colour,
and the flowers are double, as the Larkes heele or spurre: This I haue onely by
relation, which I pray you accept, vntill I may by sight better enforme you.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>Our ordinary Rosmary groweth in Spaine, and Prouence of France,
and in others of those hot Countryes, neere the Sea side. It will not abide
(vnlesse kept in stoues) in many places of Germany, Denmarke, and those
colder Countries. And in some extreame hard winters, it hath well neere
perished here in England with vs, at the least in many places: but by slipping
it is vsually, and yearly encreased, to replenish any garden.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>It flowreth oftentimes twice in the yeare; in the Spring first, from April
vntill the end of May or Iune, and in August and September after, if the
yeare before haue been temperate.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>Rosmary is called of the ancient Writers, <i>Libanotis</i>, but with this distinction,
<i>Stephanomatica</i>, that is, <i>Coronaria</i>, because there were other plants called
<i>Libanotis</i>, that were for other vses, as this for garlands, where flowers
and sweete herbes were put together. The Latines call it <i>Rosmarinum</i>. Some
would make it to be <i>Cneorum nigrum</i> of Theophrastus, as they would make
Lauander to bee his <i>Cneorum album</i>, but Matthiolus hath sufficiently confuted
that errour.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>Rosmary is almost of as great vse as Bayes, or any other herbe both for
inward and outward remedies, and as well for ciuill as physicall purposes.
Inwardly for the head and heart; outwardly for the sinewes and ioynts:
for ciuill vses, as all doe know, at weddings, funerals, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> to bestow among
friends: and the physicall are so many, that you might bee as well tyred in
the reading, as I in the writing, if I should set down all that might be said of
it. I will therefore onely giue you a taste of some, desiring you will be content
therewith. There is an excellent oyle drawne from the flowers alone
by the heate of the Sunne, auaileable for many diseases both inward and
outward, and accounted a soueraigne Balsame: it is also good to helpe dim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>nesse
of sight, and to take away spots, markes and scarres from the skin; and
is made in this manner. Take a quantitie of the flowers of Rosemary, according
to your owne will eyther more or lesse, put them into a strong glasse
close stopped, set them in hot horse dung to digest for fourteene dayes,
which then being taken forth of the dung, and vnstopped, tye a fine linnen
cloth ouer the mouth, and turne downe the mouth thereof into the mouth
of another strong glasse, which being set in the hot Sun, an oyle will distill
downe into the lower glasse; which preserue as precious for the vses before
recited, and many more, as experience by practice may enforme diuers.</p>

<p>There is another oyle Chymically drawne, auaileable in the like manner
for many the same inward and outward diseases, <i>viz.</i> for the heart, rheumaticke
braines, and to strengthen the memory, outwardly to warme and comfort
cold benummed sinewes, whereof many of good iudgement haue had
much experience.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">I<span class="looks_big">n</span> the hot Countreyes, there haue been many sorts of Mirtles found out, naturally
growing there, which will not fructifie in this of ours, nor yet abide without extraordinary
care, and conueniencie withall, to preserue them from the sharpenesse
of our winters. I shall only bring you to view three sorts in this my Garden, the one
with a greater, the other two with lesser leaues, as the remainder of others which wee
haue had, and which are preserued from time to time, not without much paine and
trouble.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myrtus latifolia.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The greater leafed Mirtle.</span>
</h4>

<p>The broader leafed Mirtle riseth vp to the height of foure or fiue foote at the most
with vs, full of branches and leaues growing like a small bush, the stemme and elder
branches whereof are couered with a dark coloured bark, but the young with a green,
and some with a red, especially vpon the first shooting forth, whereon are set many
fresh greene leaues, very sweet in smell, and very pleasant to behold, so neer resembling
the leaues of the Pomegranate tree that groweth with vs, that they soone deceiue many
that are not expert therein, being somewhat broade and long, and pointed at the
ends, abiding alwaies green: at the ioynts of the branches where the leaues stand, come
forth the flowers vpon small footestalkes, euery one by it selfe consisting of fiue small
white leaues, with white threds in the middle, smelling also very sweet; after the flowers
are past, there doe arise in the hot Countries, where they are naturall, round blacke
berries, when they are ripe, wherein are contained many hard white crooked seedes,
but neuer in this Countrey, as I said before: the roote disperseth it selfe into many
branches, with many fibres annexed thereto.</p>

  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myrtus minor, seu minore folio.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The smaller leafed Mirtle.</span>
</h4>

<p>The smaller leafed Mirtle is a low shrub or bush, like vnto the former, but scarce rising
so high, with branches spreading about the stemme, much thicker set with leaues
then the former, smaller also, and pointed at the ends, of a little deeper greene colour,
abiding greene also winter and summer, and very sweete likewise: the flowers are
white like vnto the former, and as sweete, but shew not themselues so plentifull on the
branches: the fruit is blacke in his naturall places, with seedes therein as the former.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myrtus minor rotundiore folio.</i></span>

<p>Wee haue another sort of this small kinde of Mirtle, so like vnto the former both
for smalnesse, deepe greene colour of the leaues, and thicke growing of the branches,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
that it will be thought of most, without good heede, and comparing the one with the other,
to be the very same with the former: but if it bee well viewed, it will shew, by the
roundnesse at the ends of the leaues very like vnto the small Boxe leaues, to be another
differing kinde, although in nothing else. Wee nourse them with great care, for the
beautifull aspect, sweete sent and raritie, as delights and ornaments for a garden of pleasure,
wherein nothing should be wanting that art, care and cost might produce and preserue:
as also to set among other euer greene plants to sort with them.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>These, and many other sorts of Mirtles grow in Spaine, Portugall, Italie,
and other hot Countries in great aboundance, where they make their hedges
of them: wee (as I said) keepe them in this Countrey, with very great
care and diligence.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The Mirtles doe flower very late with vs, not vntill August at the soonest,
which is the cause of their not fructifying.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>They are called in Latine <i>Myrtus</i>, and in English Mirtle tree, without any
other diuersitie of names, for the generall title. Yet the seuerall kindes haue
had seuerall denominations, in Plinies time, and others, as <i>Romana</i>, <i>Coniugala</i>,
<i>Tarentina</i>, <i>Egyptia</i>, <i>alba</i>, <i>nigra</i>, <i><abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></i> which haue noted the differences, euen
then well obserued.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

fruit, which is distinguished of some into two sorts, of others into three, that
is, into sower, and sweet, and into sower sweete. The other wilde, which beareth
no fruite, because it beareth double flowers, like as the Cherry, Apple, and Peach
tree with double blossomes, before described, and is also distinguished into two sorts,
the one bearing larger, the other lesser flowers. Of the manured kinde wee haue onely
one sort (so farre as we know, for it neuer beareth ripe fruit in this our Countrey) which
for the beautifull aspect, both of the greene verdure of the leaues, and faire proportion
and colour of the flowers, as also for the raritie, are noursed in some few of their gardens
that delight in such rarities: for in regard of the tendernesse, there is neede of diligent
care, that is, to plant it against a brick wall, and defend it conueniently from the
sharpenesse of our winters, to giue his Master some pleasure in seeing it beare flowers:
And of the double kinde we haue as yet obtained but one sort, although I shall giue you

  <span class="line">The tame Pomegranet tree.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Pomegranet tree groweth not very high in his naturall places, and with vs somtimes
it shooteth forth from the roote many brownish twigges or branches, or if it bee
pruned from them, and suffered to grow vp, it riseth to bee seuen or eight foote high,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
spreading into many small and slender branches, here and there set with thornes, and
with many very faire greene shining leaues, like in forme and bignesse vnto the leaues
of the larger Myrtle before described, euery one hauing a small reddish foote-stalke
vpon these branches: among the leaues come forth here and there, long, hard, and
hollow reddish cups, diuided at the brimmes, wherein doe stand large single flowers,
euery one consisting of one whole leafe, smaller at the bottome then at the brimme,
like bels, diuided as it were at the edges into fiue or six parts, of an orient red or crimson
colour in the hotter Countries; but in this it is much more delayed, and tendeth
neare vnto a blush, with diuers threads in the middle. The fruit is great and round, hauing
as it were a crowne on the head of it, with a thicke tough hard skinne or rinde, of
a brownish red colour on the outside, and yellow within, stuffed or packt full of small
graines, euery one encompast with a thin skin, wherein is contained a clear red iuyce
or liquor, either of a sweet (as said before) or sower taste, or betweene them both of
a winie taste: the roote disperseth it selfe very much vnder ground.</p>

  <span class="line">The greater wilde or double blossomd Pomegranet tree.</span>
</h4>

<p>The wilde Pomegranet is like vnto the tame in the number of purplish branches,
hauing thornes, and shining faire greene leaues, somewhat larger then the former:
from the branches likewise shoote forth flowers, farre more beautifull then
those of the same or manured sort, because they are double, and as large as a double
Prouince Rose, or rather more double, of an excellent bright crimson colour, tending
to a silken carnation, standing in brownish cups or huskes, diuided at the brims vsually
into foure or fiue seuerall points, like vnto the former, but that in this kinde there neuer
followeth any fruit, no not in the Country, where it is naturally wilde.</p>

<p>This smaller kinde differeth from the former in his leaues, being of a darker greene
colour, but not in the height of the stemme, or purplishnesse of his branches, or thorns
vpon them; for this doth shew it selfe more like vnto a wilde kind then it: the flowers
hereof are much smaller, and not so thicke and double, of a deeper or sadder red Orenge
tawny colour, set also in such like cups or huskes.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The tame or manured kinde groweth plentifully in Spaine, Portugall,
and Italy, and other in other warme and hot countries. Wee (as I said before)
preserue it with great care. The wilde I thinke was neuer seene in
England, before Iohn Tradescante my very louing good friend brought it
from the parts beyond the Seas, and planted it in his Lords Garden at
Canterbury.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower very late with vs, that is, not vntill the middle or end of
August, and the cold euenings or frosts comming so soone vpon it, doth
not onely hinder it from bearing, but many times the sharpe winters so
pinch it, that it withereth it downe to the ground, so that oftentimes it
hardly springeth againe.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The name <i>Malus Punica</i> for the tree, and <i>Malum Punicum</i> for the fruit, or
<i>Malus Granata</i>, and <i>Malum Granatum</i>, is the common name giuen vnto this
tree, which is called in English the Pomegarnet or Pomegranet tree. The
flowers of the tame kinde are called <i>Cytini</i>, as Dioscorides saith, although
Plinie seemeth either to make <i>Cytinus</i> to be the flower of the wilde kinde, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
<i>Balaustium</i> to be the flower of both tame and wilde kinde: but properly, as
I take it, <i>Cytinus</i> is the cup wherein the flower as well of the tame as wilde
kinde doth stand; for vnto the similitude of them, both the flowers of <i>Asarum</i>,
and the seede vessels of <i>Hyosciamus</i> are compared and resembled, and
not vnto the whole flower: the barke or rinde of the fruit is called of diuers
<i>Sidion</i>, and in the Apothecaries shops <i>Psidium</i>, and <i>cortex Granatorum</i>. The
wilde kinde is called <i>Malus Punica siluestris</i>: In English, The wilde Pomegranet
tree; the flower thereof is properly called <i>Balaustium</i>. The lesser kind
is vsually called <i>Balaustium Romanum</i>, as the greater is called <i>Creticum</i> and
<i>Cyprium</i>, because they growe in Candy and Cyprus.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The vse of all these Pomegranets is very much in Physicke, to coole and
binde all fluxibility both of body and humours: they are also of singular
effect in all vlcers of the mouth, and other parts of the body, both of man
and woman. There is no part of them but is applyed for some of these respects.
The rinde also of the Pomegranet is vsed of diuers in stead of Gaules,
to make the best sort of writing Inke, which is durable to the worlds end.</p>

<p>I haue adioyned this plant, for the pleasurable beauty of the greene leaues, and red
berries. It groweth vp to be a yard or foure foote high at the most, hauing a small
wooddy stemme or stocke, as bigge as ones finger or thumbe, couered with a whitish
greene barke, set full of greene branches, and faire greene leaues, somewhat vneuen
sometimes on the edges, narrower then any Night shade leaues, and very neare
resembling the leaues of the <i>Capsicum</i>, or Ginny pepper, but smaller and narrower, falling
away in the Winter, and shooting fresh in the Spring of the yeare: the flowers
growe often two or three together, at the ioynts of the branches with the leaues, being
white, opening starre-fashion, and sometimes turning themselues backe, with a yellow
pointell in the middle, very like vnto the flowers of Night shade: after the flowers
are past, come forth in their stead small greene buttons, which after turne to be
pleasant round red berries, of the bignesse of small Cherries when they are ripe,
which with vs vsually ripen not vntill the Winter, or about Christmas, wherein are
contained many small whitish seede that are flat: all the whole plant, as well leaues
and flowers as seede, are without either smell or taste: the roote hath many yellowish
strings and fibres annexed vnto it.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The originall place hereof is not well knowne, but is thought to bee the
West Indies. It hath been planted of long time in most of these Countries,
where it abideth reasonable well, so that some care bee had thereof in the

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>This plant hath diuers names; for it is thought to be that kinde of <i>Amomum</i>
that Plinie setteth downe. Dodonæus calleth it <i>Pseudocapsicum</i>, for
some likenesse in the leafe and fruit vnto the small <i>Capsicum</i> or Ginnie Pepper,
although much vnlike in the taste and property. Others doe call it
<i>Strichnodendron</i>, that is, <i>Solanum arborescens</i>, and wee in English according
thereunto, Tree Night shade. But some Latin asses corrupting the Latine
word <i>Amomum</i>, doe call it the Mumme tree. Dalechampius calleth it <i>Solanum
Americum, seu Indicum</i>, and saith the Spaniards call it in their tongue,
<i>Guindas de las Indias</i>, that is, <i>Cerasa Indiana</i>, Indian Cherries, which if any
would follow, I would not bee much against it: but many Gentlewomen,
doe call them Winter Cherries, because the fruit is not throughly ripe vntill
Winter.</p>

into many branches of leaues, and all of them growing out of one leafe, put into
the ground halfe way, which taking roote, all the rest rise out thereof, those belowe
for the most part being larger then those aboue; yet all of them somewhat long, flat,
and round pointed, of the thicknesse of a finger vsually, and smallest at the lower end,
where they are ioyned or spring out of the other leaues, hauing at their first breaking
out a shew of small, red, or browne prickes, thicke set ouer all the vpper side of the
leaues, but with vs falling away quickly, leauing onely the markes where they stood:
but they haue besides this shew of great prickes, a few very fine, and small, hard, white,

which will often sticke in their fingers that handle them vnaduisedly, neither are they

out of the vppermost leaues breake forth certaine greene heads, very like vnto leaues
(so that many are deceiued, thinking them to be leaues, vntill they marke them better,
and be better experienced in them) but that they growe round and not flat, and are
broad at the toppe; for that out of the tops of euery of them shooteth out a pale yellow
flower, consisting of two rowes of leaues, each containing fiue leaues a peece,
laid open with certaine yellow threads, tipt with red in the middle: this greene head,

them shew the hollownesse which they haue in the toppe or middle of the head, the
sides round about being raised or standing vp higher: this head or figge in our Country
abideth greene on the outside, and little or nothing reddish within (although it abide

reddish on the outside, and containing within it a bloudy red clammy iuyce, making
the vrine of them that eate of them as red as bloud, which many seeing, were in doubt

in the naturall places, I am not well assured, yet affirmed: but those that haue beene
brought vnto me, whose colour on the outside was greenish, were of a reddish purple

they descipher out the manner of the growing of this plant, yet because
this is a kinde of tree, and not an herbe, nor to be eaten, it cannot bee
the same: but especially because there is an herbe which groweth in the

Sea Purslane is one) which Clusius calleth <i>Lychen Marinus</i>, and (as Clusius

same <i>Opuntia</i> that Theophrastus maketh mention of, and Plinie out of
him. Our English people in Virginia, and the Bermuda Island, where it
groweth plentifully, because of the form of the fruit, which is somewhat like
to a Peare, &amp; not being so familiarly acquainted with the growing of Figs,
sent it vnto vs by the name of the prickly Peare, from which name many

and spreadeth abroad many armes and branches, which againe send forth many smaller
twigges, bending downewards; from which twiggy or slender branches, being
flat themselues like the leaues, come forth on both sides many flat winged leaues, somewhat
like vnto Sauine, being short and small, but not pricking, seeming as if they
were brayded or folded like vnto a lace or point, of a darke yellowish greene colour,
abiding greene on the branches Winter and Summer, of a strong resinous taste, not
pleasing to most, but in some ready to procure casting, yet very cordiall and pectorall

dounie flowers, set in small scaly heads, wherein lye small, long, brownish seede,
which ripen well in many places, and being sowne, doe spring and bring forth plants,
which with some small care will abide the extreamest Winters we haue.</p>

<p>The first or originall place where it naturally groweth, as farre as I can
learne or vnderstand, is that part of America which the French doe inhabite,
about the riuer of Canada, which is at the backe of Virginia Northward,
and as it seemeth, first brought by them from thence into Europe, in
the time of Francis the first French King, where it hath so plentifully encreased,
and so largely beene distributed, that now few Gardens of respect,
either in France, Germany, the Lowe Countries, or England, are without it.</p>

<p>All the Writers that haue written of it, since it was first knowne, haue
made it to be <i>Thuyæ genus</i>, a kinde of Thuya, which <cite>Theophrastus compareth
vnto a Cypresse tree, in his fifth Book and fifth Chapter</cite>: but <i>Omne simile
non est idem</i>, and although it haue some likenesse, yet I verily beleeue it is
<i>proprium sui genus</i>, a proper kinde of it owne, not to bee paralleld with any
other. For wee finde but very few trees, herbes, or plants in America,
like vnto those that growe in Europe, the hither part of Africa, or in the
lesser Asia, as experience testifieth. Some would make it to be <i>Cedrus Lycia</i>,
but so it cannot be. The French that first brought it, called it <i>Arbor vitæ</i>,
with what reason or vpon what ground I know not; but euer since it hath
continued vnder the title of the Tree of life.</p>

<p>It hath beene found by often experience, that the leaues hereof chewed
in the morning fasting, for some few dayes together, haue done much good
to diuers, that haue beene troubled with shortnesse of breath, and to helpe
to expectorate thinne purulentous matter stuffing the lungs. Other properties
I haue not heard that it hath; but doubtlesse, the hot resinous smell and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>

doth euidently declare his tenuity of parts, a digesting and cleansing quality

free from other trees (as in a Garden at Batthersey, which sometimes agoe belonged
to Master Morgan, Apothecary to the late Queene Elizabeth of famous memory)
to be a very great and tall tree, exceeding any Apple tree in height, and equall
in bignesse of body thereunto (as my selfe can testifie, being an eye witnesse thereof)
when as it had many stalkes of flowers, being in the bud, breaking out of the body of
the tree through the barke in diuers places, when as there was no bough or branch near
them by a yard at the least, or yet any leafe vpon the tree, (which they gathered to put
among other flowers, for Nosegayes) and in other places it groweth to bee but an
hedge bush, or plant, with many suckers and shootes from belowe, couered with a
darke reddish barke, the young branches being more red or purplish: the flowers on
the branches come forth before any shew or budding of leaues, three or foure standing
together vpon a small foote-stalke, which are in fashion like vnto Pease blossomes,
but of an excellent deepe purplish crimson colour: after which come in their
places so many long, flat, large, and thinne cods, of a brownish colour, wherein are
contained small, blackish browne, flat, and hard seede: the roote is great, and runneth
both deepe, and farre spreading in the earth: the leaues come forth by themselues,
euery one standing on a long stalke, being hard &amp; very round, like vnto the leafe
of the largest <i>Asarum</i>, but not so thick, of a whitish green on the vpper side, and grayish

come in, and the buds of flowers are sprung.</p>

<p>There is another of this kinde, growing in some places very high, somewhat like
the former, and in other places also full of twiggy branches, which are greener then
the former, as the leaues are likewise: the flowers of this kinde are wholly white, and
the cods nothing so red or browne, in all other things agreeing together.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The former groweth plentifully in many places of Spaine, Italy, Prouence
in France, and in many other places. The other hath beene sent vs
out of Italy many times, and the seede hath sprung very well with vs, but it
is somewhat tender to keepe in the Winter.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The flowers (as I said) appeare before the leaues, and come forth in Aprill
and May, and often sooner also, the leaues following shortly after;

<p>Some would referre this to <i>Cercis</i>, whereof <cite>Theophrastus maketh mention
in his first Booke and eighteenth Chapter</cite>, among those trees that beare
their fruit in cods, like as Pulse doe: and hee remembreth it againe in <cite>the
fourteenth Chapter of his third Booke</cite>, and maketh it not vnlike the white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
Poplar tree, both in greatnesse and whitenesse of the branches, with the leafe
of an Iuie, without corners on the one part, cornered on the other, and
sharpe pointed, greene on both sides almost alike, hauing so slender long
footestalkes that the leaues cannot stand forthright, but bend downwards,
with a more rugged barke then the white Poplar tree. Clusius thinketh this
large description is but an ample description of the third kinde of Poplar,
called <i>Lybica</i>, the Aspen tree, which Gaza translateth <i>Alpina</i>: but who so
will well consider it, shall finde it neyther answerable to any Poplar tree, in
that it beareth not cods as <i>Cercis</i> doth; nor vnto this <i>Arbor Iudæ</i>, because it
beareth not white branches. Clusius saith also, that the learned of Mompelier
in his time, referred it to <i>Colytea</i> of <cite>Theophrastus in his third booke
and seuenteenth chapter</cite>, where he doth liken it to the leaues of the broadest
leafed Bay tree, but larger and rounder, green on the vpperside, and whitish
vnderneath, and whereunto (as he saith) <cite>Theophrastus giueth cods in the
fourteenth chapter of the same third booke</cite>: and by the contracting of their
descriptions both together, saith, they agree vnto this Iudas tree. But I find
some doubts and differences in these places: for the <i>Colutæa</i> that <cite>Theophrastus
mentioneth in the said fourteenth chapter of his third booke</cite>, hath (as
he saith there) a leafe like vnto the Willow, and therefore cannot bee the
same <i>Colutæa</i> mentioned in the <cite>seuenteenth chapter of the same third book</cite>,
which hath a broade Bay leafe: indeede hee giueth seede in cods: but
that with broade Bay leaues is (as he saith) without eyther flower or fruite;
and besides all this, he saith the rootes are very yellow, which is not to bee
found in this <i>Arbor Iudæ</i>, or Iudas tree: let others now iudge if these things
can bee well reconciled together. Some haue for the likenesse of the cods
vnto Beane cods, called it <i>Fabago</i>. And Clusius called it <i>Siliqua siluestris</i>.
It is generally in these dayes called <i>Arbor Iudæ</i>, and in English after the Latine

in cods like vnto pulse as that doth. Of some it hath beene taken for a kinde
of <i>Cytisus</i>, but not truely. We call it in English, Beane Trefoile, in regard

riseth vp to the height of a man at the most, with a body of the bignesse of a
mans thumbe, couered with a whitish bark, breaking forth into many whitish branches
spreading farre, beset in many places with small leaues, three alwayes set together vpon

much smaller, fashioned somewhat like vnto the former, with a reddish stripe downe
the backe of the vppermost leafe: the long cods that follow are small, long and round,
distinguished into many diuisions or dents, like vnto a Scorpions tayle, from whence
hath risen the name: in these seuerall diuisions lye seuerall blacke seede, like vnto the
seede of Fenigrecke: the roote is white and long, but not so woody as the former.</p>

  <span class="line">The lesser Scorpion Bastard Sena.</span>
</h4>

<p>This lesser Bastard Sena is in all things like the former, but somewhat lower, and
smaller both in leafe, flower, and cods of seede, which haue not such eminent bunches
on the cods to be seene as the former.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>They grow as Matthiolus saith about Trent in Italie, and in other places:
the former is frequent enough through all our Countrey, but the others
are more rare.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower about the middle or end of May, and their seede is ripe in
August. The bladders of the first will abide a great while on the tree, if
they be suffered, and vntill the winde cause them to rattle, and afterwards
the skins opening, the seede will fall away.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The name <i>Colutæa</i> is imposed on them, and by the iudgement of most
writers, the first is taken to bee that <i>Colutæa</i> of <i>Lipara</i> that <cite>Theophrastus maketh
mention of, in the seuenteenth chapter of his third booke</cite>. But I should
rather thinke that the <i>Scorpioides</i> were the truer <i>Colutæa</i> of Theophrastus,
because the long pods thereof are more properly to bee accounted <i>filiquæ</i>,
then the former which are <i>vesicæ tumentes</i>, windy bladders, and not <i>filiquæ</i>:
and no doubt but Theophrastus would haue giuen some peculiar note of
difference if he had meant those bladders, and not these cods. Let others of
iudgement be vmpeeres in this case; although I know the currant of writers
since Matthiolus, doe all hold the former <i>Colutæa vesicaria</i> to be the true <i>Colutæa
Liparæ</i> of Theophrastus. Wee call it in English, Bastard Sena, from
Ruellius, who as I thinke first called it Sena, from the forme of the leaues.
The second and third (as I said before) from the forme of the cods receiued
their names, as it is in the titles and descriptions; yet they may as properly
be called <i>Siliquosæ</i>, for that their fruite are long cods.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>Theophrastus saith it doth wonderfully helpe to fatten sheepe: But sure
it is found by experience, that if it be giuen to man it causeth strong purgings
both vpwards and downwards; and therefore let euery one beware that
they vse not this in steede of good Sena, lest they feele to their cost the
force thereof.</p>

euen this very hardly, I shall leaue all others, and describe vnto you this one
only in this manner: Spanish Broome groweth to bee fiue or sixe foote high, with a
woody stemme below, couered with a darke gray, or ash-coloured barke, and hauing
aboue many pliant, long and slender greene twigs, whereon in the beginning of the

flowers, but larger, as yellow as they, and smelling very well; after which come small
long cods, crested at the backe, wherein is contained blackish flat seede, fashioned
very like vnto the Kidney beanes: the roote is woody, dispersing it selfe diuers waies.</p>

<p>It is called <i>Spartium Græcorum</i>, and <i>Spartum frutex</i>, to distinguish it from

thought not to differ from the other <i>Genista</i>, but they are much deceiued;
for euen in Spaine and Italie, the ordinary <i>Genista</i> or Broome groweth with
it, which is not pliant, and fit to binde Vines, or such like things withall
as this is.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

thinne skinne, to the number of twenty, and sometimes thirty or forty, euery one
with a long foote-stalke, hanging downe their heads for the most part, especially
those that are outermost, euery one standing within a small huske of greene leaues,
turned to the stalkeward, like vnto the Lysimachia flower of Virginia before described,
and each of them consisting of fiue small leaues a peece, of a pale-purplish

<p>It flowreth in Iuly, and the seede is ripe in August.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>It may seeme very probable to many, that this plant is the same that <cite>Prosper
Alpinus in the twenty fift Chapter of his Booke of Egyptian plants</cite>,
nameth <i>Beidelsar</i>; and <cite>Honorius Bellus in his third and fourth Epistles vnto
Clusius (which are at the end of his History of plants)</cite> calleth <i>Ossar frutex</i>:
And Clusius himselfe in the same Booke calleth <i>Apocynum Syriacum</i>,
<i>Palæstinum</i>, and <i>Ægyptiacum</i>, because this agreeth with theirs in very many
and notable parts; yet verily I thinke this plant is not the same, but rather
another kinde of it selfe: First, because it is not <i>frutex</i>, a shrub or wooddy
plant, nor keepeth his leaues all the yeare, but loseth both leaues and stalks,
dying down to the ground euery yeare: Secondly, the milke is not causticke
or violent, as Alpinus and Bellus say <i>Ossar</i> is: Thirdly, the cods are more
crooked then those of Clusius, or of Alpinus, which Honorius Bellus acknowledgeth
to be right, although greater then those he had out of Egypt:
And lastly, the rootes of these doe runne, whereof none of them make any
mention. Gerard in his herball giueth a rude figure of the plant, but a very
true figure of the cods with seede, and saith the Virginians call it <i>Wisanck</i>,
and referreth it to the <i>Asclepias</i>, for the likenesse of the cods stuffed with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>silken doune. But what reason Caspar Bauhinus in his <i>Pinax Theatri Botanici</i>
had, to call it (for it is Clusius his <i>Apocynum Syriacum</i>) by the name of
<i>Lapathum Ægyptiacum lactescens siliqua Asclepiadis</i>, I know none in the
world: for but that he would shew an extreame singularity in giuing names
to plants, contrary to all others (which is very frequent with him) how
could he thinke, that this plant could haue any likenesse or correspondencie,
with any of the kindes of Dockes, that euer he had seene, read, or heard
of, in face, or shew of leaues, flowers, or seede; but especially in giuing
milke. I haue you see (and that not without iust and euident cause) giuen it
a differing Latine name from Gerard, because the <i>Asclepias</i> giueth no milke,
but the <i>Periploca</i> or <i>Apocymum</i> doth; and therefore fitter to be referred to
this then to that. And because it should not want an English name answerable
to some peculiar property thereof, I haue from the silken doune called
it Virginian Silke: but I know there is another plant growing in Virginia,
called Silke Grasse, which is much differing from this.</p>

hereof. <cite>Captaine Iohn Smith in his booke of the discouery and description

<p>There is great controuersie among the moderne Writers concerning this
plant, some taking it to be <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύπρος</span> of Dioscorides, other to be <i>Phillyrea</i> of Dioscorides,
which followeth next after <i>Cyprus</i>. Plinie maketh mention of
<i>Cyprus</i> in two places; in the one he saith <i>Cyprus</i> hath the leafe of <i>Ziziphus</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>or the Iuiube tree: in the other he saith, that certain do affirme, that the <i>Cyprus</i>
of the East Country, and the <i>Ligustrum</i> of Italy is one and the same plant:
whereby you may plainly see, that our Priuet which is <i>Ligustrum</i>, cannot be
that <i>Cyprus</i> of Plinie with Iuiube leaues: Besides, both Dioscorides &amp; Plinie
say, that <i>Cyprus</i> is a tree; but all know that <i>Ligustrum</i>, Priuet, is but an hedge
bush: Againe, Dioscorides saith, that the leaues of <i>Cyprus</i> giue a red colour,
but Priuet giueth none. Bellonius and Prosper Alpinus haue both recorded,
that the true <i>Cyprus</i> of Dioscorides groweth plentifully in Egypt, Syria,
and those Easterne Countries, and noursed vp also in Constantinople,
and other parts of Greece, being a merchandise of much worth, in that they
transport the leaues, and young branches dryed, which laid in water giue a
yellow colour, wherewith the Turkish women colour the nailes of their
hands, and some other parts of their bodies likewise, delighting much
therein: and that it is not our <i>Ligustrum</i>, or Priuet, because <i>Cyprus</i> beareth
round white seede, like Coriander seede, and the leaues abide greene alwaies
vpon the tree, which groweth (if it bee not cut or pruined) to the
height of the Pomegranet tree. I haue (I confesse) beyond the limits I set for
this worke spoken concerning our Priuet, because I haue had the seede of
the true <i>Cyprus</i> of Dioscorides sent mee, which was much differing from
our Priuet, and although it sprang vp, yet would not abide any time,
whereas if it had beene our Priuet, it would haue beene familiar enough

<p>Vnto all these flowers of beauty and rarity, I must adioyne two other plants,
whose beauty consisteth in their leaues, and not in their flowers: as also to separate
them from the others of their tribe, to place them here in one Chapter,
before the sweete herbes that shall follow, as is fittest to furnish this our Garden of
pleasure. This kinde of Sage groweth with branches and leaues, very like the ordinary
Sage, but somewhat smaller, the chiefest difference consisteth in the colour of
the leaues, being diuersly marked and spotted with white and red among the greene:
for vpon one branch you shall haue the leaues seuerally marked one from another, as
the one halfe of the leafe white, and the other halfe greene, with red shadowed ouer
them both, or more white then greene, with some red in it, either parted or shadowed,
or dasht here and there, or more greene then white, and red therein eyther in the middle
or end of the leafe, or more or lesse parted or striped with white and red in the
greene, or else sometimes wholly greene the whole branch together, as nature listeth
to play with such varieties: which manner of growing rising from one and the same
plant, because it is the more variable, is the more delightfull and much respected.</p>

<p>There is another speckled Sage parted with white and greene, but it is nothing of
that beauty to this, because this hath three colours euidently to bee discerned in euery
leafe almost, the red adding a superaboundant grace to the rest.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">B<span class="looks_big">a</span>ssill is of two sorts (besides other kindes) for this our Garden, the one whereof

  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ocimum Citratum.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Common Bassill.</span>
</h4>

<p>Our ordinary Garden Bassill hath one stalke rising from the root, diuersly branched
out, whereon are set two leaues alwayes at a ioynt, which are broad, somewhat round,
and pointed, of a pale greene colour, but fresh, a little snipt or dented about the edges,
and of a strong or heady sent, somewhat like a Pomecitron, as many haue compared
it, and thereof call it <i>Citratum</i>: the flowers are small and white, standing at the tops of
the branches, with two smal leaues at euery ioynt vnder them, in some plants green, in o<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>thers
browne vnder them: after which commeth blacke seede: the roote perisheth
at the first approach of winter weather, and is to be new sowen euery yeare.</p>

  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ocimum minimum siue Gariophyllatum.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Bush Basill.</span>
</h4>

<p>The bush Basill groweth not altogether so high, but is thicker spreade out into
branches, whereon grow smaller leaues, and thicker set then the former, but of a more
excellent and pleasant smell by much: the flowers are white like the former, and the
seede blacke also like it, and perisheth as suddenly, or rather sooner then it, so that it
requireth more paines to get it, and more care to nourse it, because we seldome or neuer
haue any seede of it.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ocimum Indicum.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Indian Basill.</span>
</h4>

<p>The Indian Basill hath a square reddish greene stalke, a foote high or better, from
the ioynts whereof spreade out many branches, with broade flat leaues set thereon,
two alwayes together at the ioynt, one against another, as other Basils haue, but somewhat
deepely cut in on the edges, and oftentimes a little crumpled, standing vpon long
reddish footestalkes, of a darke purple colour, spotted with deeper purple spots, in
some greater, in others lesser: the flowers stand at the tops of the stalkes spike-fashion,
which are of a white colour, with reddish stripes and veines running through them, set
or placed in darke purple coloured huskes: the seede is greater and rounder then the
former, and somewhat long withall: the roote perisheth in like manner as the other
former doe. The whole plant smelleth strong, like vnto the other Basils.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The two last sorts of Basils are greater strangers in our Country then the
first which is frequent, and only sowen and planted in curious gardens. The
last came first out of the West Indies.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They all flower in August, or Iuly at the soonest, and that but by degrees,
and not all at once.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is vsually called <i>Ocimum vulgare</i>, or <i>vulgatius</i>, and <i>Ocimum Citratum</i>.
In English, Common or Garden Basill. The other is called <i>Ocimum
minimum</i>, or <i>Gariophyllatum</i>, Cloue Basill, or Bush Basill. The last eyther of
his place, or forme of his leaues, being spotted and curled, or all, is called
<i>Ocimum Indicum maculatum</i>, <i>latifolium</i> &amp; <i>crispum</i>. In English according to the
Latine, Indian Basill, broade leafed Basill, spotted or curled Basill, which
you please.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The ordinary Basill is in a manner wholly spent to make sweet, or washing
waters, among other sweet herbes, yet sometimes it is put into nosegayes.
The Physicall properties are, to procure a cheerefull and merry heart, whervnto
the seede is chiefly vsed in pouder, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and is most vsed to that, and
to no other purpose.</p>

  <span class="line sub-title">Sweete Marierome.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">W<span class="looks_big">e</span>e haue many sorts of Marierome; some that are sweete, and but Summer
plants; others that are greater and not so sweet; and some also that
are wilde. Of all these I will onely select some of the choisest that are
fit for this place, and leaue the other for the next garden, and the garden of simples, or
a generall worke: yet hereunto I will adioyne another sweete plant called Masticke,
as participating neerer with them then with Time, whereunto many doe referre it.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maiorana maior æstiua.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Common sweet Marierome.</span>
</h4>

<p>The sweet Marierome that is most frequently sowen in our Country, is a low herbe
little aboue a foote high when it is at the highest, full of branches, and small whitish
soft roundish leaues, smelling very sweet: at the toppes of the branches stand diuers
small scaly heads, like vnto knots, (and therefore of some called knotted Marierome)
of a whitish greene colour, out of which come here and there small white flowers, and
afterwards small reddish seede: the roote is composed of many small threds or strings,
which perish with the whole plant euery yeare.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maiorana tenuifolia.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Marierome gentle.</span>
</h4>

<p>This Marierome hath likewise diuers small branches, growing low, and not higher
then the former, but hauing finer and smaller leaues, hoary and soft, but much sweeter:
the heads are like vnto the former, and so are the flowers and seede, and the whole
plant abiding but a Summer in the like manner.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Marum.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Herbe Masticke.</span>
</h4>

<p>The neerer resemblance that this herbe hath with Marierome then with Tyme (as
I said before) hath made me place it next vnto the small sweet Marierome. It riseth vp
with a greater, and a more woody stalke then Marierome, two foote high or better in
some places, where it liketh the ground and ayre, branching out on all sides towards
the vpper part, leauing the stemme bare below, if it bee old, otherwise being young,
thinly furnishing the branches from the bottome with small greene leaues, bigger then
the leaues of any Tyme, and comming neere vnto the bignesse and forme of the last
recited finer Marierome, but of a greener colour: at the toppes of the branches stand
small white flowers on a head, which afterwards turne into a loose tuft of a long white
hoary matter, like vnto soft doune, with some leaues vnderneath and about it, which
abide not long on the stalkes, but are blowne away with the winde: the seede is so
small if it haue any, that I haue not obserued it: the roote is threddy: the whole plant
is of a sweete resinous sent, stronger then the Marierome, and abideth our winters, if
it be carefully planted and regarded.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The sweete Marieromes grow naturally in hot Countreyes: the first in
Spaine <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> the second is thought to come out of Syria, or Persia first into
Italie, where they much esteeme it, and plant it curiously and carefully in
pots, and set them in their windowes, beeing much delighted therewith for
the sweet sent it hath. The first is vsually sowen euery yeare in most gardens
with vs: but the second is very rare and daintie, and must as daintely be preserued
being more tender then the former. The herbe Masticke is thought
to be first brought out of Candie, Clusius saith he found it in Spaine: It is
planted by slippes, (and not sowen) in many gardens, and is much replanted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>for increase, but prospereth onely, or more frequently, in loamie or clay
grounds then in any other soyle.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The sweete Marieromes beare their knots or scaly heads in the end of Iuly,
or in August. Herbe Masticke in Iune many times, or in the beginning
of Iuly.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first of the two sweet Marieromes called <i>Maiorana</i> in Latine <i>à maiore
cura</i>, is taken of most writers to be the <i>Amaracus</i> or <i>Sampsuchum</i> of Dioscorides,
Theophrastus and Plinie, although Galen doth seem a little to dissent
therefrom. The other sweet Marierome hath his name in his title as much
as can be said of it. The next is thought by the best of the moderne Writers
to be the true <i>Marum</i> that Galen preferreth for the excellent sweetnesse, before
the former Marierome in making the <i>Oleum</i>, or <i>vnguentum Amaricinum</i>,
and seemeth to incline to their opinion that thought <i>Amaracus</i> was deriued
from <i>Marum</i>. It is the same also that Galen and others of the ancient Writers
make mention of, to go into the composition of the <i>Trochisci Hedychroi</i>,
as well as <i>Amaracus</i> among the ingredients of the <i>Theriaca Andromachi</i>. In
English we call it Masticke simply, or Herbe Mastick, both to distinguish it
from that Tyme that is called Masticke Tyme, and from the Masticke
Tree, or Gum, so called. Some of later times, and Clusius with them, haue
thought this to be Dioscorides his <i>Tragoriganum</i>, which doth somewhat resemble
it: but there is another plant that Matthiolus setteth forth for <i>Marum</i>,
that in Lobels opinion and mine is the truest <i>Tragoriganum</i>, and this
the truest <i>Marum</i>.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The sweete Marieromes are not onely much vsed to please the outward
senses in nosegayes, and in the windowes of houses, as also in sweete pouders,
sweete bags, and sweete washing waters, but are also of much vse in
Physicke, both to comfort the outward members, or parts of the body, and
the inward also: to prouoke vrine being stopped, and to ease the paines
thereof, and to cause the feminine courses. Herbe Masticke is of greater
force to helpe the stopping of vrine, then the Marierome, and is put into
Antidotes, as a remedie against the poyson of venemous Beasts.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are many kindes of Tyme, as they are vsually called, with vs, some are
called of the garden, and others wilde, which yet for their sweetnesse are
brought into gardens, as Muske Tyme, and Lemon Tyme; and some for their
beauty, as embroidered or gold yellow Tyme, and white Tyme. But the true Tyme
of the ancient Writers, called <i>Capitatum</i>, as a speciall note of distinction from all other
kindes of Tyme, is very rare to be seene with vs here in England, by reason of the
tendernesse, that it will not abide our Winters. And all the other sorts that with vs
are called garden Tymes, are indeede but kindes of wilde Tyme, although in the defect
or want of the true Tyme, they are vsed in the stead of it. With the Tymes I must
doe as I did with the Marieromes in the <a href="#Chap_2_CXXXI" title="go to Pleasant Flowers Chapter 131">Chapter before</a>, that is, reserue the most common
in vse, for the common vse of the Kitchen, and shew you only those here, that are

  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thymum legitimum capitatum.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The true Tyme.</span>
</h4>

<p>The true Tyme is a very tender plant, hauing hard and hoary brittle branches,
spreading from a small wooddy stemme, about a foote and a halfe high, whereon are
set at seuerall ioynts, and by spaces, many small, long, whitish, or hoary greene leaues,
of a quicke sent and taste: at the tops of the branches stand small long whitish greene
heads, somewhat like vnto the heads of <i>Stæchas</i>, made as it were of many leaues or
scales, out of which start forth small purplish flowers (and in some white, as Bellonius
saith) after which commeth small seede, that soone falleth out, and if it be not carefully
gathered, is soone lost, which made (I thinke) Theophrastus to write, that this
Tyme was to be sowne of the flowers, as not hauing any other seede: the root is small
and wooddy. This holdeth not his leaues in Winter, no not about Seuill in Spaine,
where it groweth aboundantly, as Clusius recordeth, finding it there naked or spoiled
of leaues. And will not abide our Winters, but perisheth wholly, roote and all.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Serpillum hortense siue maius.</i></span>

<p>The wilde Tyme that is cherished in gardens groweth vpright, but yet is lowe, with
diuers slender branches, and small round greene leaues, somewhat like vnto small fine
Marierome, and smelling somewhat like vnto it: the flowers growe in roundels at the
toppes of the branches, of a purplish colour: And in another of this kinde they are
of a pure white colour.</p>

<p>There is another also like hereunto, that smelleth somewhat like vnto Muske; and
therefore called Muske Tyme, whose greene leaues are not so small as the former,
but larger and longer.</p>

<p>The wilde Tyme that smelleth like vnto a Pomecitron or Lemon, hath many weake
branches trayling on the ground, like vnto the first described wilde Tyme, with small
darke greene leaues, thinly or sparsedly set on them, and smelling like vnto a Lemon,
with whitish flowers at the toppes in roundels or spikes.</p>

with small party coloured leaues vpon them, diuided into stripes or edges, of a gold

placing of the yellow, hath caused it to be called embroidered or guilded Tyme.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first groweth as is said before, about Seuill in Spaine, in very great
aboundance as Clusius saith; and as Bellonius saith, very plentifully on the

and some in others: but wee preserue them with all the care wee can in our

<p>The true Tyme is a speciall helpe to melancholicke and spleneticke diseases,
as also to flatulent humours, either in the vpper or lower parts of the
body. The oyle that is Chimically drawne out of ordinary Tyme, is vsed

It is also much vsed for the toothach, as many other such like hot

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are many varieties of Hyssope, beside the common or ordinary, which
I reserue for the Kitchen garden, and intend onely in this place to giue you
the knowledge of some more rare: <i>viz.</i> of such as are noursed vp by those
that are curious, and fit for this garden: for there are some other, that must be remembred
in the Physicke garden, or Garden of Simples, or else in a generall worke.</p>

  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hyssopus folijs niueis.</i></span>
  <span class="line">White Hyssope.</span>
</h4>

<p>This white Hyssope is of the same kinde and smell with the common Hyssope; but
differeth, in that this many times hath diuers leaues, that are wholly of a white colour,
with part of the stalke also: others are parted, the one halfe white, the other halfe
greene, and some are wholly greene, or with some spots or stripes of white within the
greene, which makes it delightfull to most Gentlewomen.</p>

  <span class="line">Russet Hyssope.</span>

<p>As the last hath party coloured leaues, white and greene, so this hath his leaues of
an ash-colour, which of some is called russet; and hath no other difference either in
forme or smell.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hyssopus aureus.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Yellow or golden Hyssope.</span>

<p>All the leaues of this Hyssope are wholly yellow, or but a little greene in them, and
are of so pleasant a colour, especially in Summer, that they prouoke many Gentlewomen
to weare them in their heads, and on their armes, with as much delight as many
fine flowers can giue: but in Winter their beautifull colour is much decayed, being of
a whitish greene, yet recouer themselues againe the next Summer.</p>

  <span class="line">Double Hyssope.</span>

<p>As this kinde of Hyssope groweth lower then the former or ordinary kinde, so it
hath more branches, slenderer, and not so wooddy, leaning somewhat downe toward
the ground, so wonderfully thicke set with leaues, that are like vnto the other, but of a
darker greene colour, and somewhat thicker withall, that it is the onely fine sweete
herbe, that I know fittest (if any be minded to plant herbes) to set or border a knot of
herbes or flowers, because it will well abide, and not growe too wooddy or great, nor
be thinne of leaues in one part, when it is thicke in another, so that it may be kept with
cutting as smooth and plaine as a table. If it be suffered to growe vp of it selfe alone,
it riseth with leaues as before is specified, and flowreth as the common doth, and of
the same sent also, not differing in any thing, but in the thicknesse of the leaues on the
stalkes and branches, and the aptnesse to be ordered as the keeper pleaseth.</p>

  <span class="line">Germander.</span>
</h4>

<p>Lest Germander should be vtterly forgotten, as not worthy of our Garden, seeing
many (as I said in my treatise or introduction to this Garden) doe border knots therewith:
let me at the least giue it a place, although the last, being more vsed as a strewing
herbe for the house, then for any other vse. It is (I thinke) sufficiently knowne to haue
many branches, with small and somewhat round endented leaues on them, and purplish
gaping flowers: the rootes spreading far abroad, and rising vp againe in many places.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>These Hyssopes haue beene most of them noursed vp of long time in our
English Gardens, but from whence their first originall should be, is not well
knowne. The Germander also is onely in Gardens, and not wilde.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>They flower in Iune and Iuly.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The seuerall names whereby they are knowne to vs, are set forth in their
titles; and therefore I neede not here say more of them then onely this, that
neyther they here set downe, nor the common or ordinary sort, nor any of
the rest not here expressed, are any of them the true Hyssope of the ancient
Greeke Writers, but <i>supposititiæ</i>, vsed in the stead thereof. The Germander,
from the forme of the leaues like vnto small oaken leaues, had the name <i>Chamædrys</i>
giuen it, which signifieth a dwarfe Oake.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>The common Hyssope is much vsed in all pectorall medicines, to cut
fleagme, and to cause it easily to be auoided. It is vsed of many people in
the Country, to be laid vnto cuts or fresh wounds, being bruised, and applyed
eyther alone, or with a little Sugar. It is much vsed as a sweet herbe,
to be in the windowes of an house. I finde it much commended against the
Falling Sicknesse, especially being made into Pils after this manner: Of
Hyssope, Horhound, and Castor, of each halfe a dramme, of Peony rootes
(the male kinde is onely fit to be vsed for this purpose) two drams, of <i>Assafætida</i>
one scruple: Let them be beaten, and made into pils with the iuyce
of Hyssope; which being taken for seuen dayes together at night going to
bed, is held to be effectual to giue much ease, if not thoroughly to cure those
that are troubled with that disease. The vse of Germander ordinarily is as
Tyme, Hyssope, and other such herbes, to border a knot, whereunto it is
often appropriate, and the rather, that it might be cut to serue (as I said) for
a strewing herbe for the house among others. For the physicall vse it serueth
in diseases of the splene, and the stopping of vrine, and to procure womens courses.</p>

<h4 class="faux nobreak">{Conclusion}</h4>

<p>Thus haue I led you through all my Garden of Pleasure, and shewed you all the varieties
of nature noursed therein, pointing vnto them, and describing them one after
another. And how lastly (according to the vse of our old ancient Fathers) I bring
you to rest on the Grasse, which yet shall not be without some delight, and that not
the least of all the rest.</p>

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are among an infinite number (as I may so say) of Grasses, a few onely
which I thinke fit to be planted in this Garden, both for the rarity of them,
and also for your delight, and the excellent beauty that is in them aboue many
other plants. One of them hath long agoe bin respected, and cherished in the country
gardens of many Gentlewomen, and others. The others are knowne but vnto a few.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gramen striatum.</i></span>
  <span class="line">Painted Grasse or Ladies laces.</span>
</h4>

<p>This kinde of Grasse hath many stiffe, hard, round stalkes, full of ioynts, whereon
are set at euery ioynt one long leafe, somewhat broad at the bottome, where it compasseth
the stalke, and smaller to the end, where it is sharpe pointed, hard or rough in
handling, and striped all the length of the leafe with white streakes or lines, that they
seeme party coloured laces of white and greene: the tops of the stalkes are furnished
with long spikie tufts, like vnto the tufts of Couch Grasse: the rootes are small, white,
and threddy, like the rootes of other Grasses.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gramen Plumarium minus.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The lesser Feather-Grasse.</span>
</h4>

<p>This lesser Feather-Grasse hath many small, round, and very long leaues or blades,
growing in tufts, much finer and smaller then any other Grasse that I know, being almost
like vnto haires, and of a fresh greene colour in Summer, but changing into gray,
like old hay in Winter, being indeede all dead, and neuer reuiuing; yet hardly to be
plucked away vntill the Spring, and then other greene leaues or rushes rise vp by them,
and in their stead, and are aboue a foote in length: from the middle of these tufts come
forth rounder and bigger rushes, which are the stalkes, and which haue a chaffie round
eare about the middle thereof, which when it is full growne, is somewhat higher then
the toppes of the leaues or rushes, opening it selfe (being before close) at the top, and
shewing forth three or foure long ayles or beards, one aboue another, which bend
themselues a little downewards (if they stand ouer long before they are gathered, and
will fall off, and be blowne away with the winde) being so finely feathered on both
sides, all the length of the beard, and of a pale or grayish colour, that no feather in the
taile of the Bird of Paradise can be finer, or to be compared with them, hauing sticking
at the end of euery one of them, within the eare, a small, long, whitish, round, hard,
and very sharpe pointed graine, like vnto an oaten graine, that part of the stalke of the
feather that is next vnder it, and aboue the seede for some two or three inches, being
stiffe and hard, and twining or curling it selfe, if it be suffered to stand too long, or to
fall away, otherwise being straight as the feather it selfe: the roote is composed of
many long, hard, small threddy strings, which runne deepe and far, and will not willingly
be remoued, in that it gaineth strength euery yeare by standing.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gramen Plumarium maius.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The greater Feather-Grasse.</span>
</h4>

<p>The greater Feather-Grasse is like vnto the lesser, but that both the leaues and the
feathers, are greater, and nothing so fine, grosser also, and of lesse beauty and respect,
though whiter then it; and therefore is not so much regarded: for I haue knowne, that
many Gentlewomen haue vsed the former lesser kinde, being tyed in tufts, to set them
in stead of feathers about their beds, where they haue lyen after childe-bearing, and at
other times also, when as they haue been much admired of the Ladies and Gentles that
haue come to visit them.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Place.</h4>

<p>The first of these Grasses, as Lobel saith, groweth naturally in the woods
and hils of Sauoy. It hath long agoe beene receiued into our English gar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>dens.
The second, as Clusius saith, in Austria, from whence also (as I take
it) the greater came, and are both in the gardens of those, that are curious
obseruers of these delights.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Time.</h4>

<p>The first is in its pride for the leaues all the Spring and Summer, yeelding
his bush in Iune. The other giue their feather-like sprigs in Iuly and
August, and quickly (as I said) are shed, if they be not carefully gathered.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Names.</h4>

<p>The first is called by Lobel <i>Gramen sulcatum</i>, or <i>striatum album</i>; of others
<i>Gramen pictum</i>. The French call it <i>Aiguellettes d’armes</i>, of the fashion that
their Ensignes, Pennons, or Streamers vsed in wars were of, that is, like
vnto a party coloured curtaine. In English vsually Ladies laces, and Painted
Grasse. The first of the other two is called <i>Gramen plumarium</i> or <i>plumosum</i>,
and <i>minus</i> is added for the distinction of it. Clusius calleth it <i>Spartum
Austriacum</i>, of the likenesse and place where he found it. The last is, called
<i>Gramen plumarium</i>, or <i>plumosum maius</i>, The greater Feather-Grasse.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vertues.</h4>

<p>These kindes of Grasses are not in any time or place that I doe heare of
applyed to any Physicall vse; and therefore of them I will say no more:
but here I will end the prime part of this worke.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-h.jpg" alt="H">
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">H<span class="looks_big">a</span>uing giuen you the best rules and instructions that I can for your
flower Garden, and all the flowers that are fit to furnish it, I now
proceede to your herbe garden, which is not of the least respect
belonging to any mans house, nor vtterly to bee neglected for the
many vtilities are to be had from it, both for the Masters profit and
pleasure, and the meynies content and nourishment: all which if
I should here set down, I had a large field to wander in, and matter
sufficient to entreat of, but this worke permitteth not that libertie:
and I thinke there are but few but eyther know it already, or conceiue it sufficiently in
their minds. Passing therefore no further in such discourses, I come to the matter in
hand, which is to shew you where the fittest place is for an herbe garden. As before I
shewed you that the beautie of any worthy house is much the more commended for
the pleasant situation of the garden of flowers, or of pleasure, to be in the sight and full
prospect of all the chiefe and choisest roomes of the house; so contrariwise, your herbe
garden should bee on the one or other side of the house, and those best and choyse
roomes: for the many different sents that arise from the herbes, as Cabbages, Onions,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> are scarce well pleasing to perfume the lodgings of any house; and the many ouertures
and breaches as it were of many of the beds thereof, which must necessarily bee,
are also as little pleasant to the sight. But for priuate mens houses, who must like their
habitations as they fall vnto them, and cannot haue time or meanes to alter them, they
must make a vertue of necessity, and conuert their places to their best aduantage, by
making their profit their chiefest pleasure, and making one place serue for all vses. The
choyce of ground for this Garden, is (as I said before) where it is fat, fertill and good,
there needeth the lesse labour and cost; and contrariwise, where it is cold, wet, dry or
barren, there must bee the more helpes still added to keepe it in heart. For this Garden
by reason of the much and continuall stirring therein, the herbes and rootes drawing
out the substance of the fertilitie thereof more aboundantly then in the former, must
be continually holpen with soyle, or else few things of goodnesse or worth will come
forward therein. The stable soyle of horses is best and most proper for any colde
grounds, for being the hottest, it will cause any the seedes for this Garden to prosper
well, and be more forward then in any other ground that is not so holpen. The stable
soyle of Cattell is of a colder and moister nature, and is therefore more proper for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
the hot sandy or grauelly grounds, and although it bee longer before it bee brought to
mould then that of horses, yet it will outlast it more then twice so long. Let euery one
therefore take according to the nature of the ground such helpes as are most fit and
conuenient, as I haue here and before shewed. But I doe here ingenuously confesse my
opinion of these forcings and helpings of ground, that howsoeuer it doth much good
to some particular things, which because they delight in heate, and cannot be brought
to perfection without it in this our Countrey, which is colder then their naturall from
whence they are brought, must therefore haue artificiall helpes to forward them; yet
for many other things the compost doth much alter and abate the naturall vigour, and
quickenesse of taste, that is perceiued in them that grow in a naturall fat or sandy soile
that is not so holpen.</p>

<i class="sub-title">The forme of a Garden of herbes for necessary vses,
with the ordering thereof.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">A<span class="looks_big">s</span> our former Garden of pleasure is wholly formable in euery part with
squares, trayles, and knots, and to bee still maintained in their due forme and
beautie: so on the contrary side this Garden cannot long conserue any forme,
for that euery part thereof is subiect to mutation and alteration. For although it is
conuenient that many herbes doe grow by themselues on beds, cast out into some proportion
fit for them, as Tyme, Hissope, Sage, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> yet many others may bee sowen together
on a plot of ground of that largenesse that may serue euery mans particular vse
as he shall haue occasion to employ it, as Reddish, Lettice and Onions, which after
they are growne vp together may be drawne vp and taken away, as there is occasion to
spend them: but Carrots or Parsneps being sowen with others must bee suffered to
grow last, because they require a longer time before they be fit to be taken vp. Other
herbes require some large compasse of ground whereon they may grow of themselues
without any other herbes growing among them, as Artichokes, Cowcumbers, Melons,
Pompions. And some will doe so with their Cabbages also, but the best and most frugall
way now vsed, is to plant them round about the border of your plot or ground
whereon you plant Cowcumbers, Pompions, or other things, in that by this meanes
so much ground will be well saued, and the other things be no whit hindered thereby,
which else a great deale of ground must be employed for them apart. So that by this
that I haue here said, you may perceiue the forme of this Garden is for the most part,
to bee still out of forme and order, in that the continuall taking vp of the herbes and
rootes that are sowen and planted, causeth the beds or parts of this Garden to lye
broken, dismembered, and out of the order that at the first it was put into. Remember
herewithall that (as I said before) this Garden requireth the continuall helpe of
soyle to be brought into it, in that the plenty of these manner of herbes and rootes
doe so much waste the fertilitie and fatnesse of the ground, that without continuall
refreshing it would quickly become so poore and barren, that it would not yeelde the
worth of the seede. The ordinary time to soyle a Garden, is to bring in manure or
dung before Christmas, and eyther bury at some small depth, not too deepe, or else
to lay it vpon the ground that the winter frostes may pierce it, and then turne it shallow
into the ground to sow your seeds in the Spring.</p>

<i class="sub-title">How to order diuers Garden herbes, both for their sowing,
spending, and gathering of the seede.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">O<span class="looks_big">v</span>r chiefest and greatest Gardiners now adaies, doe so prouide for themselues
euery yeare, that from their owne grounds they gather the seede of many
herbes that they sowe againe: for hauing gained the best kind of diuers herbes,
they will be still furnished with the same, and be not to seeke euery yeare for new that
oftentimes will not yeelde them halfe the profit that their choyce seede will: I say of
many herbes, but not of all; for the best of them all hath not ground sufficient for all
sorts, nor will our climate bring some to that perfection that other forraine doth, and
therefore the seede of some things are continually brought from beyond Sea vnto vs.
And againe although our chiefe Gardiners doe still prouide their owne seede of diuers
things from their owne ground, because as I said it is of the best kinde, yet you must vnderstand
also, that good store of the same sortes of seeds are brought from beyond the
Seas, for that which is gathered in this Land is not sufficient to serue euery mans vse in
the whole Kingdome by many parts; yet still it is true, that our English seede of many
things is better then any that commeth from beyond the Seas: as for example, Reddish,
Lettice, Carrots, Parsneps, Turneps, Cabbages, and Leekes, of all which I intend
to write in this place; for these are by them so husbanded, that they doe not sow
their owne grounds with any other seede of these sorts but their owne: which that
you may know the manner how to doe, I will here set it downe, that euery one may
haue the best directions if they will follow them. Of Reddish there are two sorts, one
more early then the other: they vse therefore to sow their early Reddish first, that they
may haue the earliest profit of them, which is more worth in one fortnight, then in
a moneth after. And to effect this they haue some artificiall helps also; which are these:
They vse to digge vp a large plot of ground where they intend to sow their seede a little
before or after Christmas, casting it into high bankes or ridges fiue or sixe foote asunder,
which they suffer to lye and take all the extreame frosts in Ianuary to mellow
the earth, and when the frostes are past, they then beginne to bring into it good store
of fresh stable dung, which they laye neyther too deepe nor too thicke, and couer it
with the mould a hand breadth thicknesse aboue the dung, which doth giue such a
warmth and comfort to whatsoeuer is sowen thereon, that it forceth it forward much
sooner then any other way can doe: And to preuent both the frostes, and the cold
bitter windes which often spoyle their seede new sprung vp, they vse to set great high
and large mattes made of reedes, tyed together, and fastened vnto strong stakes, thrust
into the ground to keepe them vp from falling, or being blowne down with the winde;
which mattes they place on the North and East side to breake the force of these winds,
and are so sure and safe a defence, that a bricke wall cannot better defend anything
vnder it, then this fence will. In this manner they doe euery yeare to bring forward
their seede to gaine the more by them, and they that will haue Reddish early, must
take the same course. The other sort of Reddish for the most part is sowen in Februarie,
a fortnight after the other at the least, and likewise euery moneth after vnto September,
that they may haue young continually. For the blacke Reddish, although many
in many places doe sowe it in the same time, and in the same manner that the ordinary
is sowen, yet the nature thereof is to runne vp to seede more speedily then the
other, if it haue so rich ground to grow vpon, and therefore the best time to sow it is
in August, that so it may abide all winter, therein is the chiefest time for the spending
thereof, and to keepe it vntill the beginning of the next yeare from running vp to seed:
the gathering whereof, as also of the other sort, is all after one manner, that is, to be
pulled vp when the pods change whitish, and then hanged vpon bushes, pales, or such
other thing, vntill they bee thorough dry, and then beaten or thrashed out vpon a
smooth plancher, or vpon clothes, as euery ones store is, and their conueniencie. Lettice
is sowen oftentimes with the early Reddish, in the same manner before said, that
they may haue Lettice likewise as early as the time of the year will permit them, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
they pull vp where they grow too thicke, spending them first, and so taking vp from
time to time, vntill they stand two foote in sunder one from another, and beginne
to spindle and shoote vp for seede. In this is vsed some arte to make the plants strong
to giue the better seede without danger of rotting or spoyling with the wet, which often
happeneth to those about whom this caution is not obserued: Before your Lettice
is shot vp, marke out the choysest and strongest plantes which are fittest to grow for
seede, and from those when they are a foote high, strippe away with your hand the
leaues that grow lowest vpon the stalke next the ground, which might rot, spoyle or
hinder them from bearing so good seede; which when it is neere to be ripe, the stalkes
must be cut off about the middle, and layde vpon mats or clothes in the Sunne, that it
may there fully ripen and be gathered; for it would be blowne away with the winde
if it should be suffered to abide on the stalkes long. Parsneps must be sowen on a deep
trenched mellow ground, otherwise they may run to seede the first yeare, which then
are nothing worth: or else the rootes will be small staruelings and short, and runne into
many spires or branches, whereby they will not bee of halfe the worth. Some vse
to sow them in August and September, that so they may bee well growne to serue to
spend in Lent following, but their best time is in February, that the Summers growth
may make them the fairer and greater. When they runne vp to seede you shall take
the principall or middle heades, for those carry the Master seede, which is the best, and
will produce the fairest rootes againe. You shall hardly haue all the seede ripe at one
instant, for vsually the chiefest heads will be fallen before the other are ripe: you must
therefore still looke them ouer, and cut them as they ripen. Carrots are vsually sowen
in March and Aprill, and if it chance that some of them doe runne vp for seede the
same year, they are to be weeded out, for neyther the seed nor roots of them are good:
You must likewise pull them vp when they are too thicke, if you will haue them grow
fair, or for seed, that they may grow at the least three or foure foot in sunder: the stalkes
of Carrots are limber, and fall downe to the ground; they must therefore be sustained
by poles layde acrosse on stalkes thrust into the ground, and tyed to the poles and
stalkes to keepe them vp from rotting or spoyling vpon the ground: the seed hereof is
not all ripe at once, but must be tended and gathered as it ripeneth, and layd to dry in
some dry chamber or floore, and then beaten out with a stick, and winnowed from the
refuse. Turneps are sowne by themselues vpon a good ground in the end of Iuly, and
beginning of August, to haue their rootes best to spend in winter; for it often happeneth
that those seedes of Turneps that are sowen in the Spring, runne vp to seede the
same yeare, and then it is not accounted good. Many doe vse to sow Turneps on those
grounds from whence the same yeare they haue taken off Reddish and Lettice, to make
the greater profit of the ground, by hauing two crops of increase in one yeare. The
stalkes of Turneps will bend downe to the ground, as Carrots doe, but yet must not
be bound or ordered in that manner, but suffered to grow without staking or binding,
so as they grow of some good distance in sunder: when the seede beginneth to grow
ripe, be very carefull to preserue it from the birds, which will be most busie to deuour
them. You shall vnderstand likewise that many doe account the best way to haue the
fairest and most principall seede from all these fore-recited herbes, that after they are
sowen and risen to a reasonable growth, they be transplanted into fresh ground. Cabbages
also are not only sowen for the vse of their heads to spend for meat, but to gather
their seede likewise, which howsoeuer some haue endeauoured to doe, yet few
haue gained good seede, because our sharpe hard frostes in winter haue spoyled and
rotted their stockes they preserued for the purpose; but others haue found out a better
and a more sure way, which is, to take vp your stocks that are fittest to be preserued,
and bring them into the house, and there wrap them eyther in clothes, or other things
to defend them from the cold, and hang them vp in a dry place, vntill the beginning of
March following, then planting them in the ground, and a little defend them at the
first with straw cast ouer them from the cold nights, thereby you may be sure to haue
perfect good seede, if your kinde be of the best: Sowe your seed in the moneths of
February or March, and transplant them in May where they may stand to grow for
your vse, but be carefull to kill the wormes or Caterpillers that else will deuoure all
your leaues, and be carefull also that none of the leaues bee broken in the planting, or
otherwise rubbed, for that oftentimes hindereth the well closing of them. Leekes are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
for the most part wholly noursed vp from the seede that is here gathered; and because
there is not so much store of them either sowne or spent, as there is of Onions by the
twentieth part, we are still the more carefull to be prouided from our owne labours;
yet there be diuers Gardiners in this Kingdome, that doe gather some small quantity
of Onion seede also for their owne or their priuate friends spending. The sowing of
them both is much about one time and manner, yet most vsually Leeks are sowne later
then Onions, and both before the end of March at the furthest; yet some sowe Onions
from the end of Iuly to the beginning of September, for their Winter prouision. Those
that are sowne in the Spring, are to be taken vp and transplanted on a fresh bed prepared
for the purpose, or else they will hardly abide a Winter; but hauing taken roote
before Winter, they will beare good seede in the Summer following: You must stake
both your Leekes and your Onion beds, and with poles laid a crosse, binde your lopple
headed stalkes vnto them, on high as well as belowe, or else the winde and their
owne weight will beare them downe to the ground, and spoile your seede. You must
thinne them, that is, pull vp continually after they are first sprung vp those that growe
too thicke, as you doe with all the other herbes before spoken of, that they may haue
the more roome to thriue. Of all these herbes and rootes before spoken of, you must
take the likeliest and fairest to keepe for your seede; for if you should not take the best,
what hope of good seede can you expect? The time for the spending of these herbes
and rootes, not particularly mentioned, is vntill they begin to runne vp for seede, or
vntill they are to be transplanted for seede, or else vntill Winter, while they are good,
as euery one shall see cause.</p>

<i class="sub-title">How to order Artichokes, Melons, Cowcumbers,
and Pompions.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are certaine other herbes to be spoken of, which are wholly noursed vp
for their fruit sake, of whom I shall not need to say much, being they are so
frequent in euery place. Artichokes being planted of faire and large slips, taken
from the roote in September and October (yet not too late) will most of them
beare fruit the next yeare, so that they be planted in well dunged ground, and the earth
raised vp like vnto an Anthill round about each roote, to defend them the better from
the extreame frosts in Winter. Others plant slips in March and Aprill, or sooner, but
although some of them will beare fruit the same yeare, yet all will not. And indeede
many doe rather choose to plant in the spring then in the fall, for that oftentimes an
extreame hard Winter following the new setting of slips, when they haue not taken
sufficient heart and roote in the ground, doth vtterly pierce and perish them, when as
they that are set in the Spring haue the whole Summers growth, to make them strong
before they feele any sharpe frosts, which by that time they are the better able to
beare. Muske Melons haue beene begun to bee noursed vp but of late dayes in this
Land, wherein although many haue tryed and endeauoured to bring them to perfection,
yet few haue attained vnto it: but those rules and orders which the best and skilfullest
haue vsed, I will here set downe, that who so will, may haue as good and ripe
Melons as any other in this Land. The first thing you are to looke vnto, is to prouide
you a peece of ground fit for the purpose, which is either a sloping or sheluing
banke, lying open and opposite to the South Sunne, or some other fit place not sheluing,
and this ground also you must so prepare, that all the art you can vse about it to
make it rich is little enough; and therefore you must raise it with meere stable soyle,
thorough rotten &amp; well turned vp, that it may be at the least three foote deepe thereof,
which you must cast also into high beds or balkes, with deepe trenches or furrowes betweene,
so as the ridges may be at the least a foot and a halfe higher then the furrowes;
for otherwise it is not possible to haue good Melons growe ripe. The choise of your
seede also is another thing of especiall regard, and the best is held to be Spanish, and
not French, which hauing once gained, be sure to haue still of the same while they last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
good, that you may haue the seede of your owne ripe Melons from them that haue
eaten them, or saue some of the best your selfe for the purpose. I say while they last
good; for many are of opinion, that no seede of Muske Melons gathered in England,
will endure good to sowe againe here aboue the third yeare, but still they must be renewed
from whence you had your choisest before. Then hauing prepared a hot bed
of dung in Aprill, set your seedes therein to raise them vp, and couer them, and order
them with as great care or greater then Cowcumbers, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> are vsed, that when they are
ready, they may be transplanted vpon the beds or balkes of that ground you had before
prepared for them, and set them at the least two yards in sunder, euery one as it
were in a hole, with a circle of dung about them, which vpon the setting being watered
with water that hath stood in the Sunne a day or two, and so as often as neede is to
water, couer them with strawe (some vse great hollow glasses like vnto bell heads) or
some such other things, to defend them both from the cold euenings or dayes, and the
heate of the Sunne, while they are young and new planted. There are some that take
vpon them great skill, that mislike of the raising vp of Melons, as they doe also of
Cowcumbers, on a hot bed of horse dung, but will put two or three seedes in a place
in the very ground where they shall stand and growe, and thinke without that former
manner of forcing them forwards, that this their manner of planting will bring them
on fast and sure enough, in that they will plucke away some of the worst and weakest,
if too many rise vp together in a place; but let them know for certaine, that howsoeuer
for Cowcumbers their purpose and order may doe reasonable well, where the ground
is rich and good, and where they striue not to haue them so early, as they that vse the
other way, for Muske Melons, which are a more tender fruit, requiring greater care
and trouble in the noursing, and greater and stronger heate for the ripening, they must
in our cold climate haue all the art vsed vnto them that may be, to bring them on the
more early, and haue the more comfort of the Sunne to ripen them kindly, or else they
will not bee worth the labour and ground. After you haue planted them as aforesaid,
some of good skill doe aduise, that you be carefull in any dry season, to giue them water
twice or thrice euery weeke while they are young, but more afterward when they
are more growne, and that in the morning especially, yea and when the fruit is growne
somewhat great, to water the fruit it selfe with a watering pot in the heate of the day,
is of so good effect, that it ripeneth them much faster, and will giue them the better
taste and smell, as they say. To take likewise the fruit, and gather it at the full time of his
ripenesse is no small art; for if it be gathered before his due time to be presently eaten,
it will be hard and greene, and not eate kindly; and likewise if it be suffered too long,
the whole goodnesse will be lost: You shall therefore know, that it is full time to gather
them to spend presently, when they begin to looke a little yellowish on the outside,
and doe smell full and strong; but if you be to send them farre off, or keepe them
long vpon any occasion, you shall then gather them so much the earlier, that according
to the time of the carriage and spending, they may ripen in the lying, being kept
dry, and couered with woollen clothes: When you cut one to eate, you shall know
it to be ripe and good, if the seede and pulpe about them in the middle be very waterish,
and will easily be separated from the meate, and likewise if the meate looke yellow,
and be mellow, and not hard or greene, and taste full and pleasant, and not waterish:
The vsuall manner to eate them is with pepper and salt, being pared and sliced,
and to drowne them in wine, for feare of doing more harme. Cowcumbers and Pompions,
after they are noursed vp in the bed of hot dung, are to be seuerally transplanted,
each of them on a large plot of ground, a good distance in sunder: but the Pompions
more, because their branches take vp a great deale more ground, &amp; besides, will require
a great deale more watering, because the fruit is greater. And thus haue you the ordering
of those fruits which are of much esteeme, especially the two former, with all the
better sort of persons; and the third kinde is not wholly refused of any, although it
serueth most vsually for the meaner and poorer sort of people, after the first early ripe
are spent.</p>

<i class="sub-title">The ordering of diuers sorts of herbes for the pot, for meate,
and for the table.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">y</span>me, Sauory, and Hyssope, are vsually sowne in the Spring on beds by themselues,
euerie one a part; but they that make a gaine by selling to others the
young rootes, to set the knots or borders of Gardens, doe for the most part
sowe them in Iuly and August, that so being sprung vp before Winter, they will be the
fitter to be taken vp in the Spring following, to serue any mans vse that would haue
them. Sage, Lauender, and Rosemary, are altogether set in the Spring, by slipping
the old stalkes, and taking the youngest and likeliest of them, thrusting them either
twined or otherwise halfe a foote deepe into the ground, and well watered vpon the
setting; if any seasonable weather doe follow, there is no doubt of their well thriuing:
the hot Sunne and piercing drying Windes are the greatest hinderances to them;
and therefore I doe aduise none to set too soone in the Spring, nor yet in Autumne, as
many doe practise: for I could neuer see such come to good, for the extremity of the
Winter comming vpon them so soone after their setting, will not suffer their young
shootes to abide, not hauing taken sufficient strength in the ground, to maintain themselues
against such violence, which doth often pierce the strongest plants. Marierome
and Bassill are sowne in the Spring, yet not too early; for they are tender plants, and
doe not spring vntill the weather bee somewhat warme: but Bassill would bee sowne
dry, and not haue any water of two or three daies after the sowing, else the seede will
turne to a gelly in the ground. Some vse to sowe the seed of Rosemary, but it seldome
abideth the first Winter, because the young plants being small, and not of sufficient
strength, cannot abide the sharpnesse of some Winters, notwithstanding the couering
of them, which killeth many old plants; but the vsuall way is to slippe and set, and so
they thriue well. Many doe vse to sowe all or the most sorts of Pot-herbes together
on one plot of ground, that they neede not to goe farre to gather all the sorts they
would vse. There are many sorts of them well knowne vnto all, yet few or none doe
vse all sorts, but as euery one liketh; some vse those that others refuse, and some esteem
those not to bee wholesome and of a good rellish, which others make no scruple of.
The names of them are as followeth, and a short relation of their sowing or planting.</p>

<p>Rosemary, Tyme, and Sauorie are spoken of before, and Onions, and Leekes.</p>

<p>Mints are to bee set with their rootes in some by-place, for that their rootes doe
creepe so farre vnder ground, that they quickly fill vp the places neare adioyning, if
they be not puld vp.</p>

<p>Clarie is to be sowne, and seedeth and dyeth the next yeare, the herbe is strong, and
therefore a little thereof is sufficient.</p>

<p>Nep is sowne, and dyeth often after seeding, few doe vse it, and that but a little at a
time: both it and Clarie are more vsed in Tansies then in Broths.</p>

<p>Costmarie is to be set of rootes, the leaues are vsed with some in their Broths, but
with more in their Ale.</p>

<p>Pot Marierome is set of rootes, being separated in sunder.</p>

<p>Penniroyall is to be set of the small heads that haue rootes, it creepeth and spreadeth
quickly.</p>

<p>Allisanders are to be sowne of seede, the tops of the rootes with the greene leaues
are vsed in Lent especially.</p>

<p>Parsley is a common herbe, and is sowne of seede, it seedeth the next yeare and
dyeth: the rootes are more vsed in broths then the leaues, and the leaues almost with
all sorts of meates.</p>

<p>Fennell is sowne of seede, and abideth many yeares yeelding seede; the rootes also
are vsed in broths, and the leaues more seldome, yet serue to trimme vp many
fish meates.</p>

<p>Borage is sowne of seede, and dyeth the next yeare after, yet once being suffered to
seede in a Garden, will still come of it owne shedding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>Buglosse commeth of seede, but abideth many yeares after it hath giuen seede, if it
stand not in the coldest place of the Garden.</p>

<p>Marigolds are sowne of seede, and may be after transplanted, they abide two or
three yeares, if they be not set in too cold a place: the leaues and flowers are both vsed.</p>

<p>Langedebeefe is sowne of seede, which shedding it selfe will hardly be destroyed
in a Garden.</p>

<p>Arrach is to be sowne of seede, this likewise will rise euery yeare of it owne seed, if
it be suffered to shed it selfe.</p>

<p>Beetes are sowne of seede, and abideth some yeares after, still giuing seede.</p>

<p>Blites are vsed but in some places, for there is a generall opinion held of them, that
they are naught for the eyes: they are sowne euery yeare of seede.</p>

<p>Bloodwort once sowne abideth many yeares, if the extremity of the frosts kill it
not, and seedeth plentifully.</p>

<p>Patience is of the same nature, and vsed in the same manner.</p>

<p>French Mallowes are to be sowne of seede, and will come of it owne sowing, if it
be suffered to shed it selfe.</p>

<p>Ciues are planted onely by parting the rootes; for it neuer giueth any seede at all.</p>

<p>Garlicke is ordered in the same manner, by parting and planting the rootes euerie
yeare.</p>

<p>These be all the sorts are vsed with vs for that purpose, whereas I said before, none
vseth all, but euery one will vse those they like best: and so much shall suffice for pot-herbes.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak thin" id="Chap_3_VI" title="Chapter 6: Sallets"><span class="main-title"><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span><br></span>

<i class="sub-title">The manner and ordering of many sorts of herbes and
rootes for Sallets.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">I<span class="looks_big">f</span> I should set downe all the sorts of herbes that are vsually gathered for Sallets, I
should not onely speake of Garden herbes, but of many herbes, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> that growe
wilde in the fields, or else be but weedes in a Garden; for the vsuall manner with
many, is to take the young buds and leaues of euery thing almost that groweth, as well
in the Garden as in the Fields, and put them all together, that the taste of the one may
amend the rellish of the other: But I will only shew you those that are sown or planted
in gardens for that purpose. Asparagus is a principall &amp; delectable Sallet herbe, whose
young shootes when they are a good handfull high aboue the ground, are cut an inch
within the ground, which being boyled, are eaten with a little vinegar and butter, as a
Sallet of great delight. Their ordering with the best Gardiners is on this wise: When
you haue prouided seede of the best kinde, you must sowe it either before Christmas,
as most doe, or before the end of February; the later you sowe, the later and the more
hardly will they spring: after they are growne vp, they are to be transplanted in Autumne
on a bed well trenched in with dung; for else they will not bee worth your labour,
and set about a foote distance in sunder, and looke that the more carefull you are
in the replanting of them, the better they will thriue, and the sooner growe great: after
fiue or six yeares standing they vsually doe decay; and therefore they that striue to
haue continually faire and great heads, doe from seede raise vp young for their store.
You must likewise see that you cut not your heads or young shoote too nigh, or too
much, that is, to take away too many heads from a roote, but to leaue a sufficient number
vncut, otherwise it will kill the heart of your rootes the sooner, causing them to
dye, or to giue very small heads or shootes; for you may well consider with your
selfe, that if the roote haue not head enough left it aboue the ground to shoote greene
this yeare, it will not, nor cannot prosper vnder ground to giue encrease the next yeare.
The ordering of Lettice I haue spoken of before, and shall not neede here to repeate
what hath beene already said, but referre you thereunto for the sowing, planting, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
onely I will here shew you the manner of ordering them for Sallets. There are some
sorts of Lettice that growe very great, and close their heads, which are called Cab<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>bage
Lettice, both ordinary and extraordinary, and there are other sorts of great Lettice
that are open, and close not, or cabbage not at all, which yet are of an excellent
kinde, if they be vsed after that especiall manner is fit for them, which is, That when
they are planted (for after they are sowne, they must be transplanted) of a reasonable
distance in sunder, and growne to be of some bignesse, euery one of them must bee
tyed together with bast or thread toward the toppes of the leaues, that by this meanes
all the inner leaues may growe whitish, which then are to be cut vp and vsed: for the
keeping of the leaues close doth make them taste delicately, and to bee very tender.
And these sorts of Lettice for the most part are spent after Summer is past, when other
Lettice are not to be had. Lambes Lettice or Corne Sallet is an herbe, which abiding
all Winter, is the first Sallet herbe of the yeare that is vsed before any ordinarie
Lettice is ready; it is therefore vsually sowne in August, when the seede thereof is
ripe. Purslane is a Summer Sallet herbe, and is to be sowne in the Spring, yet somewhat
late, because it is tender, and ioyeth in warmth; and therefore diuers haue
sowne it vpon those beddes of dung, whereon they noursed vp their Cowcumbers,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> after they are taken away, which being well and often watered, hath yeelded
Sallet vntill the end of the yeare. Spinach is sowne in the Spring, of all for the
most part that vse it, but yet if it be sowne in Summer it will abide greene all the Winter,
and then seedeth quickly: it is a Sallet that hath little or no taste at all therein, like
as Lettice and Purslane, and therefore Cookes know how to make many a good dish
of meate with it, by putting Sugar and Spice thereto. Coleworts are of diuers kinds,
and although some of them are wholly spent among the poorer sort of people, yet
some kindes of them may be dressed and ordered as may delight a curious palate,
which is, that being boyled tender, the middle ribs are taken cold, and laid in dishes,
and vinegar and oyle poured thereon, and so eaten. Coleflowers are to be had in this
Countrey but very seldome, for that it is harde to meete with good seede: it must bee
sowne on beds of dung to force it forward, or else it would perish with the frost before
it had giuen his head of flowers, and transplanted into verie good and rich ground,
lest you lose the benefit of your labours. Endiue is of two sorts, the ordinary, and another
that hath the edges of the leaues curld or crumpled; it is to be whited, to make
it the more dainty Sallet, which is vsually done in this manner: After they are grown
to some reasonable greatnesse (but in any case before they shoote forth a stalke in the
midst for seede) they are to be taken vp, and the rootes being cut away, lay them to
dry or wither for three or foure houres, and then bury them in sand, so as none of
them lye one vpon another, or if you can, one to touch another, which by this meanes
will change whitish, and thereby become verie tender, and is a Sallet both for Autumne
and Winter. Succorie is vsed by some in the same manner, but because it is
more bitter then Endiue, it is not so generally vsed, or rather vsed but of a verie few:
and whereas Endiue will seede the same yeare it is sowne, and then dye, Succorie abideth
manie yeares, the bitternesse thereof causing it to be more Physicall to open obstructions;
and therefore the flowers pickled vp, as diuers other flowers are vsed to be
now adaies, make a delicate Sallet at all times when there is occasion to vse them. Of
red Beetes, the rootes are onely vsed both boyled and eaten cold with vinegar and
oyle, and is also vsed to trimme vp or garnish forth manie sorts of dishes of meate: the
seede of the best kinde will not abide good with vs aboue three yeares, but will degenerate
and growe worse; and therefore those that delight therein must be curious, to
be prouided from beyond Sea, that they may haue such as will giue delight. Sorrell
is an herbe so common, and the vse so well knowne, both for sawce, and to season
broths and meates for the sound as well as sicke persons, that I shall not neede to say
anie more thereof. Cheruill is a Sallet herbe of much vse, both with French and
Dutch, who doe much more delight in herbes of stronger taste then the English doe:
it is sowne early, and vsed but a while, because it quickly runneth vp to seede. Sweete
Cheruill,or as some call it, Sweete Cis, is so like in taste vnto Anise seede, that it
much delighteth the taste among other herbes in a Sallet: the seede is long, thicke,
blacke, and cornered, and must be sowne in the end of Autumne, that it may lye in the
ground all the Winter, and then it will shoote out in the Spring, or else if it be sowne
in the Spring, it will not spring vp that yeare vntill the next: the leaues (as I said before)
are vsed among other herbes: the rootes likewise are not onely cordiall, but
also held to be preseruatiue against the Plague, either greene, dryed, or preserued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
with sugar. Rampion rootes are a kinde of Sallet with a great many, being boyled
tender, and eaten cold with vinegar and pepper. Cresses is an herbe of easie and quick
growth, and while it is young eaten eyther alone, or with parsley and other herbes:
it is of a strong taste to them that are not accustomed thereunto, but it is much vsed of
strangers. Rocket is of the same nature and qualitie, but somewhat stronger in taste:
they are both sowen in the Spring, and rise, seede and dye the same yeare. Tarragon is
an herbe of as strong a taste as eyther Rocket or Cresses, it abideth and dyeth not euery
yeare, nor yet giueth ripe seede (as far as euer could bee found with vs) any yeare,
but maketh sufficient increase within the ground, spreading his roots all abroad a great
way off. Mustard is a common sawce both with fish and flesh, and the seede thereof (and
no part of the plant besides) is well knowne how to be vsed being grownded, as euery
one I thinke knoweth. The rootes of horse Radish likewise beeing grownd like
Mustard, is vsed both of strangers and our owne nation, as sawce for fish. Tansie is of
great vse, almost with all manner of persons in the Spring of the yeare: it is more vsually
planted of the rootes then otherwise; for in that the rootes spread far and neere
they may be easily taken away, without any hurt to the rest of the rootes. Burnet, although
it be more vsed in wine in the Summer time then any way else, yet it is likewise
made a sallet herbe with many, to amend the harm or weak rellish of some other herbs.
Skirrets are better to be sowen of the seed then planted from the roots, and will come
on more speedily, and be fairer rootes: they are as often eaten cold as a Sallet, being
boyled and the pith taken out, as stewed with butter and eaten warme. Let not Parsley
and Fenell be forgotten among your other Sallet herbes, whereof I haue spoken before,
and therefore need say no more of them. The flowers of Marigolds pickt cleane from
the heads, and pickled vp against winter, make an excellent Sallet when no flowers are
to be had in a garden. Cloue Gilloflowers likewise preserued or pickled vp in the same
manner (which is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stratum super stratum</i>, a lay of flowers, and then strawed ouer with fine
dry and poudered Sugar, and so lay after lay strawed ouer, vntill the pot bee full you
meane to keepe them in, and after filled vp or couered ouer with vinegar) make a Sallet
now adayes in the highest esteeme with Gentles and Ladies of the greatest note: the
planting and ordering of them both is spoken of seuerally in their proper places.
Goates bearde that groweth in Gardens only, as well as that which groweth wilde in
Medowes, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> bearing a yellow flower, are vsed as a Sallet, the rootes beeing boyled
and pared are eaten cold with vinegar, oyle and pepper; or else stewed with butter and
eaten warme as Skirrets, Parsneps <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> And thus haue you here set downe all those
most vsuall Sallets are vsed in this Kingdome: I say the most vsuall, or that are noursed
vp in Gardens; for I know there are some other wilde herbes and rootes, as Dandelion
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> but they are vsed onely of strangers, and of those whose curiositie searcheth out
the whole worke of nature to satisfie their desires.</p>

skils, who, to helpe their owne family, and their poore neighbours that are farre
remote from Physitians and Chirurgions, take much paines both to doe good vnto
them, and to plant those herbes that are conducing to their desires. And although
I doe recite some that are mentioned in other places, yet I thought it meete to remember
them altogether in one place. Angelica, the garden kinde, is so good an herbe,
that there is no part thereof but is of much vse, and all cordiall and preseruatiue from
infectious or contagious diseases, whether you will distill the water of the herbe, or
preserue or candie the rootes or the greene stalkes, or vse the seede in pouder or in distillations,
or decoctions with other things: it is sowen of seede, and will abide vntill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
it giue seede, and then dyeth. Rue or Herbe grace is a strong herbe, yet vsed inwardly
against the plague as an Antidote with Figs and Wall-nuts, and helpeth much against
windy bodies: outwardly it is vsed to bee layde to the wrestes of the hands, to driue
away agues: it is more vsually planted of slips then raised from seede, and abideth
long if sharpe frostes kill it not. Dragons being distilled are held to be good to expell
any euill thing from the heart: they are altogether planted of the rootes. Setwall, Valerian,
or Capons tayle, the herbe often, but the roote much better, is vsed to prouoke
sweating, thereby to expell euill vapours that might annoy the heart: it is only planted
of the rootes when they are taken vp, and the young replanted. Asarabacca, the
leaues are often vsed to procure vomiting being stamped, and the strained iuice to a little
quantitie, put into a draught of ale and drunke, thereby to ease the stomacke of
many euill and grosse humours that there lye and offend it; diuers also take the leaues
and rootes a little boyled in wine, with a little spice added thereunto, to expell both
tertian and quartan agues: the rootes of our English growing is more auaileable for
these purposes then any outlandish: it is planted by the roote; for I could neuer see
it spring of seede. Masterwort commeth somewhat neere in propertie vnto Angelica,
and besides very effectuall to disperse winde in the bodie, whether of the colicke or
otherwise; as also very profitable to comfort in all cold causes: it yeeldeth seede, but
yet is more vsually planted from the rootes being parted. Balme is a cordiall herbe
both in smell and taste, and is wholly vsed for those purposes, that is, to comfort
the heart being distilled into water either simple or compound, or the herbe dryed and
vsed: it is set of the rootes being parted, because it giueth no seede that euer I could
obserue. Camomill is a common herbe well knowne, and is planted of the rootes in
alleyes, in walkes, and on bankes to sit on, for that the more it is troden on, and pressed
downe in dry weather, the closer it groweth, and the better it will thriue: the vse
thereof is very much, both to warme and comfort, and to ease paines being applyed
outwardly after many fashions: the decoction also of the flowers prouoketh sweat,
and they are much vsed against agues. Featherfew is an herbe of greater vse for women
then for men, to dissolue flatulent or windy humours, which causeth the paines of
the mother: some vse to take the iuice thereof in drinke for agues: it is as well sowen
of the seede as planted of the rootes. Costmary is vsed among those herbes that are
put into ale to cause it haue a good rellish, and to be somewhat physicall in the moneth
of May, and doth helpe to prouoke vrine: it is set of the rootes being parted. Maudlin
is held to be a principall good herbe to open and cleanse the liuer, and for that purpose
is vsed many wayes, as in ale, in tansies, and in broths <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> the seed also is vsed, and so is
the herbe also sometimes, to kill the wormes in children: it is sowen of the seede, and
planted also of the separated rootes. Cassidonie is a small kinde of Lauender, but differing
both in forme and qualitie: it is much vsed for the head to ease paines thereof,
as also put among other things to purge melancholicke diseases: it is sowen of seede,
and abideth not a winter vnlesse it bee well defended, and yet hardly giueth ripe seede
againe with vs. Smallage is a great opening herbe, and much more then eyther Parsley
or Fenell, and the rootes of them all are often vsed together in medicines: it is sowen
of seede, and will not bee wanting in a Garden if once you suffer it to sow it selfe.
Cardus Benedictus, or the Blessed Thistle, is much vsed in the time of any infection or
plague, as also to expell any euill symptome from the heart at all other times. It is vsed
likewise to be boyled in posset drink, &amp; giuen to them that haue an ague, to help to cure
it by sweating or otherwise. It is vsually sowen of seed, and dyeth when it hath giuen
seed. Winter Cherries are likewise nursed vp in diuers gardens, for that their propertie is
to giue helpe to them that are troubled eyther with the stopping or heate or their vrine:
the herbe and berries are often distilled, but the berries alone are more often vsed:
after it is once planted in a garden it will runne vnder ground, &amp; abide well enough.
Celondine is held to bee good for the iaundise, it is much vsed for to cleere dim eyes,
eyther the iuice or the water dropped into them: it is sowen of seede, and being once
brought into a garden, will hardly be weeded out; the seede that sheddeth will so sow
it selfe, and therefore some corner in a garden is the fittest place for it. Tabacco is of
two sorts, and both vsed to be planted in Gardens, yet the English kinde (as it is called)
is more to be found in our Countrey Gardens then the Indian sort: the leaues of both
sorts indifferently, that is, of eyther of which is next at hand, being stamped and boy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>led
eyther by it selfe, or with other herbes in oyle or hogs suet, doe make an excellent
salue for greene wounds, and also to clense old vlcers or sores; the iuice of the greene
leaues drunke in ale, or a dryed leafe steeped in wine or ale for a night, and the wine or
ale drunke in the morning, prouoketh to cast, but the dryed leafe much stronger then
the greene: they are sowen of seede, but the Indian kinde is more tender, and will not
abide a winter with vs abroade. Spurge that vsually groweth in Gardens, is a violent
purger, and therefore it is needfull to be very carefull how it is vsed: the seede is more
ordinarily vsed then any other part of the plant, which purgeth by vomiting in some,
and both vpwards and downwards in many; the iuice of the herbe, but especially the
milke thereof, is vsed to kill wartes: it is sowen of seede, and when it doth once shed
it selfe, it will still continue springing of the fallen seede. Bearefoote is sowen of seed,
and will hardly abide transplanting vnlesse it bee while it is young; yet abideth diuers
yeares, if it stand not in too cold a place. This I speake of the greater kinde; for the
lower small wilde kinde (which is the most ordinary in this land) will neuer decay: the
leaues are sometimes vsed greene, but most vsually dryed and poudered, and giuen in
drinke to them that haue the wormes: it purgeth melancholy, but especially the roots.
In many Countries of this Land, and elsewhere, they vse to thrust the stalk of the great
kinde through the eare or dewlap of Kine and Cattell, to cure them of many diseases.
Salomons Seale, or (as some call it) Ladder to heauen, although it doth grow wilde in
many places of this Land, yet is planted in Gardens: it is accounted an excellent
wound herbe to consolidate, and binde, insomuch that many vse it with good successe
to cure ruptures, and to slay both the white and the red fluxe in women: it is planted
altogether of the rootes, for I could neuer finde it spring from the seede, it is so strong.
Comfry likewise is found growing wilde in many places by ditch sides, and in moist
places, and therefore requireth some moist places of the garden: it is wholly vsed for
knitting, binding, and consolidating fluxes and wounds, to be applyed either inwardly
or outwardly: The rootes are stronger for those purposes then any other parts of the
plant. Licoris is much vsed now adaies to bee planted in great quantitie, euen to fill
many acres of ground, whereof riseth a great deale of profit to those that know how
to order it, and haue fit grounds for it to thriue in; for euery ground will not be aduantagious:
It will require a very rich, deepe and mellow ground, eyther naturall or artificiall;
but for a priuate house where a small quantitie will serue, there needeth not so
much curiositie: it is vsually planted of the top heads, when the lower rootes (which
are the Licoris that is vsed) and the runners are cut from them. Some vse to make an ordinary
drinke or beuerage of Licoris, boyled in water as our vsuall ale or beere is with
malt, which fermented with barme in the same manner, and tunned vp, serueth in stead
thereof, as I am credibly informed: It is otherwise in a manner wholly spent for colds,
coughes and rheumes, to expectorate flegme, but vsed in diuers formes, as in iuice, in
decoctions, syrrups, roules, trochisces, and the greene or dryed roote of it selfe.</p>

<p>And these are the most ordinary Physicall herbes that are vsed to be planted in gardens
for the vse of any Country familie, that is (as I said before) farre remote from
Physitians or Chirurgions abidings, that they may vse as occasion serueth for themselues
or their neighbours, and by a little care and paines in the applying may doe a
great deale of good, and sometimes to them that haue not wherewith to spend on
themselues, much lesse on Physitians or Chirurgions, or if they haue, may oftentimes
receiue lesse good at their hands then at others that are taught by experience in their
owne families, to be the more able to giue helpe to others.</p>

are vsually planted in Gardens, to serue for the vse of the Table
whether of the poore or rich of our Countrey: but herein I intend
not to bring any fruite bearing trees, shrubbes, or bushes;
for I reserue them for my Orchard, wherin they shal be set forth.
So that in these three parts, I suppose the exquisite ornament of
any worthy house is consummate for the exteriour bounds, the
benefit of their riches extending also to the furnishing of the
most worthy inward parts thereof: but because many take pleasure
in the sight and knowledge of other herbes that are Physicall, and much more in
their properties and vertues, if vnto these three I should adde a Physicke Garden, or
Garden of Simples, there would be a quadripartite complement, of whatsoeuer arte
or nature, necessitie or delight could affect: which to effect (as many my friends haue,
intreated it at my hands) will require more paines and time then all this worke together:
yet to satisfie their desires and all others herein, that would bee enformed in the
truth, and reformed of the many errours and slips set forth and published heretofore
of plants by diuers, I shall (God assisting and granting life) labour to performe, that it
may shew it selfe to the light in due conueniencie, if these bee well and gratefully accepted.
And because I ended with some sweete herbes in the former part, I will in this
part beginne with the rest, which I reserued for this place, as fitter for the pot and
kitchen then for the hand or bosome, and so descend to other herbes that are for meat
or sallets: and after them to those rootes that are to be eaten, as meate or as sallets:
and lastly the fruits that grow neere, or vpon the ground, or not much aboue it; as the
Artichoke, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> in which I make a shorter description then I did in the former, rather
endeauouring to shew what they are, and whereunto they are vsed, then the whole
varietie or any exact declaration: which methode, although in some sort it may bee
fitting for this purpose, yet it is not for an history or herball: I shall therefore require
their good acceptance for whose sake I doe it, not doubting, but that I, or others, if
they write againe of this subiect, may polish and amende what formerly hath beene
eyther mis set, or not so thoroughly expressed, besides some additions of new conceits;
seeing I treade out a new path, and therefore those that follow may the easilier see the
Meanders, and so goe on in a direct line.</p>

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are two sorts of Sauory, the one called Summer, and the other Winter
Sauorie: The Summer Sauory is a small tender herbe, growing not aboue
a foote and a halfe high, or thereabouts, rising vp with diuers brittle branches,
slenderly or sparsedly set with small long leaues, soft in handling, at euery ioynt a couple,
one against another, of a pleasant strong and quicke sent and taste: the flowers are
small and purplish, growing at the toppes of the stalkes, with two small long leaues at
the ioynts vnder them: the seede is small, and of a darke colour, bigger then Tyme
seede by the halfe: the roote is wooddy, and hath many strings, perishing euery
yeare wholly, and must bee new sowen againe, if any will haue it.</p>

<p>The Winter Sauorie is a small low bushie herbe, very like vnto Hyssope, but not aboue
a foote high, with diuers small hard branches, and hard darke green leaues thereon,
thicker set together then the former by much, and as thicke as common Hyssope,
sometimes with foure leaues or more at a ioynt, of a reasonable strong sent, yet not so
strong or quicke as the former: the flowers are of a pale purplish colour, set at seuerall
distances at the toppes of the stalkes, with leaues at the ioynts also with them, like the
former: the roote is woody, with diuers small strings thereat, and abideth all the
winter with his greene leaues: it is more vsually encreased by slipping or diuiding the
roote, and new setting it seuerally againe in the Spring, then by sowing the seed.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Sauorie.</h4>

<p>The Summer Sauorie is vsed in other Countryes much more then with vs
in their ordinary diets, as condiment or sawce to their meates, sometimes of
it selfe, and sometimes with other herbes, and sometimes strewed or layde
vpon the dishes as we doe Parsley, as also with beanes and pease, rise and
wheate; and sometimes the dryed herbe boyled among pease to make
pottage.</p>

<p>The Winter Sauorie is one of the (farsing) faseting herbes as they call
them, and so is the Summer Sauorie also sometimes. This is vsed also in the
same manner that the Summer Sauorie is, set downe before, and to the same
purposes: as also to put into puddings, sawsages, and such like kindes of
meates. Some doe vse the pouder of the herbe dryed (as I sayd before of
Tyme) to mixe with grated bread, to breade their meate, be it fish or flesh, to
giue it the quicker rellish. They are both effectuall to expell winde.</p>

but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">actum agere</i>, to bestow any time thereon, being a small bushie plant, not rising
aboue two foote high, with many branches, woody below, and tender
aboue, whereon are set at certaine distances, sundry small, long and narrow greene
leaues: at the toppe of euery stalke stand blewish purple gaping flowers, one aboue
another in a long spike or eare: after which followeth the seede, which is small and
blackish: the rootes are composed of many threddy strings; the whole plant is of a
strong sweet sent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Hyssope.</h4>

<p>Hyssope is much vsed in Ptisans and other drinkes, to help to expectorate
flegme. It is many Countrey peoples medicine for a cut or greene wound,
being bruised with sugar and applyed. I finde it is also much commended
against the falling sickenesse, especially being made into pils after the manner
before rehearsed. It is accounted a speciall remedy against the sting or
biting of an Adder, if the place be rubbed with Hyssope, bruised and mixed
with honey, salt and cummin seede. A decoction thereof with oyle, and
annointed, taketh away the itching and tingling of the head, and vermine
also breeding therein. An oyle made of the herbe and flowers, being annointed,
doth comfort benummed sinewes and ioynts.</p>

time in the description of it: hauing many weake round stalkes, diuided into
sundry branches, rather leaning or lying vpon the ground then standing vpright,
whereon are set at seuerall ioynts, small roundish darke greene leaues: the flowers are
purplish that grow in gardens, yet some that grow wilde are white, or more white then
purple, set in roundles about the tops of the branches; the stalkes shoote forth small
fibres or rootes at the ioynts, as it lyeth vpon the ground, thereby fastening it selfe
therein, and quickly increaseth, and ouer-runneth any ground, especially in the shade
or any moist place, and is replanted by breaking the sprouted stalkes, and so quickely
groweth.</p>

<p>Other sorts of Pennyroyall are fit for the Physicke Garden, or Garden of Simples.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Pennyroyall.</h4>

<p>It is very good and wholesome for the lunges, to expell cold thin flegme,
and afterwards to warme and dry it vp: and is also of the like propertie as
Mintes, to comfort the stomacke, and stay vomiting. It is also vsed in womens
baths and washings: and in mens also to comfort the sinewes. It is yet
to this day, as it hath beene in former times, vsed to bee put into puddings,
and such like meates of all sorts, and therefore in diuers places they know
it by no other name then Pudding-grasse.</p>

<p>The former age of our great Grandfathers, had all these hot herbes in
much and familiar vse, both for their meates and medicines, and therewith
preserued themselues in long life and much health: but this delicate age of
ours, which is not pleased with any thing almost, be it meat or medicine, that
is not pleasant to the palate, doth wholly refuse these almost, and therefore
cannot be partaker of the benefit or them.</p>

<p>There are two especiall kindes of Sage noursed vp in our Gardens, for our ordinary
vse, whereof I intend to write in this place, leauing the rest to his fitter
place. Our ordinary Sage is reckoned to bee of two sorts, white and red,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
both of them bearing many foure square wooddy stalkes, in some whiter, in others
redder, as the leaues are also, standing by couples at the ioynts, being long, rough, and
wrinkled, of a strong sweete sent: at the tops of the stalkes come forth the flowers, set

<p>It is also much vsed among other good herbes to bee tund vp with Ale,
which thereupon is termed Sage Ale, whereof many barrels full are made,
and drunke in the said moneth chiefly for the purpose afore recited: and also
for teeming women, to helpe them the better forward in their childebearing,
if there be feare of abortion or miscarrying.</p>

<p>It is also vsed to be boyled among other herbes, to make Gargles or waters
to wash sore mouths and throates: As also among other herbes, that
serue as bathings, to wash mens legs or bodies in the Summer time, to comfort
nature, and warme and strengthen aged cold sinewes, and lengthen the
strength of the younger.</p>

<p>The Kitchen vse is either to boyle it with a Calues head, and being minced,
to be put with the braines, vinegar and pepper, to serue as an ordinary
sawce thereunto: Or being beaten and iuyced (rather then minced as mannie
doe) is put to a rosted Pigges braines, with Currans for sawce thereunto.
It is in small quantity (in regard of the strong taste thereof) put among
other fasting herbes, to serue as sawce for peeces of Veale, when they
are farsed or stuffed therewith, and rosted, which they call Olliues.</p>

<p>For all the purposes aforesaid, the small Sage is accounted to be of the
more force and vertue.</p>

properties of the true naturall Baulme, and finding this herbe to be so
effectuall, gaue it the name of Baulme, in imitation of his properties and

<abbr title="which">wᶜʰ</abbr> by proof I haue found to be so like vnto the true Rubarbe, or the Rha of Pontus,
both for forme and colour, that I dare say it is the very true Rubarbe, our climate
only making it lesse strong in working, lesse heauy, and lesse bitter in taste: For this hath
great and thicke rootes, as diuersly discoloured with flesh coloured veines as the true
Rubarbe, as I haue to shew to any that are desirous to see and know it; and also other
smaller sprayes or branches of rootes, spreading from the maine great roote, which
smaller branches may well be compared to the <i>Rhaponticum</i> which the Merchants haue
brought vs, which we haue seene to be longer and slenderer then Rubarbe, but of the
very same colour: this beareth so goodly large leaues, that it is a great beauty in a garden
to behold them: for I haue measured the stalke of the leafe at the bottome next
the roote to bee of the bignesse of any mans thumbe; and from the roote to the leafe
it selfe, to bee two foote in length, and sometimes more; and likewise the leafe it selfe,
from the lower end where it is ioyned to the stalke, to the end or point thereof, to bee
also two foote in length, and sometimes more; and also in the broadest part of the
leafe, to be two foote or more ouer in breadth: it beareth whitish flowers, contrary to
all other Dockes, and three square brownish seede as other Dockes doe, but bigger,
and therefore assuredly it is a Docke, and the true Rubarbe of the Arabians, or at the
least the true <i>Rhaponticum</i> of the Ancients. The figure of the whole plant I haue caused
to be cut, with a dryed roote as it grew in my garden by it selfe, and haue inserted
it here, both because Matthiolus giueth a false figure of the true Rubarbe, and that this
hath not been expressed and set forth by any before.</p>

seldome to any other purpose: the roote is often vsed in Diet-beere, or ale,
or in other drinkes made by decoction, to helpe to purge the liuer, and
clense the blood. The other Rubarbe or <i>Rhaponticum</i>, whereof I make mention,
and giue you here the figure, I haue tryed, and found by experience to
purge gently, without that astriction that is in the true Rubarbe is
brought vs from the East Indies, or China, and is also lesse bitter in taste;
whereby I coniecture it may bee vsed in hot and feauerish bodies more effectually,
because it doth not binde after the purging, as the East India Rubarbe
doth: but this must bee giuen in double quantitie to the other, and
then no doubt it will doe as well: The leaues haue a fine acide taste: A syrrupe
therefore made with the iuice and sugar, cannot but be very effectuall
in deiected appetites, and hot fits of agues; as also to helpe to open obstructions
of the liuer, as diuers haue often tryed, and found auaileable by experience.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">S<span class="looks_big">o</span>rrell must needes bee reckoned with the Dockes, for that it is so like vnto them
in all things, and is of many called the sower Docke. Of Sorrels there are many
sorts, but I shall not trouble you with any other in this place, then the common
Garden Sorrell, which is most knowne, and of greatest vse with vs; which hath
tender greene long leaues full of iuice, broade, and bicorned as it were, next vnto the
stalke, like as Arrach, Spinach, and our English Mercurie haue, of a sharpe sower taste:
the stalkes are slender, bearing purplish long heads, wherein lye three square shining
browne seede, like, but lesser then the other: the root is smaller then any of the other
Dockes, but browne, and full of strings, and abideth without decaying, hauing greene
leaues all the winter, except in the very extremitie thereof, which often taketh away
all or most of his leaues.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Sorrell.</h4>

<p>Sorrell is much vsed in sawces, both for the whole, and the sicke, cooling
the hot liuers, and stomackes of the sicke, and procuring vnto them an
appetite vnto meate, when their spirits are almost spent with the violence of
their furious or fierie fits; and is also of a pleasant relish for the whole, in
quickning vp a dull stomacke that is ouer-loaden with euery daies plenty of
dishes. It is diuers waies dressed by Cooks, to please their Masters stomacks.</p>

in any part, sauing only a little in the leafe; &amp; our Borage or Buglosse might more
fitly, according to the Greeke name, bee called Oxe tongue or Langdebeefe; and this

whereunto it neerest approacheth: but as it is commonly receiued, so take it in this

vp a round greene hairy or prickly stalk, bearing at the toppe, among a few small green
leaues, diuers small yellow flowers in rough heads, which turne into doune, containing
within them browne yellowish small long seedes, somewhat like vnto the seede of
Hawkeweede: the roote is wooddy, which perisheth quickly after it hath borne seed;
but is tender while it is young.</p>

Fieldes, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and others of the Sea, which are not to bee spoken of in this
worke, but referred to a generall historie. The white garden Arrach, or Orach, hath
diuers leaues, standing vpon their seuerall footestalkes, broade at the bottome, ending
in two points like an arrow, with two feathers at the head, and small pointed at the
end of the leafe, of a whitish yellow greene colour, and as it were strewed ouer with
flower or meale, especially while they are young: the stalke like wise is mealy, bearing
many branches with small yellow flowers on them, which turne into small leafie seeds:
the roote groweth somewhat deepe in the ground, with many small threds fastened
thereto: it quickly springeth vp of the seede, groweth great, and fadeth away as soon
as it hath borne seede.</p>

<p>The purple Arrach is in all things like vnto the white, sauing onely in the colour of

are noursed vp in Gardens, I will set forth in this place, which are onely two,
that haue come to my knowledge, that is, the white and the red, and are of a qualitie
as neere vnto Arrach as vnto Beetes, participating of both, and therefore I haue placed
them betwixt them. The white Blite hath leaues somewhat like vnto Beetes, but
smaller, rounder, and of a whitish greene colour, euery one standing vpon a small long
footestalke: the stalke riseth vp two or three foote high, with many such like leaues

<p>Blites are vsed as Arrach, eyther boyled of it selfe or stewed, which they

doe vtterly refuse it, because in diuers it prouoketh castings. It is altogether
insipide or without taste, but yet by reason of the moist slipperie qualitie
it hath, it helpeth to loosen the belly. The vnsauorinesse whereof hath

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are many diuersities of Beetes, some growing naturally in our own Country,
others brought from beyond Sea; whereof some are white, some greene,
some yellow, some red: the leaues of some are of vse only, and the root not
vsed: others the roote is only vsed, and not the leaues: and some againe, both roote
and leafe. The ancient Authors, as by their workes appeare, knew but two sorts, the
white and the blacke Beete, whereof the white is sufficiently known, and was of them
termed <i>Sicula</i>, of the later Physitians, <i>Sicla</i>, because it was thought first to be brought
from Sicilie: the blacke abideth some controuersie; some thinking that our common
greene Beete, because it is of a darke greene colour, was that they called the blacke
Beete; others that our small red Beete, which is of a darke red colour, was their black
Beete, which in my opinion is the more likely: But to come to the matter in hand, and
giue you the descriptions of them which are in vse with vs, and leaue controuersies to
such a worke as is fit for them, wherein all such matters may be discussed at large.</p>

<p>The common white Beete hath many great leaues next the ground (in some hot
Countries growing to be three foote long, and very broade, in our Countrey they are
very large, but nothing neere that proportion) of a whitish greene colour; the stalke
is great, strong, and ribbed or crested, bearing great store of leaues vpon it vp to the
very toppe almost: the flowers grow in very long tufts, small at the ends, and turning
down their heads, which are small pale greenish yellow burres, giuing cornered prickly
seede: the roote is great, long and hard, when it hath giuen seede, of no vse at all,
but abideth a former winter with his leaues vpon it, as all other sorts following doe.</p>

<p>The common red Beet differeth not from the white Beete, but only that it is not so
great, and both the leaues and rootes are somewhat red: the leaues bee in some more
red then in others, which haue but red veines or strakes in them, in some also of a fresh
red, in others very darke red: the roote hereof is red, spongy, and not vsed to bee
eaten.</p>

<p>The common greene Beete is also like vnto the white Beete, but of a darke greene
colour. This hath beene found neere the salt Marshes by Rochester, in the foote-way
going from the Lady Levesons house thither, by a worthy, diligent and painefull obseruer
and preseruer both of plants and all other natures varieties, often remembred
before in this worke, called Iohn Tradescante, who there finding it, gaue me the knowledge
thereof, and I haue vpon his report set it here down in this manner:</p>

<p>The Romane red Beete, called <i>Beta raposa</i>, is both for leafe and roote the most excellent
Beete of all others: his rootes bee as great as the greatest Carrot, exceeding red
both within and without, very sweete and good, fit to bee eaten: this Beete groweth
higher then the last red Beete, whose rootes are not vsed to bee eaten: the leaues like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>wise
are better of taste, and of as red a colour as the former red Beete: the roote is
sometimes short like a Turnep, whereof it took the name of <i>Rapa</i> or <i>raposa</i>; and sometimes
as I said before, like a Carrot and long: the seede is all one with the lesser red Beete.</p>

<p>The Italian Beete is of much respect, whose faire greene leaues are very large and
great, with great white ribbes and veines therein: the stalke in the Summer time, when
it is growen vp to any height, is six square in shew, and yellowish withall, as the heades
with seede vpon them seeme likewise.</p>

<p>The great red Beete that Master Lete a Merchant of London gaue vnto Master Gerrard,
as he setteth it downe in his <cite>Herball</cite>, seemeth to bee the red kinde of the last remembred
Beete, whose great ribbes as he saith, are as great as the middle ribbe of the
Cabbage leafe, and as good to bee eaten, whose stalke rose with him to the height of
eight cubits, and bore plenty of seede.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Beetes.</h4>

<p>Beetes, both white, greene and red, are put into the pot among other
herbes, to make pottage, as is commonly known vnto all, and are also boyled
whole, both in France vsually with most of their boyled meates, and in
our Countrey, with diuers that delight in eating of herbes.</p>

<p>The Italian Beete, and so likewise the last red Beete with great ribbes, are
boyled, and the ribbes eaten in sallets with oyle, vinegar and pepper, and is
accounted a rare kinde of sallet, and very delicate.</p>

<p>The roote of the common red Beete with some, but more especially the
Romane red Beete, is of much vse among Cookes to trimme or set out their
dishes of meate, being cut out into diuers formes and fashions, and is grown
of late dayes into a great custome of seruice, both for fish and flesh.</p>

<p>The rootes of the Romane red Beete being boyled, are eaten of diuers
while they are hot with a little oyle and vinegar, and is accounted a delicate
sallet for the winter; and being cold they are so vsed and eaten likewise.</p>

<p>The leaues are much vsed to mollifie and open the belly, being vsed in the
decoction of Glisters. The roote of the white kinde scraped, and made vp
with a little honey and salt, rubbed on and layd on the belly, prouoketh to
the stoole. The vse of eating Beetes is likewise held to bee helpefull to
spleneticke persons.</p>

more cut in about the edges: the stalkes are round and great, two foote high or better,
bearing diuers leaues on them, and at the toppe spokie roundles of white flowers

<p>The tops of the rootes, with the lower part of the stalkes of Alisanders,
are vsed in Lent especially, and Spring of the yeare, to make broth, which

many, by reason of the aromaticall or spicie taste, warming and comforting
the stomack, and helping it digest the many waterish and flegmaticke
meates are in those times much eaten. The rootes also either rawe or boyled
are often eaten with oyle and vinegar. The seede is more vsed physically
then the roote, or any other part, and is effectuall to prouoke plenty of vrine
in them that pisse by drops, or haue the Strangury: It helpeth womens
courses, and warmeth their benummed bodies or members, that haue
endured fierce cold daies and nights, being boyled and drunke.</p>

Fennell (that hath his sweetnesse from his naturall soyle and clymate; for howsoeuer
it bee reasonable sweete the first yeare it is sowne with vs, yet it quickly doth

The first yeare it is sowne and planted with vs (and the first that euer I saw, was in a

so sweete and pleasant, especially while it is young, as if Sugar had beene mingled

and so likewise much more the next yeare; that it groweth from the seed was
gathered here: the leaues are many, spreading farre about the roote, broader and of a
fresher greene colour then our ordinary Smalladge, and vpon longer stalkes: the seed
is as plentifull as Parsley, being small and very like vnto it, but darker of colour.</p>

<p>The Venetians vse to prepare it for meate many waies, both the herbe

<p class="noindent cap">W<span class="looks_big">e</span> haue three sorts of Parsley in our Gardens, and but one of Smalladge:
Our common Parsley, Curld Parsley, and Virginia Parsley; which last,
although it be but of late knowne, yet it is now almost growne common,
and of as good vse as the other with diuers. Our common Parsley is so well knowne,
that it is almost needlesse to describe it, hauing diuers fresh greene leaues, three alwaies
placed together on a stalke, and snipt about the edges, and three stalkes of leaues for
the most part growing together: the stalkes growe three or foure foote high or better,
bearing spikie heads of white flowers, which turne into small seede, somewhat sharpe
and hot in taste: the roote is long and white.</p>

<p>Curld Parsley hath his leaues curled or crumpled on the edges, and therein is the
onely difference from the former.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<p>Virginia Parley is in his leafe altogether like vnto common Parsley for the forme,
consisting of three leaues set together, but that the leaues are as large as Smallage
leaues, but of a pale or whitish greene colour, and of the same taste of our common
Parsley: the seede hereof is as the leaues, twice if not thrice as bigge as the ordinary
Parsley, and perisheth when it hath giuen seede, abiding vsually the first yeare of the
sowing.</p>

<p>Smallage is in forme somewhat like vnto Parsley, but greater and greener, and lesse
pleasant, or rather more bitter in taste: the seede is smaller, and the root more stringy.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Parsley.</h4>

<p>Parsley is much vsed in all sorts of meates, both boyled, roasted,
stewed, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and being greene it serueth to lay vpon sundry meates, as
also to draw meate withall. It is also shred and stopped into poudered
beefe, as also into legges of Mutton, with a little beefe suet among it, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>The rootes are often vsed to be put into broth, to helpe to open obstructions
of the liuer, reines, and other parts, helping much to procure vrine.</p>

<p>The rootes likewise boyled or stewed with a legge of Mutton, stopped
with Parsley as aforesaid, is very good meate, and of very good rellish, as I
haue proued by the taste; but the rootes must bee young, and of the first
yeares growth, and they will haue their operation to cause vrine.</p>

<p>The seed also is vsed for the same cause, when any are troubled with the
stone, or grauell, to open the passages of vrine.</p>

<p>Although Smallage groweth in many places wilde in moist grounds, yet
it is also much planted in Gardens, and although his euill taste and sauour
doth cause it not to be accepted into meates as Parsley, yet it is not without
many speciall good properties, both for outward and inward diseases, to
helpe to open obstructions, and prouoke vrine. The iuyce cleanseth vlcers;
and the leaues boyled with Hogs grease, healeth felons on the ioynts of the
fingers.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are three sorts of Fenell, whereof two are sweete. The one of them is
the ordinary sweete Fenell, whose seedes are larger and yellower then the
common, and which (as I said before in the <a href="#Chap_4_XXII" title="go to Kitchen Garden Chapter 22">Chapter of sweete Parsley</a>) doth
soone degenerate in this our Country into the common. The other sweete Fenell is
not much knowne, and called Cardus Fenell by those that sent it out of Italy, whose
leaues are more thicke and bushie then any of the other. Our common Fenell, whereof
there is greene and red, hath many faire and large spread leaues, finely cut and diuided
into many small, long, greene, or reddish leaues, yet the thicker tufted the branches
be, the shorter are the leaues: the stalkes are round, with diuers ioynts and leaues at
them, growing fiue or six foot high, bearing at the top many spoakie rundels of yellow
flowers; the Common, I meane, doth turne into a darke grayish flat seede, and the
Sweete into larger and yellower: the roote is great, long, and white, and endureth
diuers yeares.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Fenell.</h4>

<p>Fenell is of great vse to trimme vp, and strowe vpon fish, as also to boyle
or put among fish of diuers sorts, Cowcumbers pickled, and other fruits, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
The rootes are vsed with Parsley rootes, to be boyled in broths and drinkes
to open obstructions. The seed is of much vse with other things to expell
winde. The seede also is much vsed to be put into Pippin pies, and diuers
other such baked fruits, as also into bread, to giue it the better rellish.
The sweete Cardus Fenell being sent by Sir Henry Wotton to Iohn
Tradescante, had likewise a large direction with it how to dresse it; for they
vse to white it after it hath been transplanted for their vses, which by reason
of the sweetnesse by nature, and the tendernesse by art, causeth it to be the
more delightfull to the taste, especially with them that are accustomed to
feede on greene herbes.</p>

resembling the leaues of Hemlockes, but of so pleasant a taste, that one would verily

and oyle, to comfort the cold stomacke of the aged. The roots are vsed by
diuers, being boyled, and after eaten with oyle and vinegar, as an excellent

<p class="noindent cap">S<span class="looks_big">p</span>inach or Spinage is of three sorts (yet some doe reckon of foure, accounting
that herbe that beareth no seede to be a sort of it selfe, when it is but an accident
of nature, as it falleth out in Hempe, Mercury, and diuers other herbes) two that
bear prickly seed, the one much greater then the other: the third that beareth a smooth
seede, which is more daintie, and noursed vp but in few Gardens: The common Spinach
which is the lesser of the two prickly sorts, hath long greene leaues, broad at the
stalke, and rent, or torne as it were into foure corners, and sharpe pointed at the ends:
it quickly runneth vp to stalke, if it be sowen in the Spring time; but else, if at the end
of Summer, it will abide all the winter green, and then suddenly in the very beginning
of the Spring, runne vp to stalke, bearing many leaues both below and at the toppe,
where there doth appeare many smal greenish flowers in clusters, and after them prickly
seede: The other greater sort that hath prickly seede, is in all things like the former
but larger both in stalke, leafe and seede. The smooth Spinach hath broader, and
a little rounder pointed leaues then the first, especially the lower leaues; for those that
grow vpwards vpon the stalke, are more pointed, and as it were three square, of as
darke a greene colour as the former: at the seuerall ioynts of the stalkes and branches,
stand clustering many small greenish flowers, which turne into clusters of round whitish
seede, without any prickles at all vpon them: the roote is long, white and small,
like vnto the other, with many fibres at it: If it be often cut, it will grow the thicker,
or else spindle vp very thinly, and with but few leaues vpon the stalke.</p>

<p>Spinage is an herbe fit for sallets, and for diuers other purposes for the
table only; for it is not knowne to bee vsed physically at all. Many English
that haue learned it of the Dutch people, doe stew the herbe in a pot or
pipkin, without any other moisture then it owne, and after the moisture is a
little pressed from it, they put butter, and a little spice vnto it, and make
therewith a dish that many delight to eate of. It is vsed likewise to be made
into Tartes, and many other varieties of dishes, as Gentlewomen and their
Cookes can better tell than my selfe; vnto whom I leaue the further ordering
of these herbes, and all other fruits and rootes of this Garden: For I

their vse, and no more.</p>

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are so many sorts, and so great diuersitie of Lettice, that I doubt I shall
scarce be beleeued of a great many. For I doe in this Chapter reckon vp into
you eleauen or twelue differing sorts; some of little vse, others of more, being
more common and vulgar; and some that are of excellent vse and seruice, which
are more rare, and require more knowledge and care for the ordering of them, as also
for their time of spending, as some in the spring, some in summer, others in autumne,
and some being whited for the winter. For all these sorts I shall not neede many
descriptions, but only shew you which doe cabbage, and which are loose, which of
them are great or small, white, greene or red, and which of them beare white seeds,
and which of them blacke. And lastly I haue thought good to adde another Sallet
herbe, which because it is called Lambes Lettice of many, or Corne Sallet of others,
is put in only to fill vp a number in this Chapter, and that I must speake of it, and not
that I thinke it to be any of the kindes of Lettice.</p>

<p>All sorts of Lettice, after a while that they haue closed themselues, if they bee of
the Cabbage kindes, or otherwise being loose, and neuer closing, send forth from among
the middle of their leaues a round stalke (in some greater, in others lesser, according
to their kinde) full of leaues like vnto the lower, branching at the toppe into sundry
parts, whereon grow diuers small star-like flowers, of a pale yellowish colour; after
which come seede, eyther white or blackish, as the plant yeeldeth, whereat hangeth
some small peece of a cottony doune, wherewith the whole head is stored, and is carried
away with the winde, if it be not gathered in time: the roote is somewhat long
and white, with some fibres at it, and perisheth quickely after the seede is ripe.</p>

<p>The Romane red Lettice is the best and greatest of all the rest. For Iohn Tradescante
that first, as I thinke, brought it into England, and sowed it, did write vnto mee,
that after one of them had been bound and whited, when the refuse was cut away, the
rest weighed seuenteene ounces: this hath blacke seede.</p>

<p>The white Romane Lettice is like vnto it, hauing long leaues like a Teasell, it is in
goodnesse next vnto the red, but must be whited, that it may eate kindly: the seede
hereof is white.</p>

<p>The Virginia Lettice hath single and very broade reddish leaues, and is not of any
great regard, and therefore is kept but of a few: it beareth blacke seede.</p>

<p>The common Lumbard Lettice that is loose, and another kinde thereof that doth
somewhat cabbage, haue both white seedes.</p>

<p>The Venice Lettice is an excellent Cabbage Lettice, and is best to bee sowen after
Midsummer for lateward Lettice; they be sometimes as great as the crowne of a mans
hatt: the seede hereof is white, and groweth to be of a meane height.</p>

<p>Our common Cabbage Lettice is well known, and beareth blacke seede.</p>

<p>The curld Lettice which is open, and differeth but little from Endiue, beareth black
seede.</p>

<p>Another sort of curld Lettice doth cabbage, and is called Flanders Cropers, or
Cropers of Bruges; this groweth lowest, and hath the smallest head, but very hard and
round, and white while it groweth: the seed is blacke.</p>

<p>A kinde of Romane Lettice is of a darke green colour, growing as low as the Venice
Lettice, and is an excellent kinde, bearing blacke seede.</p>

<p>And lastly our winter Lettice is wonderfull hardy to endure our cold: It is but single,
and must be sowen at Michaelmas, but will be very good, before any of the other
good sorts sowen in the Spring, will be ready to be vsed, and beareth white seed.</p>

<p>To instruct a nouice (for I teach not a Gardiner of knowledge) how to gather his
seede that it may be good, is in this manner: Let him marke out those plants that hee
meaneth shall run vp for seede, which must be the most likely; &amp; after they haue begun
to shoote forth stalkes, strip away the lowest leaues, for two or three hands breadth aboue
the ground, that thereby in taking away the lowest leaues, the stalke doe not rot,
nor the seed be hindered in the ripening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two manner of wayes to whiten Lettice to make them eate the more tender:
the one is by raysing vp earth like moale hils, round about the plants while they
are growing, which will make them grow white: the other is by tying vp all the loose
leaues round together while it groweth, that so the close tying may make it grow
white, and thereby be the more tender.</p>

<p>Lambes Lettice or Corne Sallet is a small plant while it is young, growing close vpon
the ground, with many whitish greene, long and narrow, round pointed leaues, all
the winter, and in the beginning of the spring (if it bee sowen in autumne, as it is vsuall
to serue for an early sallet) riseth vp with small round stalkes, with two leaues at euery
ioynt, branching forth at the toppe, and bearing tufts of small bleake blew flowers,
which turne into small round whitish seede: the roote is small and long, with some
small threds hanging thereat: the whole plant is of a waterish taste, almost insipide.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Lettice.</h4>

<p>All sorts of Lettice are spent in sallets, with oyle and vinegar, or as euery
one please, for the most part, while they are fresh and greene, or whited, as
is declared of some of the sorts before, to cause them to eate the more delicate
and tender. They are also boyled, to serue for many sorts of dishes of
meate, as the Cookes know best.</p>

<p>They all coole a hot and fainting stomacke.</p>

<p>The iuice of Lettice applyed with oyle of Roses to the foreheads of the
sicke and weake wanting sleepe, procureth rest, and taketh away paines in
the head: bound likewise to the cods, it helpeth those that are troubled
with the Colts euill. If a little camphire be added, it restraineth immoderate
lust: but it is hurtfull to such as are troubled with the shortnesse of breath.</p>

<p>Lambes Lettice is wholly spent for sallets, in the beginning of the yeare,
as I said, before any almost of the other sorts of Lettice are to be had.</p>

diuers branches of greene leaues, shorter and smaller then Fennell vp to the toppe, at

berries, greene at the first, and of an excellent red colour when they are ripe, shewing

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere is greater diuersity in the forme and colour of the leaues of this plant,
then there is in any other that I know groweth vpon the ground. But this
place requireth not the knowledge of all sorts which might be shewen, many
of them being of no vse with vs for the table, but for delight, to behold the wonderfull
variety of the workes of God herein. I will here therefore shew you onely those
sorts that are ordinary in most Gardens, and some that are rare, receiued into some especiall
Gardens: And first of Cabbages, and then of Coleworts.</p>

<p>Our ordinary Cabbage that closeth hard and round, hath at the first great large
thicke leaues, of a grayish greene colour, with thicke great ribbes, and lye open most
part of the Summer without closing, but toward the end of Summer, being growne to
haue many leaues, it then beginneth to growe close and round in the middle, and as it
closeth, the leaues growe white inward; yet there be some kindes that will neuer be so
close as these, but will remaine halfe open, which wee doe not account to be so good
as the other: in the middle of this head, the next yeare after the sowing, in other
Countries especially, and sometimes in ours, if the Winter be milde, as may be seene
in diuers Gardens (but to preuent the danger of our Winter frosts, our Gardiners now
doe vse to take vp diuers Cabbages with their rootes, and tying a cloth or some such
thing about the rootes, doe hang them vp in their houses, where they may be defended
from cold, and then set them againe after the frosts are past) and then there shooteth
out a great thicke stalke, diuided at the toppe into many branches, bearing thereon
diuers small flowers, sometime white, but most commonly yellow, made of foure
leaues, which turne into long, round, and pointed pods, containing therein small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
round seede, like vnto Turnep seede: the roote spreadeth not farre nor deepe, and
dyeth vsually in any great froste; for a small frost maketh the Cabbage eate the tenderer.</p>

<p>The red Cabbage is like vnto the white, last spoken of, but differing in colour and
greatnesse; for it is seldome found so great as the white, and the colour of the leaues
is very variable, as being in some stript with red, in others more red, or very deepe
red or purple.</p>

<p>The sugar loafe Cabbage, so called because it is smaller at the toppe then it is at the
bottome, and is of two sorts, the one white, the other greene.</p>

<p>The Sauoy Cabbadge, one is of a deepe greene coloured leafe, and curld when it is
to be gathered; the other is yellowish: neyther of both these doe close so well as the
first, but yet are vsed of some, and accounted good.</p>

<p>The Cole flower is a kinde of Coleworte, whose leaues are large, and like the Cabbage
leaues, but somewhat smaller, and endented about the edges, in the middle wherof,
sometimes in the beginning of Autumne, and sometimes much sooner, there appeareth
a hard head of whitish yellow tufts of flowers, closely thrust together, but neuer
open, nor spreading much with vs, which then is fittest to be vsed, the green leaues
being cut away close to the head: this hath a much pleasanter taste then eyther the
Coleworte, or Cabbage of any kinde, and is therefore of the more regard and respect
at good mens tables.</p>

<p>The ordinary Coleworte is sufficiently knowne not to close or cabbage, and giueth
seede plentifully enough.</p>

<p>The other Colewortes that are noursed vp with those that delight in curiosities, besides
the aforesaid ordinary greene, which is much vsed of Dutchmen, and other strangers,
are these: The Curld Coleworte eyther wholly of a greene colour, or of diuers
colours in one plant, as white, yellow, red, purple or crimson, so variably mixed,
the leaues being curld on the edges, like a ruffe band, that it is very beautifull to behold.</p>

<p>There is also another curld Colewort of lesse beauty and respect, being but a little
curld on the edges, whose leaues are white, edged with red, or green edged with white.</p>

<p>Two other there are, the one of a popingaye greene colour: the other of a fine
deepe greene, like vnto the Sauoyes.</p>

<p>Then there is the Cole rape, which is also a kinde of Coleworte, that beareth a
white heade, or headed stalke aboue the ground, as bigge as a reasonable Turnep, but
longer, and from the toppe thereof springeth out diuers great leaues, like vnto Colewortes;
among which rise diuers stalkes that beare yellow flowers, and seede in pods,
almost as small as Mustard seede: the roote is somewhat long, and very bushie with
threds.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Cabbages and Colewortes.</h4>

<p>They are most vsually boyled in poudered beefe broth vntil they be tender,
and then eaten with much fat put among them.</p>

<p>The great ribs of the Popingay, and deepe greene Colewortes, beeing
boyled and layde into dishes, are serued to the table with oyle and vinegar
in the Lent time for very good sallets.</p>

<p>In the cold Countries of Russia and Muscouia, they pouder vp a number
of Cabbages, which serue them, especially the poorer sort, for their most
ordinary foode in winter; and although they stinke most grieuously, yet to
them they are accounted good meate.</p>

<p>It is thought, that the vse of them doth hinder the milke in Nurses breasts,
causing it to dry vp quickely: but many women that haue giuen sucke to
my knowledge haue denyed that assertion, affirming that they haue often
eaten them, and found no such effect. How it might proue in more delicate
bodies then theirs that thus said, I cannot tell but Matthiolus auerreth it to
encrease milke in Nurses breastes; so differing are the opinions of many.
The seede grossely bruised and boyled a little in flesh broth, is a present remedie
for the Collicke; the seede and the broth being taken together, easing
them that are troubled therewith of all griping paines: as also for the
stone in the kidneyes. A Lohoc or licking Electuary made of the pulpe of
the boyled stalkes, and a little honey and Almond milke, is very profitable
for shortnesse of breath, and those that are entering into a Consumption of
the lunges. It hath beene formerly held to be helpefull in all diseases: for
Crisippus, an ancient Physitian, wrote a whole Volume of the vertues, applying
it to all the parts of the body: which thing neede not seeme wonderfull,
in that it is recorded by writers, that the old Romanes hauing expelled
Physitians out of their Common-wealth, did for many hundred of
yeares maintaine their health by the vse of Cabbages, taking them for euery
disease.</p>

leaues, set each against other vpon a middle ribbe, and euery one snipt about the edges:
the stalke riseth vp two or three foote high, set with the like leaues, hauing at the toppe
spoakie tufts of white flowers, which turne into small seede, somewhat bigger and
darker then Parsley seede: the rootes be many growing together at one head, beeing
long, slender, &amp; rugged or vneuen, of a whitish colour on the outside, and more white
within, hauing in the middle of the roote a long small hard pith or string: these heads
are vsually taken vp in February and March, or sooner if any so please, the greater
number of them being broken off to bee vsed, the rest are planted againe after the
heads are separated, and hereby they are encreased euery yeare by many; but it is now
adayes more sowen of the seed, which come forwards well enough if the ground be

and fry them with butter, after they haue beene boyled, peeled and pithed:
each way, or any way that men please to vse them, they may finde their taste
to be very pleasant, far beyond any Parsnep, as all agree that taste them.</p>

<p>Some doe vse also to eate them as a sallet, colde with vinegar, oyle, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
being first boyled and dressed as before said. They doe helpe to prouoke vrine,

turne to be of a fine red or purple (the beautie whereof allureth many Gentlewomen
oftentimes to gather the leaues, and sticke them in their hats or heads, or pin them on
their armes in stead of feathers): the stalke riseth vp among the leaues, bearing many
likewise vpon it, but nothing so high as the Parsnep, being about three foote high,
bearing many spoakie tufts of white flowers, which turne into small rough seede, as if
it were hairy, smelling reasonable well if it bee rubbed: the roote is round and long,

most common, and they are of two kinds, the one much sweeter then the other.</p>

<p>The yellow and the red are more rare, and noursed vp only by those that are
curious: as also the Navewe, which is seene but with very few.</p>

<p>The ordinary Garden Turnep hath many large, and long rough greene leaues, with
deepe and vneuen gashes on both sides of them: the stalke riseth vp among the leaues
about two foote high, spread at the toppe into many branches, bearing thereon yellow
flowers, which turne into long pods, with blackish round seede in them: the roote is
round and white, some greater, some smaller; the best kinde is knowne to be flat, with
a small pigges tale-like roote vnderneath it; the worser kinde which is more common
in many places of this land, both North and West, is round, and not flat, with a greater
pigges tayle-like roote vnderneath.</p>

<p>The yellow kinde doth often grow very great, it is hardly discerned from the ordinary
kinde while it groweth, but by the greatnesse and spreading of the leaues beeing
boyled, the roote changeth more yellow, somewhat neare the colour of a Carrot.</p>

<p>The red Turnep groweth vsually greater then any of the other, especially in a good
ground, being of a faire red colour on the outside, but being pared, as white as any other
on the inside. This, as Matthiolus saith, doth grow in the Countrey of Anania,
where hee hath seene an infinite number of them that haue waighed fifty pound a
peece, and in some places hee saith, a hundred pound a peece, both which we would
thinke to be incredible, but that we see the kind is greatly giuen to grow, and in warme
Countries they may so thriue, that the bulke or bignesse of the roote may so farre passe
the growth of our Countrey, as that it may rise to that quantity aboue specified.</p>

<p>The Navew gentle is of two kindes, a smaller and a greater; the smaller is vsually
called in France, <i>Naveau de Cane</i>, the roote is somewhat long with the roundnesse;
this kinde is twice as bigge as a mans thumbe, and many of them lesse: The other is
long and great, almost as big as the short Carrot, but for the most part of an vneuen
length, and roundnesse vnto the very end, where it spreadeth into diuers small long
fibres: neyther of them doth differ much from the Turnep, in leafe, flower or seed.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Turneps.</h4>

<p>Being boyled in salt broth, they all of them eate most kindly, and by reason
of their sweetnesse are much esteemed, and often seene as a dish at good
mens tables: but the greater quantitie of them are spent at poore mens
feasts. They nourish much, and engender moist and loose flesh, and are very
windy. The seede of the Navew gentle is (as I take it) called of Andromachus
in the composition of his Treakle, <i>Bunias dulcis</i>: for Dioscorides
and Plinie doe both say, that the seede of the tame Bunias or Napus is put
into Antidotes, and not the seede of the wilde, which is more sharpe and
bitter; neyther the seede of the Turnep, which is called in Greeke <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γογγύλη</span>,
in Latine <i>Rapum</i>, because the seede is not sweete.</p>

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are two principall kindes of Garden Raddish, the one is blackish on the
outside, and the other white; and of both these there is some diuision againe,
as shall be shewed. Dittander and horse Raddish be reckoned kinds thereof.</p>

<p>The ordinary Raddish hath long leaues, vneuenly gashed on both sides, the stalke riseth
vp to the height of three or foure foote, bearing many purplish flowers at the top,
made of foure leaues a peece, which turne into thicke and short pods, wherein are contained
round seede, greater then Turnep or Coleworte seede, and of a pale reddish
colour: the roote is long, white, and of a reddish purple colour on the outside toward
the toppe of it, and of a sharpe biting taste.</p>

<p>There is a small kind of Raddish that commeth earlier then the former, that we haue
had out of the low Countries, not differing in any thing else.</p>

<p>The blacke Raddish I haue had brought me out of the lowe Countries, where they
sell them in some places by the pound, and is accounted with them a rare winter sallet:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
the roote of the best kinde is blackish on the outside (and yet the seede gathered from
such an one, hath after the sowing againe, giuen rootes, whereof some haue beene
blacke, but the most part white on the outside) and white within, great and round at
the head, almost like a Turnep, but ending shorter then a Raddish, and longer then a
Turnep, almost peare-fashion, of a firmer and harder substance then the ordinary Raddish,
but no lesse sharpe and biting, and somewhat strong withall; the leaues are somewhat
smaller, and with deeper gashes, the flower and seede are like the former, but
smaller.</p>

<p>Another sort of blacke Raddish is like in leafe and seede to the former, but the
flower is of a lighter purple colour: the roote is longer and smaller, and changeth
also to bee white as the former doth, so that I thinke they haue both risen from one
kinde.</p>

<p>The Horse Raddish is a kinde of wilde Raddish, but brought into Gardens for the
vse of it, and hath great large and long greene leaues, which are not so much diuided,
but dented about the edges: the roote is long and great, much stronger in taste then
the former, and abideth diuers yeares, spreading with branches vnder ground.</p>

<p>Dittander is likewise a wilde kinde hereof, hauing long pointed blewish greene
leaues, and a roote that creepeth much vnder ground: I confesse this might haue bin
placed among the herbes, because the leaues and not the rootes are vsed; but let it passe
now with the kindes of Raddish.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of these Raddishes.</h4>

<p>Raddishes doe serue vsually as a <i>stimulum</i> before meat, giuing an appetite
thereunto; the poore eate them alone with bread and salt. Some that are
early sowen, are eaten in Aprill, or sooner if the season permit; others
come later; and some are sowen late to serue for the end of Summer: but
(as of all things else) the earlier are the more accepted.</p>

<p>The blacke Raddishes are most vsed in the winter, (yet some in their naturall
and not forc’d grounds, haue their rootes good most part of the Summer)
and therefore must bee sowen after Midsomer; for if they should bee
sowen earlier, they would presently runne vp to stalke and seed, and so lose
the benefit of the roote. The Physicall propertie is, it is often vsed in medicines
that helpe to breake the stone, and to auoyde grauell.</p>

<p>The Horse Raddish is vsed Physically, very much in Melancholicke,
Spleneticke and Scorbuticke diseases. And some vse to make a kinde of
Mustard with the rootes, and eate it with fish.</p>

<p>Dittander or Pepperworte is vsed of some cold churlish stomackes, as a
sawce or sallet sometimes to their meate, but it is too hot, bitter and strong
for weake and tender stomackes.</p>

<p>Our Gardiners about London vse great fences of reede tyed together,
which seemeth to bee a mat set vpright, and is as good as a wall to defend
the cold from those things that would be defended, and to bring them forwards
the earlier.</p>

<p>Wee haue diuers sorts of Onions, both white and red, flat, round and long,
as shall be presently shewed: But I will doe with these as I doe with the
rest, only giue you one description for them all, and afterwards their seuerall
names and varieties, as they are to be known by.</p>

<p>Our common Garden Onion hath diuers long greene hollow leaues, seeming halfe
flat; among which riseth vp a great round hollow stalke, bigger in the middle then any
where else, at the toppe whereof standeth a close round head, couered at the first with
a thin skinne, which breaketh when the head is growne, and sheweth forth a great vmbell
of white flowers, which turne into blacke seede: but then the head is so heauie
that the stalke cannot sustaine it, but must be vpheld from falling to the ground, lest it
rot and perish: the roote as all know is round, in some greater, in others lesser, or flat,
in some red on the outside only, in others quite thorough out, in some white, and very
sharpe and strong, in others milder, and more pleasant, and some so pleasant that they
may be eaten as an Apple: All these kinds of Onions, contrary to the nature of all
other bulbous rootes, haue no off-set, or other roote growing to it, but are euery one
alone single by themselues; and therefore it seemeth, the Latines, as Columella recordeth,
haue giuen it the name <i>Vnio</i>, and the French it should seeme following the
Latine, and the English the French, do call it <i>Oignon</i> and <i>Onion</i>, as an vnite, or as if they
were but one and one, and dye euery yeare after seed bearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512">[512]</a></span></p>

<p>The red flat kinde is most vsually with vs the strongest of them all, yet I haue had a
great red Onion brought mee from beyond Sea, that was as great almost as two mens
fistes, flat and red quite thoroughout, and very pleasant both to smell vnto, and to eate,
but did quickly degenerate; so that we plainly see, that the soyle and climate doth giue
great alteration to plants of all sorts.</p>

<p>The long kinde wee call St. Omers Onions, and corruptly among the vulgar, St.
Thomas Onions.</p>

<p>The other red kinde we call Strasborough Onions, whose outside onely is red, and
are very sharpe and fierce.</p>

<p>The white Onions both long and flat, are like vnto Chalke-stones lying vpon the
ground, when they are ripe and fit to be gathered.</p>

<p>And lastly, there is the Spanish Onion, both long and flat, very sweete, and eaten by
many like an apple, but as Iohn Tradescante saith, who hath beene in Spaine, that the
Spaniards themselues doe not eate them so familiarly, as they doe those white Onions
that come out of our owne Countrey, which they haue there more plentifully then
their sweete Onions.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Onions.</h4>

<p>Onions are vsed many wayes, as sliced and put into pottage, or boyled
and peeled and layde in dishes for sallets at supper, or sliced and put into
water, for a sawce for mutton or oysters, or into meate roasted being stuffed
with Parsly, and so many waies that I cannot recount them, euery one pleasing
themselues, according to their order, manner or delight.</p>

<p>Onions boyled or rosted vnder the embers, and mixed with sugar and
butter, are good for those that are troubled with coughes, shortnesse of
breath, and wheesing. An Onion made hollow at the bottome, and some
good Treakle put into it, with a little iuyce of Citrons (or Lemons in the
stead thereof) being well baked together vnder the embers, after the hole
is stopped againe, and then strained forth, and giuen to one that hath the
plague, is very helpefull, so as hee be laid to sweate vpon it.</p>

<p>The iuice of Onions is much vsed to be applyed to any burnings with fire,
or with Gun-pouder, or to any scaldings with water or oyle, and is most familiar
for the Country, where vpon such sudden occasions they haue not a
more fit or speedy remedie at hand: The strong smell of Onions, and so
also of Garlicke and Leekes, is quite taken away from offending the head
or eyes, by the eating of Parsley leaues after them.</p>

  <span class="line sub-title"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porrum.</i></span>
  <span class="line sub-title">Leekes.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere be likewise sundry sorts of Leekes, both great and small. Leekes are very
like vnto Onions, hauing long green hollow-like leaues, flattish on the one side,
and with a ridge or crest on the backe side: if they bee suffered to grow vncut,
then in the second or third yeare after the sowing, they will send forth a round and
slender stalke, euen quite throughout, and not swollen or bigger in the middle like the
Onion, bearing at the toppe a head of purplish flowers, and blacke seede after them,
very like vnto Onion seede, that it is hard to distinguish them: the root is long and
white, with a great bush of fibres hanging at it, which they call the beards.</p>

<p>The vnset Leeke hath longer and slenderer roots then the other, which being transplanted,
groweth thicker and greater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>

<p>The French Leeke, which is called the Vine Leeke, is the best of all others.</p>

<p>Our common kinde is of two sorts, one greater then another.</p>

<p>Another sort encreaseth altogether by the roote, as Garlicke doth.</p>

<p>And then Ciues, which are the smallest, and encrease aboundantly only by the root.</p>

<p>Some doe account Scalions to be rather a kinde of Onions then Leekes, and call
them <i>Cepa Ascalonica</i>, or <i>Ascalonitides</i>, which will quickly spend it selfe, if it be suffered
to be vncut; but all Authors affirme, that there is no wilde kinde of Onion, vnlesse
they would haue it to be <i>Gethyum</i>, whereof Theophrastus maketh mention, saying,
that it hath a long necke (and so these Scalions haue) and was also of some called <i>Gethyllides</i>,
which antiquity accounted to be dedicated to Latona, the mother of Apollo,
because when she was bigge with childe of Apollo, she longed for these Leekes.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Leekes.</h4>

<p>The old World, as wee finde in Scripture, in the time of the children of
Israels being in Egypt, and no doubt long before, fed much vpon Leekes,
Onions, and Garlicke boyled with flesh; and the antiquity of the Gentiles
relate the same manner of feeding on them, to be in all Countries the like,
which howsoeuer our dainty age now refuseth wholly, in all sorts except
the poorest; yet Muscouia and Russia vse them, and the Turkes to this day,
(as Bellonius writeth) obserue to haue them among their dishes at their tables,
yea although they be <i>Bashas</i>, <i>Cades</i>, or <i>Vaiuodas</i>, that is to say, Lords,
Iudges, or Gouernours of countries and places. They are vsed with vs also
sometimes in Lent to make pottage, and is a great and generall feeding in
Wales with the vulgar Gentlemen.</p>

<p>Ciues are vsed as well to be shred among other herbes for the pot, as to
be put into a Sallet among other herbs, to giue it a quicker relish.</p>

<p>Leekes are held to free the chest and lungs from much corruption and
rotten flegme, that sticketh fast therein, and hard to be auoided, as also for
them that through hoarsenesse haue lost their voice, if they be eyther taken
rawe, or boyled with broth of barley, or some such other supping, fit and
conducing thereunto. And baked vnder hot embers is a remedy against a
surfeit of Mushromes.</p>

<p>The greene blades of Leekes being boyled and applyed warme to the
<i>Hemorrhoides</i> or piles, when they are swolne and painfull, giue a great deale
of ease.</p>

neede in this place to shew onely those kindes, that this Garden nourseth vp, and
leaue the rest to his fit time and place.</p>

<p>Garlicke hath many long greene leaues, like vnto Onions, but much larger, and not
hollow at all as Onions are; the stalke riseth vp to be about three foote high, bearing
such a head at the toppe thereof as Onions and Leekes doe, with purplish flowers,
and blacke seede like Leekes: the roote is white within, couered ouer with many pur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>plish

increase, and also to vse as neede shall require, and is of a very strong smell and taste,
as euery one knoweth, passing either Onions or Leekes, but exceeding wholsome
withall for them that can take it.</p>

  <span class="line">Ramsons.</span>
</h4>

<p>Ramsons are another kinde of Garlicke, and hath two or three faire broade leaues,
of a fresh or light greene colour, pointed at the end: the stalke groweth about an
hand length high, bearing many small and pure white starre-like flowers at the toppe,
and afterwards small, blacke, and smooth round seede: the roote is also diuided into
many parts, whereby it is much encreased, and is much milder then the former, both
in smell and taste.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Garlicke.</h4>

<p>It being well boyled in salt broth, is often eaten of them that haue strong
stomackes, but will not brooke in a weake and tender stomacke.</p>

<p>It is accounted, and so called in diuers Countries, The poore mans Treakle,
that is, a remedy for all diseases. It is neuer eaten rawe of any man that I
know, as other of the rootes aforesaid, but sodden alwaies and so taken.</p>

<p>Ramsons are oftentimes eaten with bread and butter, and otherwise also,
as euery mans affection and course of life leadeth him to vse.</p>

sort, a long slender spike of small horned or crooked flowers, which open their
brimmes into foure leaues; in the lesser many small purplish bels, standing vpon seuerall

smooth and hollow, bearing thereon many such like leaues, but smaller and shorter,

very good and pleasant taste. This kinde, as also another with narrower leaues, almost
like grasse, growe wilde abroad in many places, but are brought into diuers Gardens.
The other two kindes formerly described in the first part, the one with a purple flower,

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ree sorts of Potatoes are well knowne vnto vs, but the fourth I rest doubtfull
of, and dare not affirme it vpon such termes as are giuen vnto it, vntill I may
be better informed by mine owne sight.</p>

<p>The Spanish kinde hath (in the Islands where they growe, either naturally, or planted
for increase, profit, and vse of the Spaniards that nourse them) many firme and verie
sweete rootes, like in shape and forme vnto Asphodill rootes, but much greater
and longer, of a pale browne on the outside, and white within, set together at one
head; from whence rise vp many long branches, which by reason of their weight
and weaknesse, cannot stand of themselues, but traile on the ground a yard and a
halfe in length at the least (I relate it, as it hath growne with vs, but in what other
forme, for flower or fruit, we know not) whereon are set at seuerall distances, broad
and in a manner three square leaues, somewhat like triangled Iuie leaues, of a darke
greene colour, the two sides whereof are broad and round, and the middle pointed at
the end, standing reasonable close together: thus much we haue seene growe with vs,
and no more: the roote rather decaying then increasing in our country.</p>

<p>The Potatoes of Virginia, (Bauhinus
vpon Matthiolus calleth it, <i>Solanum tuberosum esculentum</i> which some foolishly call the Apples of youth) is another
kinde of plant, differing much from the former, sauing in the colour and taste of
the roote, hauing many weake and somewhat flexible branches, leaning a little downwards,
or easily borne downe with the winde or other thing, beset with many winged
leaues, of a darke grayish greene colour, whereof diuers are smaller, and some greater
then others: the flowers growe many together vpon a long stalke, comming forth
from betweene the leaues and the great stalkes, euery one seuerally vpon a short foot-stalke,
somewhat like the flower of Tabacco for the forme, being one whole leafe six
cornered at the brimmes, but somewhat larger, and of a pale blewish purple colour,
or pale doue colour, and some almost white, with some red threads in the middle,
standing about a thicke gold yellow pointell, tipped with greene at the end: after the
flowers are past, there come vp in their places small round fruit, as bigge as a Damson
or Bulleis, greene at the first, and somewhat whitish afterwards, with many white
seedes therein, like vnto Nightshade: the rootes are rounder and much smaller then
the former, and some much greater then others, dispersed vnder ground by many
small threads or strings from the rootes, of the same light browne colour on the outside,
and white within, as they, and neare of the same taste, but not altogether so
pleasant.</p>

<p>The Potatos of Canada, (which hath diuers names giuen it by diuers men, as Pelleterius of Middleborough
in his <i>Plantarum Synonimia</i>, calleth it <i>Heliotropium Indicum tuberosum</i>, Fabius Columna
in the second part of his <i>Phytobasanos</i>, <i>Flos Solis Farnesianus</i>, <i>siue Aster Peruanus tuberosus</i>:
We in England, from some ignorant and idle head, haue called them Artichokes
of Ierusalem, only because the roote, being boyled, is in taste like the bottome of an
Artichoke head: but they may most fitly be called, Potatos of Canada, because their
rootes are in forme, colour and taste, like vnto the Potatos of Virginia, but greater,
and the French brought them first from Canada into these parts) riseth vp with diuers
stiffe, round stalkes, eight or tenne foote high in our Country, where they haue scarce
shewed their flowers, whereas the very head of flowers in other Countries, as Fabius
Columna expresseth it, being of a Pyramis or Sugar loafe fashion, broade spreading
below, and smaller pointed vpwards towards the toppe, is neere of the same length,
whereon are set large and broade rough greene leaues, very like vnto the leaues of the
flower of the Sunne, but smaller, yet growing in the very same manner, round about
the stalkes: at the very later end of Summer, or the beginning of Autumne, if the
roote bee well planted and defended, it will giue a shew of a few small yellow flowers
at the top, like vnto the flowers of <i>Aster</i> or Starre-worte, and much smaller then any
flower of the Sunne, which come to no perfection with vs: the roote, while the plant
is growing aboue ground, encreaseth not to his full growth, but when the Summer is
well spent, and the springing of the stalk is past, which is about the end of August, or in
September, then the root is perceiued to be encreased in the earth, and will before Autumne
be spent, that is, in October, swell like a mound or hillocke, round about the
foote of the stalkes, and will not haue his rootes fit to be taken vp, vntill the stalkes be
halfe withered at the soonest; but after they be withered, and so all the winter long
vntill the Spring againe, they are good, and fit to bee taken vp and vsed, which are a
number of tuberous round rootes, growing close together; so that it hath beene obserued,
that from one roote, being set in the Spring, there hath been forty or more taken
vp againe, and to haue ouer-filled a pecke measure, and are of a pleasant good taste
as many haue tryed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

Fieldes, of purpose to be meate for men.</p>

<p>The Artichoke hath diuers great, large, and long hollowed leaues, much cut in or
torne on both edges, without any great shew of prickles on them, of a kinde of whitish
greene, like vnto an ash colour, whereof it tooke the Latin name <i>Cinara</i>: the
stalke is strong, thicke and round, with some skins as it were downe all the length of
them, bearing at the toppe one scaly head, made at the first like a Pine-apple, but after
growing greater, the scales are more separate, yet in the best kindes lying close, and
not flaring, as some other kindes doe, which are eyther of a reddish browne, whitish,
or greenish colour, and in some broade at the ends, in others sharpe or prickly: after
the head hath stoode a great while, if it bee suffered, and the Summer proue hot and

colour, like the leaues, whereas the former is reddish.</p>

<p>We haue also another, whose head is greene, and very sharpe vpwards, and is common
in many places.</p>

<p>Wee haue had also another kinde in former times that grew as high as any man, and
branched into diuers stalkes, euery one bearing a head thereon, almost as bigge as the
first.</p>

<p>There is another kinde, called the Muske Artichoke, which groweth like the French
kinde, but is much better in spending, although it haue a lesser bottome.</p>

<p>The French Artichoke hath a white head, the scales whereof stand staring far asunder
one from another at the ends, which are sharpe: this is well known by this qualitie,
that while it is hot after it is boyled, it smelleth so strong, that one would verily
thinke it had bin boyled in stinking water, which was brought ouer after a great froste
that had well nigh consumed our best kindes, and are now almost cleane cast out again,
none being willing to haue it take vp the roome of better.</p>

<p>There is a lowe kinde that groweth much about Paris, which the French esteeme
more then any other, and is lower then the former French kinde, the head whereof
as well as the leaues, is of a fresher greene colour, almost yellowish.</p>

<p>Then there is the Thistle Artichoke, which is almost a wilde kinde, and groweth
smaller, with a more open and prickly head then any of the former.</p>

<p>And lastly, the Chardon as they call it, because it is almost of the forme and nature
of a Thistle, or wilde Artichoke. This groweth high, and full of sharpe prickles, of
a grayish colour. Iohn Tradescante assured mee, hee saw three acres of Land about
Brussels planted with this kinde, which the owner whited like Endiue, and then sold
them in the winter: Wee cannot yet finde the true manner of dressing them, that our
Countrey may take delight therein.</p>

<p>All these kindes are encreased by slipping the young shootes from the root, which
being replanted in February, March, or Aprill, haue the same yeare many times, but the
next at the most, borne good heads.</p>

<p>Wee finde by dayly experience, that our English red Artichoke is in our Countrey
the most delicate meate of any of the other, and therefore diuers thinking it to bee
a seuerall kinde, haue sent them into Italie, France, and the Lowe Countries, where
they haue not abode in their goodnesse aboue two yeare, but that they haue degenerated;
so that it seemeth, that our soyle and climate hath the preheminence to nourish
vp this plant to his highest excellencie.</p>

<p>The manner of preparing them for the Table is well knowne to the
youngest Housewife I thinke, to bee boyled in faire water, and a little
salt, vntill they bee tender, and afterwardes a little vinegar and pepper,
put to the butter, poured vpon them for the sawce, and so are serued
to the Table.</p>

<p>They vse likewise to take the boyled bottomes to make Pyes, which is a

  <span class="line sub-title">Garden and French Beanes.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e Garden Beane is of two colours, red or blacke, and white, yet both rise
from one; the small or fielde Beanes I make no mention of in this place; but
the French or Kidney Beane is almost of infinite sorts and colours: we doe not
for all that intend to trouble you in this place, with the knowledge or relation of any
more then is fit for a Garden of that nature, that I haue propounded it in the beginning.</p>

<p>Our ordinary Beanes, seruing for foode for the poorer sort for the most part, are
planted as well in fieldes as in gardens, because the quantity of them that are spent taketh
vp many acres of land to be planted in, and rise vp with one, two or three stalks,
according to the fertilitie of the soyle, being smooth and square, higher then any
man oftentimes, whereon are set at certaine distances, from the very bottome almost
to the toppe, two long smooth fleshy and thicke leaues almost round, one standing by
another at the end of a small footestalke: betweene these leaues and the stalke, come
forth diuers flowers, all of them looking one way for the most part, which are close
a little turned vp at the brimmes, white and spotted with a blackish spot in the middle
of them, and somewhat purplish at the foot or bottome, of the forme almost of Broome
or Pease flowers, many of which that grow vpward toward the toppe, doe seldome
beare fruit, and therefore are gathered to distill, and the toppes of the stalkes cut off,
to cause the rest to thriue the better; after which grow vp long great smooth greene
pods, greater then in any other kinde of Pulse, which grow blacke when they are ripe,
and containe within them two, three or foure Beanes, which are somewhat flat and
round, eyther white or reddish, which being full ripe grow blackish: the roote hath
diuers fibres annexed vnto the maine roote, which dyeth euery yeare.</p>

<p>The French or Kidney Beane riseth vp at the first but with one stalke, which afterwards
diuideth it selfe into many armes or branches, euery one of them being so weak,
that without they be sustained with stickes or poles, whereon with their winding and
claspers they take hold, they would lye fruitlesse vpon the ground: vpon these branches
grow forth at seuerall places long footestalkes, with euery of them three broade,
round and pointed greene leaues at the end of them, towards the tops whereof come
forth diuers flowers, made like vnto Pease blossomes, of the same colour for the most
part that the fruit will be of, that is to say, eyther white, or yellow, or red, or blackish,
or of a deepe purple <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> but white is most vsuall for our Garden; after which come
long and slender flat pods, some crooked, and some straight, with a string as it were
running downe the backe thereof, wherein are contained flattish round fruit, made to
the fashion of a kidney: the roote is long, and spreadeth with many fibres annexed vnto
it, perishing euery yeare.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of these Beanes.</h4>

<p>The Garden Beanes serue (as I said before) more for the vse of the poore
then of the rich: I shall therefore only shew you the order the poore take
with them, and leaue curiosity to them that will bestow time vpon them.
They are only boyled in faire water and a little salt, and afterwards stewed
with some butter, a little vinegar and pepper being put vnto them, and so
eaten: or else eaten alone after they are boyled without any other sawce.
The water of the blossomes distilled, is vsed to take away spots, and to cleer
the skin. The water of the greene huskes or cods is good for the stone.</p>

<p>The Kidney Beanes boyled in water huske and all, onely the ends cut off,
and the string taken away, and stewed with butter <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> are esteemed more
sauory meate to many mens pallates, then the former, and are a dish more
oftentimes at rich mens Tables then at the poore.</p>

country, and some in others: I shall giue you the description of one alone for

<p>Garden Pease are for the most part the greatest and sweetest kinds, and are sustained
with stakes or bushes. The Field Pease are not so vsed, but growe without any such
adoe. They spring vp with long, weake, hollow, and brittle (while they are young
and greene) whitish greene stalkes, branched into diuers parts, and at euery ioynt
where it parteth one broad round leafe compassing the stalke about, so that it commeth
as it were thorough it: the leaues are winged, made of diuers small leaues set to
a middle ribbe, of a whitish greene colour, with claspers at the ends of the leaues,
whereby it taketh hold of whatsoeuer standeth next vnto it: betweene the leaues and
the stalkes come forth the flowers, standing two or three together, euery one by it
selfe on his owne seuerall stalke, which are either wholly white, or purple, or mixed
white and purple, or purple and blew: the fruit are long, and somewhat round cods,
whereof some are greater, others lesser, some thicke and short, some plaine and smooth,
others a little crooked at the ends; wherein also are contained diuers formes of fruit
or pease; some being round, others cornered, some small, some great, some white, others
gray, and some spotted: the roote is small, and quickly perisheth.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">O<span class="looks_big">f</span> Cowcumbers there are diuers sorts, differing chiefly in the forme and colour
of the fruit, and not in the forme of the plant; therefore one description
shall serue in stead of all the rest.</p>

<p>The Cowcumber bringeth forth many trailing rough greene branches lying on the
ground, all along whereof growe seuerall leaues, which are rough, broad, vneuen at the
edges, and pointed at the ends, with long crooked tendrils comming forth at the same
ioynt with the leafe, but on the other side thereof: between the stalks &amp; the leaues at the
ioynts come forth the flowers seuerally, euery one standing on a short foot-stalke, opening
it selfe into fiue leaues, of a yellowish colour, at the bottome whereof groweth the
fruit, long and greene at the first, but when it is thorough ripe, a little yellowish, hauing
many furrowes, and vneuen bunches all the length of it, wherein is a white firme
substance next vnto the skin, and a cleare pulpe or watery substance, with white flat
seede lying dispersed through it: the roote is long and white, with diuers fibres at it.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The kindes.</h4>

<p>The first described is called, The long greene Cowcumber.</p>

<p>There is another is called, The short Cowcumber, being short, and of an
equall bignesse in the body thereof, and of an vnequall bignesse at both
ends.</p>

<p>The long Yellow, which is yellowish from the beginning, and more yellow
when it is ripe, and hath beene measured to be thirteene inches long:
but this is not that small long Cowcumber, called of the Latines, <i>Cucumis
anguinus</i>.</p>

<p>Another kinde is early ripe, called The French kinde.</p>

<p>The Dantsicke kinde beareth but small fruit, growing on short branches
or runners: the pickled Cowcumbers that are vsually sold are of this kind.</p>

<p>The Muscouie kinde is the smallest of all other, yet knowne, and beareth
not aboue foure or fiue at the most on a roote, which are no bigger then
small Lemons.</p>
</div>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Cowcumbers.</h4>

<p>Some vse to cast a little salt on their sliced Cowcumbers, and let them
stand halfe an houre or more in a dish, and then poure away the water that
commeth from them by the salt, and after put vinegar, oyle, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> thereon, as
euery one liketh: this is done, to take away the ouermuch waterishnesse and
coldnesse of the Cowcumbers.</p>

<p>In many countries they vse to eate Cowcumbers as wee doe Apples or
Peares, paring and giuing slices of them, as we would to our friends of some
dainty Apple or Peare.</p>

<p>The pickled Cowcumbers that come from beyond Sea, are much vsed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>with vs for sawce to meate all the Winter long. Some haue striuen to equall
them, by pickling vp our Cowcumbers at the later end of the yeare, when
they are cheapest, taking the little ones and scalding them thoroughly well,
which after they put in brine, with some Dill or Fenell leaues and stalkes:
but these are nothing comparable to the former, wee either missing of the
right and orderly pickling of them, or the kinde it selfe differing much from
ours (as I said of the Dantsicke kinde) for ours are neither so tender and
firme, nor so sauoury as the other.</p>

<p>The rawe or greene Cowcumbers are fittest for the hotter time of the
yeare, and for hot stomackes, and not to be vsed in colder weather or cold
stomackes, by reason of the coldnesse, whereby many haue been ouertaken.</p>

<p>The seede is vsed physically in many medicines that serue to coole, and a
little to make the passages of vrine slippery, and to giue ease to hot diseases.</p>

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere bee diuers sorts of Melons found out at this day, differing much in the
goodnesse of taste one from another. This Countrey hath not had vntill of
late yeares the skill to nourse them vp kindly, but now there are many that are
so well experienced therein, and haue their ground so well prepared, as that they will
not misse any yeare, if it be not too extreme vnkindly, to haue many ripe ones in a reasonable
time: yet some will be later then others alwayes.</p>

<p>The Melon is certainly a kinde of Cowcumber, it doth so neere resemble it, both
in the manner of his growing, hauing rough trailing branches, rough vneuen leaues,
and yellow flowers: after which come the fruit, which is rounder, thicker, bigger,
more rugged, and spotted on the outside then the Cowcumber, of a russet colour, and
greene vnderneath, which when it groweth full ripe, will change a little yellowish,
being as deepe furrowed and ribbed as they, and besides hauing chaps or rifts in diuers
places of the rinde: the inward hard substance is yellow, which onely is eaten:
the seede which is bigger, and a little yellower then the Cowcumber, lying in the middle
onely among the moister pulpe: the smell and changing of his colour, fore-shew
their ripenesse to them that are experienced: the roote is long, with many fibres at it.
The fruit requireth much watering in the hot time of the day, to cause them to ripen
the sooner, as I haue obserued by diuers of the best skill therein.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of the kindes of Melons.</h4>

<p>The best Melon seede doe come to vs out of Spaine, some haue come out
of Turkie, but they haue been nothing so good and kindly.</p>

<p>Some are called Sugar Melons, others Peare Melons, and others Muske
Melons.</p>

<p>They haue beene formerly only eaten by great personages, because the
fruit was not only delicate but rare; and therefore diuers were brought from
France, and since were noursed vp by the Kings or Noblemens Gardiners
onely, to serue for their Masters delight: but now diuers others that haue
skill and conueniencie of ground for them, doe plant them and make them
more common.</p>

<p>They paire away the outer rinde, and cut out the inward pulpe where
the seede lyeth, slice the yellow firme inward rinde or substance, &amp; so eate it
with salt and pepper (and good store of wine, or else it will hardly digest)
for this is firmer, &amp; hath not that moisture in it that the Cowcumbers haue.
It is also more delicate, and of more worth, which recompenseth the paine.</p>

<p>The seed of these Melons are vsed as Cowcumbers physically, and together
with them most vsually.</p>

the diuersities of bignesse and colour.</p>

<p>The Pompion or great Melon (or as some call it Milion) creepeth vpon
the ground (if nothing bee by it whereon it may take hold and climbe) with very
great, ribbed, rough, and prickly branches, whereon are set very large rough leaues,
cut in on the edges with deepe gashes, and dented besides, with many claspers also,
which winde about euery thing they meete withall: the flowers are great and large,
hollow and yellow, diuided at the brims into fiue parts, at the bottome of which, as it
is in the rest, groweth the fruit, which is very great, sometimes of the bignesse of a
mans body, and oftentimes lesse, in some ribbed or bunched, in others plaine, and either
long or round, either greene or yellow, or gray, as Nature listeth to shew her selfe;
for it is but waste time, to recite all the formes and colours may be obserued in them:
the inner rinde next vnto the outer is yellowish and firme: the seede is great, flat, and
white, lying in the middle of the watery pulpe: the roote is of the bignesse of a mans
thumbe or greater, dispersed vnder ground with many small fibres ioyned thereunto.</p>

<p>Gourds are kindes of Melons; but because wee haue no vse of them, wee leaue
them vnto their fit place.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Pompions.</h4>

<p>They are boyled in faire water and salt, or in powdered beefe broth, or
sometimes in milke, and so eaten, or else buttered; They vse likewise to take
out the inner watery substance with the seedes, and fill vp the place with
Pippins, and hauing laid on the couer which they cut off from the toppe,
to take out the pulpe, they bake them together, and the poore of the Citie,
as well as the Country people, doe eate thereof, as of a dainty dish.</p>

<p>The seede hereof, as well as of Cowcumbers and Melons, are cooling,
and serue for emulsions in the like manner for Almond milkes, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> for those

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere be diuers sorts of Strawberries, whereof those that are noursed vp in Gardens
or Orchards I intend to giue you the knowledge in this place, and leaue
the other to a fitter; yet I must needs shew you of one of the wilde sorts, which
for his strangenesse is worthy of this Garden: And I must also enforme you, that the
wilde Strawberry that groweth in the Woods is our Garden Strawberry, but bettered
by the soyle and transplanting.</p>

<p>The Strawberry hath his leaues closed together at the first springing vp, which afterwards
spread themselues into three diuided parts or leaues, euery one standing vpon
a small long foote-stalke, greene on the vpperside, grayish vnderneath, and snipped
or dented about the edges; among which rise vp diuers small stalkes, bearing foure or
fiue flowers at the tops, consisting of fiue white round pointed leaues, somewhat yellowish
in the bottome, with some yellow threads therein; after which come the fruit,
made of many small graines set together, like vnto a small Mulberry or Raspis, reddish
when it is ripe, and of a pleasant winy taste, wherein is enclosed diuers small blackish
seede; the roote is reddish and long, with diuers small threads at it, and sendeth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
forth from the head thereof long reddish strings running vpon the ground, which shoot
forth leaues in many places, whereby it is much encreased.</p>

<p>The white Strawberry differeth not from the red, but in the colour of the fruite,
which is whiter then the former when it is thorough ripe, enclining to rednesse.</p>

<p>The greene Strawberry likewise differeth not, but that the fruit is green on all sides
when it is ripe, saue on that side the Sun lyeth vpon it, and there it is somewhat red.</p>

<p>The Virginia Strawberry carryeth the greatest leafe of any other, except the Bohemian,
but scarce can one Strawberry be seene ripe among a number of plants; I thinke
the reason thereof to be the want of skill, or industry to order it aright. For the Bohemia,
and all other Strawberries will not beare kindly, if you suffer them to grow with
many strings, and therefore they are still cut away.</p>

<p>There is another very like vnto this, that Iohn Tradescante brought with him from
Brussels long agoe, and in seuen yeares could neuer see one berry ripe on all sides, but
still the better part rotten, although it would euery yeare flower abundantly, and beare
very large leaues.</p>

<p>The Bohemia Strawberry hath beene with vs but of late dayes, but is the goodliest
and greatest, both for leafe next to the Virginian, and for beauty farre surpassing all;
for some of the berries haue beene measured to bee neere fiue inches about. Master
Quester the Postmaster first brought them ouer into our Country, as I vnderstand, but
I know no man so industrious in the carefull planting and bringing them to perfection
in that plentifull maner, as Master Vincent Sion who dwelt on the Banck side, neer the
old Paris garden staires, who from seuen rootes, as hee affirmed to me, in one yeare
and a halfe, planted halfe an acree of ground with the increase from them, besides those
he gaue away to his friends, and with him I haue seene such, and of that bignesse before
mentioned.</p>

<p>One Strawberry more I promised to shew you, which although it be a wilde kinde,
and of no vse for meate, yet I would not let this discourse passe, without giuing you
the knowledge of it. It is in leafe much like vnto the ordinary, but differeth in that
the flower, if it haue any, is greene, or rather it beareth a small head of greene leaues,
many set thicke together like vnto a double ruffe, in the midst whereof standeth the
fruit, which when it is ripe, sheweth to be soft and somewhat reddish, like vnto a Strawberry,
but with many small harmlesse prickles on them, which may be eaten and chewed
in the mouth without any maner of offence, and is somewhat pleasant like a Strawberry:
it is no great bearer, but those it doth beare, are set at the toppes of the stalks
close together, pleasant to behold, and fit for a Gentlewoman to weare on her arme,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> as a raritie instead of a flower.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Strawberries.</h4>

<p>The leaues of Strawberries are alwaies vsed among other herbes in cooling
drinkes, as also in lotions, and gargles for the mouth and throate: the
rootes are sometimes added to make it the more effectuall, and withall somwhat
the more binding.</p>

<p>The berries themselues are often brought to the Table as a reare seruice,
whereunto claret wine, creame or milke is added with sugar, as euery one liketh;
as also at other times, both with the better and meaner sort, and are a
good cooling and pleasant dish in the hot Summer season.</p>

<p>The water distilled of the berries, is good for the passions of the heart,
caused by the perturbation of the spirits, being eyther drunke alone, or in
wine; and maketh the heart merry.</p>

<p>Some doe hold that the water helpeth to clense the face from spots, and
to adde some cleerenesse to the skinne.</p>

&amp; fruits fit for it, and for any mans priuate vse, as I did at the first appropriate
it; let me a little transcend, and for the profit &amp; vse of Country Gentlewomen
and others, furnish them with some few other herbes, of the most especiall vse for those
shall need them, to be planted at hand in their Gardens, to spend as occasion shall serue,
and first of Angelica.</p>

<p>Angelica hath great and long winged leaues, made of many broade greene ones,
diuided one from another vpon the stalk, which is three foot long or better somtimes,
among which rise vp great thicke and hollow stalkes with some few ioynts, whereat
doth alwayes stand two long leaues compassing the stalke at the bottome, in some places
at the ioynts spring out other stalkes or branches, bearing such like leaues but smaller,
and at the tops very large vmbels of white flowers, that turne into whitish seede
somewhat thicke: the roote groweth great with many branches at it, but quickly perisheth
after it hath borne seede: to preserue the roote therefore the better, they vse to
cut it often in the yeare, thereby to hinder the running vp to seede: the whole plant,
both leafe, roote and seede, is of an excellent comfortable sent, sauour and taste.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Angelica.</h4>

<p>The distilled water of Angelica, eyther simple or compound, is of especiall
vse <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in deliquium animi, vel cordis tremores &amp; passiones</i>, that is, swounings,
when the spirits are ouercome and faint, or tremblings and passions of the
heart, to expell any windy or noysome vapours from it. The green stalkes or
the young rootes being preserued or candied, are very effectuall to comfort
and warme a colde and weake stomacke: and in the time of infection is of
excellent good vse to preserue the spirits and heart from infection. The
dryed roote made into pouder, and taken in wine or other drinke, will abate
the rage of lust in young persons, as I haue it related vnto me vpon credit:
A Syrupe made thereof in this manner, is very profitable to expectorate
flegme out of the chest and lunges, and to procure a sweete breath. Into the
greene stalke of Angelica as it standeth growing, make a great gashe or incision,
wherein put a quantitie of fine white Sugar, letting it there abide for
three dayes, and after take it forth by cutting a hole at the next ioynt vnder
the cut, where the Syrupe resteth, or cut off the stalke, and turne it downe,
that the Syrrupe may drayne forth; which keepe for a most delicate medicine.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">A<span class="looks_big">l</span>though there are two sorts of Licorice set downe by diuers Authors, yet because
this Land familiarly is acquainted but with one sort, I shall not neede for
this Garden, to make any further relation of that is vnknowne, but onely of
that sort which is sufficiently frequent with vs. It riseth vp with diuers wooddy stalks,
whereon are set at seuerall distances many winged leaues, that is to say, many narrow
long greene leaues set together on both sides of the stalke, and an odde one at the end,
very well resembling a young Ashe tree sprung vp from the seede: this by many
yeares continuance in a place without remouing, and not else, will bring forth flowers
many standing together spike-fashion one aboue another vpon the stalkes, of the forme
of Pease blossomes, but of a very pale or bleake blew colour, which turne into long
somewhat flat and smooth cods, wherein is contained small round harde seede: the
roote runneth downe exceeding deep into the ground, with diuers other smaller roots
and fibres growing with them, and shoote out suckers from the maine rootes all about,
whereby it is much encreased, of a brownish colour on the outside, and yellow within,
of a farre more weake sweete taste, yet far more pleasing to vs then that Licorice that
is brought vs from beyond Sea; because that, being of a stronger sweet taste hath a
bitternesse ioyned with it, which maketh it the lesse pleasing and acceptable to most.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Licorice.</h4>

<p>Our English Licorice is now adaies of more familiar vse (as I said before)
then the outlandish, and is wholly spent and vsed to helpe to digest and expectorate
flegme out of the chest and lunges, and doth allay the sharpenesse
or saltnesse thereof. It is good also for those are troubled with shortnesse of
breath, and for all sorts of coughes. The iuice of Licorice artificially made
with Hyssope water, serueth very well for all the purposes aforesaid. It being
dissolued with Gum Tragacanth in Rose water, is an excellent Lohoc or
licking medicine to breake flegme, and to expectorate it, as also to avoyde
thin frothy matter, or thin salt flegme, which often fretteth the lungs. It
doth also lenisie exulcerated kidneyes, or the bladder, and helpeth to heale
them. It is held also good for those that cannot make their water but by
drops, or a small deale at a time.</p>

<p>The dryed root finely minced, is a speciall ingredient into all Trageas or
Dredges, seruing for the purposes aforesaid, but the vse of them is almost
wholly left now adaies with all sorts.</p>

amend the defects of many grounds.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a-orchard.jpg" alt="A">
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A<span class="looks_big">s</span> I haue done in the two former parts of this Treatise, so I
meane to proceede in this; first to set downe the situation of
an Orchard, and then other things in order: And first, I hold
that an Orchard which is, or should bee of some reasonable
large extent, should be so placed, that the house should haue
the Garden of flowers iust before it open vpon the South, and
the Kitchen Garden on the one side thereof, should also haue
the Orchard on the other side of the Garden of Pleasure, for
many good reasons: First, for that the fruit trees being grown
great and tall, will be a great shelter from the North and East windes, which may offend
your chiefest Garden, and although that your Orchard stand a little bleake vpon
the windes, yet trees rather endure these strong bitter blasts, then other smaller and
more tender shrubs and herbes can doe. Secondly, if your Orchard should stand behinde
your Garden of flowers more Southward, it would shadow too much of the
Garden, and besides, would so binde in the North and East, and North and West
windes vpon the Garden, that it would spoile many tender things therein, and so much
abate the edge of your pleasure thereof, that you would willingly wish to haue no
Orchard, rather then that it should so much annoy you by the so ill standing thereof.
Thirdly, the falling leaues being still blowne with the winde so aboundantly into
the garden, would either spoile many things, or haue one daily and continuall attending
thereon, to cleanse and sweepe them away. Or else to auoide these great inconueniences,
appoint out an Orchard the farther off, and set a greater distance of
ground betweene. For the ground or soile of the Orchard, what I haue spoken concerning
the former Garden for the bettering of the seuerall grounds, may very well
serue and be applyed to this purpose. But obserue this, that, whereas your Gardens before
spoken of may be turned vp, manured, and bettered with soile if they growe out
of heart, your Orchard is not so easily done, but must abide many yeares without altering;
and therefore if the ground be barren, or not good, it had the more neede to bee
amended, or wholly made good, before you make an Orchard of it; yet some there be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
that doe appoint, that where euery tree should bee set, you onely digge that place
to make it good: but you must know, that the rootes of trees runne further after
a little times standing, then the first compasse they are set in; and therefore a little
compasse of ground can maintaine them but a little while, and that when the rootes
are runne beyond that small compasse wherein they were first set, and that they are
come to the barren or bad ground, they can thriue no better then if they had beene set
in that ground at the first, and if you should afterwards digge beyond that compasse,
intending to make the ground better further off, you should much hurt the spreading
rootes, and put your trees in danger: the situation of hils in many places is grauelly
or chalky, which is not good for trees, because they are both too stonie, and lacke
mellow earth, wherein a tree doth most ioy and prosper, and want moisture also
(which is the life of all trees) because of the quicke descent of raine to the lower
grounds: and besides all these inconueniences there is one more; your trees planted
either on hils or hill sides, are more subiect to the fury and force of windes to be ouerturned,
then those that growe in the lower grounds; for the strongest and most forcible
windes come not vsually out of the North East parts, where you prouide best defence,
but from the South and West, whence you looke for the best comfort of the
Sunne. To helpe therefore manie of the inconueniences of the hils sides, it were fit
to cause manie leauels to bee made thereon, by raising the lower grounds with good
earth, and sustaining them with bricke or stone wals, which although chargeable, will
counteruaile your cost, beside the pleasure of the walkes, and prospect of so worthy
a worke. The plaine or leuell grounds as they are the most frequent, so they are the
most commendable for an Orchard, because the moulds or earths are more rich, or
may better and sooner be made so; and therefore the profits are the more may be raised
from them. A stiffe clay doth nourish trees well, by reason it containeth moisture;
but in regard of the coldnesse thereof, it killeth for the most part all tender and
early things therein: sea-cole ashes therefore, bucke ashes, streete soyle, chaulke after
it hath lyen abroad and been broken with many yeares frosts and raine, and sheepes
dung, are the most proper and fittest manure to helpe this kinde of soyle. The dry
sandy soile, and grauelly ground are on the contrary side as bad, by reason of too much
heate and lacke of moisture: the dung of kine or cattell in good quantity bestowed
thereon, will much helpe them. The amending or bettering of other sorts of grounds
is set down toward the end of the <a href="#Chap_1_I" title="go to Ordering Garden Chapter 1">first Chapter of the first part</a> of this worke, wherevnto
I will referre you, not willing to repeate againe the same things there set downe.
The best way to auoide and amend the inconueniences of high, boisterous, and cold
windes, is to plant Walnut trees, Elmes, Oakes or Ashes, a good distance without the
compasse of your Orchard, which after they are growne great, will bee a great safeguard
thereunto, by breaking the violence of the windes from it. And if the soyle of
your Orchard want moisture, the conueying of the sinke of the house, as also any other
draine of water thereinto, if it may be, will much helpe it.</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent cap">A<span class="looks_big">c</span>cording to the situation of mens grounds, so must the plantation of them of
necessitie be also; and if the ground be in forme, you shall haue a formall Orchard:
if otherwise, it can haue little grace or forme. And indeed in the elder
ages there was small care or heede taken for the formality; for euery tree for the most
part was planted without order, euen where the master or keeper found a vacant place
to plant them in, so that oftentimes the ill placing of trees without sufficient space betweene
them, and negligence in not looking to vphold them, procured more waste and
spoile of fruit, then any accident of winde or weather could doe. Orchards in most
places haue not bricke or stone wals to secure them, because the extent thereof being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
larger then of a Garden, would require more cost, which euery one cannot vndergoe;
and therefore mud wals, or at the best a quicke set hedge, is the ordinary and most vsuall
defence it findeth almost in all places: but with those that are of ability to compasse
it with bricke or stone wals, the gaining of ground, and profit of the fruit trees
planted there against, will in short time recompense that charge. If you make a doubt
how to be sure that your Orchard wall shall haue sufficient comfort of the Sunne to
ripen the fruits, in regard the trees in the Orchard being so nigh thereunto, and so
high withall, will so much shadow the wall, that nothing will ripen well, because it
will want the comfort of the Sunne: you may follow this rule and aduice, to remedy
those inconueniences. Hauing an Orchard containing one acre of ground, two, three,
or more, or lesse, walled about, you may so order it, by leauing a broad and large
walke betweene the wall and it, containing twenty or twenty foure foote (or yards if
you will) that the wall shall not be hindered of the Sun, but haue sufficient comfort for
your trees, notwithstanding the height of them, the distance betweene them and the
wall being a sufficient space for their shadow to fall into: and by compassing your Orchard
on the inside with a hedge
(wherein may bee planted all sorts
of low shrubs or bushes, as Roses,
Cornellian, Cherry trees plashed
lowe, Gooseberries, Curran trees,
or the like) you may enclose your
walke, and keepe both it and your
Orchard in better forme and manner,
then if it lay open. For the
placing of your trees in this Orchard,
first for the wals: Those
sides that lye open to the South &amp;
Southwest Sunne, are fittest to bee
planted with your tenderest and
earliest fruits, as Apricockes, Peaches,
Nectarius, and May or early
Cherries: the East, North and
West, for Plums and Quinces, as
you shall like best to place them.
And for the Orchard it selfe, the
ordinary manner is to place them
without regard of measure or difference,
as Peares among Apples,
and Plums among Cherries
promiscuously; but some keepe
both a distance and a diuision for
euery sort, without intermingling: yet the most gracefull Orchard containeth them
all, with some others, so as they be placed that one doe not hinder or spoile another;
and therefore to describe you the modell of an Orchard, both rare for comelinesse in
the proportion, and pleasing for the profitablenesse in the vse, and also durable for
continuance, regard this figure is here placed for your direction, where you must obserue,
that your trees are here set in such an equall distance one from another euery
way, &amp; as is fittest for them, that when they are grown great, the greater branches shall
not gall or rubbe one against another; for which purpose twenty or sixteene foot is the
least to be allowed for the distance euery way of your trees, &amp; being set in rowes euery
one in the middle distance, will be the most gracefull for the plantation, and besides,
giue you way sufficient to passe through them, to pruine, loppe, or dresse them, as need
shall require, and may also bee brought (if you please) to that gracefull delight, that
euery alley or distance may be formed like an arch, the branches of either side meeting
to be enterlaced together. Now for the seuerall sorts of fruit trees that you shall place
in this modell, your best direction is to set Damsons, Bulleis, and your taler growing
Plums on the outside, and your lower Plums, Cherries, and Apples on the inside, hauing
regard, that you place no Peare tree to the Sunward, or any other tree, lest it ouer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>shadow
them: Let your Peare trees therefore be placed behinde, or on the one side of
your lower trees, that they may be as it were a shelter or defence on the North &amp; East
side. Thus may you also plant Apples among Plums and Cherries, so as you suffer
not one to ouer-growe or ouer-toppe another; for by pruning, lopping, and shredding
those that growe too fast for their fellowes, you may still keepe your trees in such
a conformity, as may be both most comely for the sight, and most profitable for the
yeelding of greater and better store of fruit. Other sorts of fruit trees you may mixe
among these, if you please, as Filberds, Cornellian Cherries in standerds, and Medlers:
but Seruice trees, Baye trees, and others of that high sort, must be set to guard
the rest. Thus haue I giuen you the fairest forme could as yet be deuised; and from this
patterne, if you doe not follow it precisely, yet by it you may proportion your Orchard,
be it large or little, be it walled or hedged.</p>

<i class="sub-title">Of a noursery for trees, both from sowing the kernels, and planting
fit stockes to graft vpon.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">A<span class="looks_big">l</span>though I know the greater sort (I meane the Nobility and better part of the
Gentrie of this Land) doe not intend to keepe a Nursery, to raise vp those trees
that they meane to plant their wals or Orchards withall, but to buy them already
grafted to their hands of them that make their liuing of it: yet because many
Gentlemen and others are much delighted to bestowe their paines in grafting themselues,
and esteeme their owne labours and handie worke farre aboue other mens: for
their incouragement and satisfaction, I will here set downe some conuenient directions,
to enable them to raise an Orchard of all sorts of fruits quickly, both by sowing
the kernels or stones of fruit, and by making choise of the best sorts of stockes to graft
on: First therefore to begin with Cherries; If you will make a Nursery, wherein
you may bee stored with plenty of stockes in a little space, take what quantitie you
thinke good of ordinarie wilde blacke Cherrie stones, cleansed from the berries, and
sowe them, or pricke them in one by one on a peece of ground well turned vp, and
large enough for the quantitie of stones you will bestowe thereon, from the midst of
August vnto the end of September, which when they are two or three yeares old, according
to their growth, you may remoue them, and set them anew in some orderly
rowes, hauing pruned their tops and their rootes, which at the next yeares growth after
the new planting in any good ground, or at the second, will be of sufficient bignesse
to graft vpon in the bud what sorts of Cherries you thinke best: and it is fittest to
graft them thus young, that pruning your stockes to raise them high, you may graft
them at fiue or six foote high, or higher, or lower, as you shall see good, and being
thus grafted in the bud, will both more speedily and safely bring forward your grafts,
and with lesse danger of losing your stockes, then by grafting them in the stocke: for
if the bud take not by inoculating the first yeare, yet your tree is not lost, nor put in
any hazzard of losse; but may be grafted anew the yeare following, if you will, in an
other place thereof, whereas if you graft in the stocke, and it doe not take, it is a great
chance if the stocke dye not wholly, or at least be not so weakened both in strength and
height, that it will not bee fit to bee grafted a yeare or two after. In the same manner
as you doe with the blacke, you may deale with the ordinary English red Cherrie
stones, or kernels, but they are not so apt to growe so straight and high, nor in so short
a time as the blacke Cherrie stones are, and besides are subiect in time to bring out suckers
from the rootes, to the hinderance of the stockes and grafts, or at the least to the
deformitie of your Orchard, and more trouble to the Gardiner, to pull or digge them
away. Plumme stones may bee ordered in this manner likewise, but you must make
choise of your Plums; for although euery Plumme is not so fit for this purpose, as the
white Peare Plumme, because it groweth the goalest and freest, the barke being smooth
and aptest to be raised, that they may be grafted vpon; yet diuers other Plummes may
be taken, if they be not at hand, or to be had, as the blacke and red Peare Plumme, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
white and red Wheate Plumme, because they are nearest in goodnesse vnto it. Peach
stones will be soone raised vp to graft other sorts of Peaches or Nectorins vpon, but
the nature of the Peach roote being spongie, is not to abide long. As for Almonds,
they will be raised from their stones to be trees of themselues; but they will hardly abide
the remouing, and lesse to bee grafted vpon. Apricocke stones are the worst to
deale withall of any sort of stone fruit; for although the Apricocke branches are the
fittest stockes to graft Nectorins of the best sorts vpon, yet those that are raised from
the kernels or stones will neuer thriue to be brought on for this purpose; but will starue
and dye, or hardly grow in a long time to be a straight and fit stocke to be grafted, if it
be once remoued. Your Cornellian Cherrie trees are wholly, or for the most part raised
from the stones or kernels; yet I know diuers doe increase them, by laying in their
lowest branches to take roote: and thus much for stone fruits. Now for Apples and
Peares, to be dealt withall in the same manner as aforesaid. They vse to take the pressing
of Crabs whereas Veriuyce is made, as also of Cidar and Perry where they are
made, and sowing them, doe raise vp great store of stockes; for although the beating
of the fruit doth spoile many kernels, yet there will bee enough left that were neuer
toucht, and that will spring: the Crabbe stockes some preferre for the fittest, but I am
sure, that the better Apple and Peare kernels will growe fairer, straighter, quicklier,
and better to be grafted on. You must remember, that after two or three yeares you
take vp these stockes, and when you haue pruned both toppe and roote, to set them againe
in a thinner and fitter order, to be afterwards grafted in the bud while they are
young, as I shall shew you by and by, or in the stocke if you will suffer them to growe
greater. Now likewise to know which are the fittest stockes of all sorts to choose,
thereon to graft euery of these sorts of fruits, is a point of some skill indeede; and
therefore obserue them as I doe here set them downe: for bee you assured, that they
are certaine rules, and knowne experiences, whereunto you may trust without being
deceiued. Your blacke Cherrie stockes (as I said before) are the fittest and best for all
sorts of Cherries long to abide and prosper, and euen May or early Cherry will abide
or liue longer, being grafted thereon, either in the budde or in the stocke, then
on the ordinary red Cherry stocke; but the red Cherry stocke is in a manner the onely
tree that most Nursery men doe take to graft May Cherries on in the stocke (for it is
but a late experience of many, to graft May Cherries in the bud) many also doe graft
May Cherries on Gascoigne Cherry stockes, which doe not onely thriue well, but endure
longer then vpon any ordinary Cherry stocke: For indeede the May Cherries
that are grafted vpon ordinary red Cherrie stockes, will hardly hold aboue a dozen
yeares bearing well, although they come forwarder at the first, that is, doe beare sooner
then those that are grafted on Gascoigne or blacke Cherry stockes; but as they are
earlier in bearing, so they are sooner spent, and the Gascoigne and blacked Cherry
stockes that are longer in comming forward, will last twice or thrice their time; but
many more grafts will misse in grafting of these, then of those red Cherry stockes, and
besides, the natures of the Gascoigne and blacke Cherry stockes are to rise higher, and
make a goodlier tree then the ordinary red stocke will, which for the most part spreadeth
wide, but riseth not very high. The English red Cherry stocke will serue very
well to graft any other sort of Cherry vpon, and is vsed in most places of this Land,
and I know no other greater inconuenience in it, then that it shooteth out many suckers
from the roote, which yet by looking vnto may soone bee remoued from doing any
harme, and that it will not last so long as the Gascoigne or blacke Cherry stocke will.
May Cherries thus grafted lowe doe most vsually serue to be planted against a wall, to
bring on the fruit the earlier; yet some graft them high vpon standards, although not
many, and it is, I thinke, rather curiosity (if they that doe it haue any wals) then anie other
matter that causeth them thus to doe: for the fruit is naturally small, though early,
and the standard Cherries are alwaies later then the wall Cherries, so that if they can
spare any roome for them at their wals, they will not plant many in standards. Now
concerning Plummes (as I said before) for the sowing or setting of the stones, so I say
here for their choise in grafting of them, either in the budde or stocke. The white
Peare Plumme stocke, and the other there mentioned, but especially the white Peare
Plumme is the goodliest, freest and fittest of all the rest, as well to graft all sort of
Plummes vpon, as also to graft Apricockes, which can be handsomely, and to any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
good purpose grafted vpon no other Plum stocke, to rise to bee worth the labour and
paine. All sorts of Plums may be grafted in the stocke, and so may they also in the bud;
for I know none of them that will refuse to be grafted in the bud, if a cunning hand
performe it well, that is, to take off your bud cleanely and well, when you haue made
choice of a fit cyon: for, as I shal shew you anon, it is no small peece of cunning to chuse
your cyon that it may yeeld fit buds to graft withall, for euery plum is not of a like aptnes
to yeeld them: But Apricocks cannot be grafted in the stock for any thing that euer
I could heare or learne, but only in the bud, and therefore let your Plum stocke bee of
a reasonable size for Apricockes especially, and not too small, that the graft ouergrow
not the stocke, and that the stocke bee large enough to nourish the graft.
As your Plum stockes serue to graft both Apricockes and Plummes, so doe they serue
also very well to graft Peaches of all sorts; and although Peach stockes will serue to
be grafted with Peaches againe, yet the Peach stocke (as I said before) will not endure
so long as the Plumme stocke, and therefore serueth but for necessity if Plum stocks be
not ready, or at hand, or for the present time, or that they afterwards may graft that
sort of Peach on a Plumme stocke: for many might lose a good fruit, if when they
meete with it, and haue not Plumme stockes ready to graft it on, they could not be assured
that it would take vpon another Peach stocke or branch, or on the branch of
an Apricocke eyther. Plumme stockes will serue likewise very well for some sorts
of Nectorins; I say, for some sorts, and not for all: the greene and the yellow Nectorin
will best thriue to be grafted immediately on a Plumme stocke; but the other two
sorts of red Nectorins must not be immediately grafted on the Plumme stocke, but vpon
a branch of an Apricocke that hath beene formerly grafted on a Plumme stocke,
the nature of these Nectorins being found by experience to be so contrary to the Plum
stocke, that it will sterue it, and both dye within a yeare, two or three at the most: Diuers
haue tryed to graft these red Nectorins vpon Peach stockes, and they haue endured
well a while; but seeing the Peach stocke will not last long it selfe, being ouerweake,
how can it hold so strong a nature as these red Nectorins, which will (as I said
before) sterue a Plum stocke that is sufficient durable for any other Plumme?</p>

<p>Apricocke stockes from the stones are hardly nursed vp, and worse to be remoued,
and if a red Nectorin should be grafted on an Apricock raysed from the stone, and not
remoued, I doubt it might happen with it as it doth with many other trees raised from
stones or kernels, and not remoued, that they would hardly beare fruit: for the nature
of most trees raised from stones or kernels, and not remoued, is to send great downe-right
rootes, and not to spread many forwards; so that if they be not cut away that others
may spreade abroad, I haue seldome seene or known any of them to beare in any
reasonable time; and therefore in remouing, these great downe-right rootes are alwayes
shred away, and thereby made fit to shoote others forwards. Hereby you may
perceiue, that these red Nectorins will not abide to bee grafted vpon any other stocke
well, then vpon an Apricocke branch, although the green and the yellow (as I said before)
will well endure and thriue vpon Plums. The suckers or shootes both of Plums
and Cherries that rise from their rootes, eyther neare their stockes, or farther off, so
that they bee taken with some small rootes to them, will serue to bee stockes, and will
come forward quickly; but if the suckers haue no small roots whereby they may comprehend
in the ground, it is almost impossible it should hold or abide. There is another
way to rayse vp eyther stockes to graft on, or trees without grafting, which is, by circumcising
a faire and fit branch in this manner: About Midsomer, when the sappe is
thoroughly risen (or before if the yeare be forward) they vse to binde a good quantity
of clay round about a faire and straight branch, of a reasonable good size or bignesse,
with some conuenient bands, whether it be ropes of hey, or of any other thing, about
an handfull aboue the ioynt, where the branch spreadeth from the tree, and cutting the
barke thereof round about vnder the place where the clay is bound, the sap is hereby
hindered from rising, or descending further then that place so circumcised, whereby it
will shoote out small knubs and rootes into the clay, which they suffer so to abide vntill
the beginning of winter, whenas with a fine Sawe they cut off that branch where
it was circumcised, and afterwardes place it in the ground where they would haue it to
grow, and stake it, and binde it fast, which will shoote forth rootes, and will become
eyther a faire tree to beare fruite without grafting, or else a fit stocke to graft on accor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>ding
to the kinde: but oftentimes this kinde of propagation misseth, in that it sendeth
not forth rootes sufficient to cause it to abide any long time. Let me yet before I leaue
this narration of Plummes, giue you one admonition more, that vpon whatsoeuer
Plumme stocke you doe graft, yet vpon a Damson stocke that you neuer striue to graft,
for it (aboue all other sorts of Plumme stockes) will neuer giue you a tree worth your
labour. It remaineth only of stone fruit, that I speake of Cornelles, which as yet I neuer
saw grafted vpon any stocke, being as it should seeme vtterly repugnant to the nature
thereof, to abide grafting, but is wholly raysed vp (as I said before) eyther from
the stones, or from the suckers or layers. For Peares and Apples your vsuall stockes to
graft on are (as I said before, speaking of the nursing vp of trees from the kernels) your
Crabbe stockes, and they bee accepted in euery Countrey of this Land as they may
conueniently be had, yet many doe take the stockes of better fruit, whether they bee
suckers, or stockes raysed from the kernels (and the most common and knowne way
of grafting, is in the stocke for all sorts of them, although some doe vse whipping,
packing on, or incising, as euery one list to call it: but now we doe in many places begin
to deale with Peares and Apples as with other stone fruit, that is, graft them all in
the bud, which is found the most compendious and safest way both to preserue your
stocke from perishing, and to bring them the sooner to couer the stock, as also to make
the goodlier and straighter tree, being grafted at what height you please:) for those
stockes that are raysed from the kernels of good fruit (which are for the most part easily
knowne from others, in that they want those thornes or prickles the wilde kindes
are armed withall:) I say for the most part; for I know that the kernels of some good
fruite hath giuen stockes with prickles on them (which, as I thinke, was because that
good fruite was taken from a wilde stocke that had not beene long enough grafted to
alter his wilde nature; for the longer a tree is grafted, the more strength the fruite taketh
from the graft, and the lesse still from the stocke) being smoother and fairer then
the wilde kinds, must needes make a goodlier tree, and will not alter any whit the taste
of your fruit that is grafted thereon, but rather adde some better rellish thereunto; for
the Crabbe stockes yeelding harsh fruite, must giue part of their nature to the grafts are
set thereon, and therefore the taste or rellish, as well as some other naturall properties
of most fruits, are somewhat altered by the stocke. Another thing I would willingly
giue you to vnderstand concerning your fruits and stockes, that whereas diuers for curiosity
and to try experiments haue grafted Cherries vpon Plumme stockes, or Plums
on Cherry stockes, Apples vpon Peare stockes, and Peares vpon Apple stockes, some
of these haue held the graft a yeare, two or three peraduenture, but I neuer knew that
euer they held long, or to beare fruite, much lesse to abide or doe well: bestow not
therefore your paines and time on such contrary natures, vnlesse it be for curiositie, as
others haue done: Yet I know that they that graft peares on a white thorne stocke
haue had their grafts seeme to thriue well, and continue long, but I haue seldome seene
the fruite thereof answerable to the naturall wilde Peare stocke; yet the Medlar is
knowne to thriue best on a white thorne. And lastly, whereas diuers doe affirme that
they may haue not only good stockes to graft vpon, but also faire trees to bear store of
fruit from the kernels of Peares or Apples being prickt into the ground, and suffered
to grow without remouing, and then eyther grafted or suffered to grow into great trees
vngrafted; and for their bearing of fruite, assigne a dozen or twenty yeares from the
first setting of the kernels, and abiding vngrafted, I haue not seene or heard that experience
to hold certaine, or if it should be so, yet it is too long time lost, and too much
fruit also, to waite twenty yeares for that profit may be gained in a great deale of lesse
time, and with more certainty. Vnto these instructions let mee adde also one more,
which is not much known and vsed, and that is, to haue fruit within foure or fiue years
from the first sowing of your stones or kernels in this manner: After your stockes raysed from stones or
kernels are two or three yeares old, take the fairest toppe or branch, and graft it as you
would doe any other cyon taken from a bearing tree, and looke what rare fruite, eyther
Peare or Apple, the kernell was of that you sowed, or Peach or Plum <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> the stone was
set, such fruite shall you haue within two or three yeares at the most after the grafting,
if it take, and the stocke be good. And thus may you see fruit in farre lesse time then to
stay vntill the tree from a kernell or stone beareth fruit of it selfe.</p>

<i class="sub-title">The diuers manners of grafting all sorts of fruits
vsed in our Land.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e most vsuall manner of grafting in the stocke is so common and well known
in this Land to euery one that hath any thing to doe with trees or an Orchard,
that I think I shall take vpon mee a needlesse worke to set downe that is so well
knowne to most; yet how common soeuer it is, some directions may profit euery one,
without which it is not easily learned. And I doe not so much spend my time and
paines herein for their sakes that haue knowledge, but for such as not knowing would
faine be taught priuately, I meane, to reade the rules of the arte set downe in priuate,
when they would refuse to learne of a Gardiner, or other by sight: and yet I discommend
not that way vnto them to learne by sight; for one may see more in an instant by
sight, then he shall learn by his own practice in a great while, especially if he be a little
practised before he see a cunning hand to doe it. There are many other kindes of grafting,
which shall be spoken of hereafter, and peraduenture euen they that know it well,
may learne something they knew not before.</p>

<p>1. The grafting in the stocke, is, to set the sprigge of a good fruit into the body or
stocke of another tree, bee it wilde or other, bee it young or old, to cause that tree to
bring forth such fruit as the tree bore from whence you took the sprigge, and not such
as the stocke or tree would haue borne, if it had not beene grafted, and is performed in
this manner: Looke what tree or stocke you will chuse to graft on, you must with a
small fine sawe and very sharpe, whip off, or cut off the head or toppe thereof at what
height you eyther thinke best for your purpose, or conuenient for the tree: for if you
graft a great tree, you cannot without endangering the whole, cut it downe so low to
the ground, as you may without danger doe a small tree, or one that is of a reasonable
size; and yet the lower or neerer the ground you graft a young tree, the safer it is both
for your stocke and graft, because the sappe shall not ascend high, but soone giue vigour
to the graft to take and shoote quickly: After you haue cut off the toppe of your
stocke, cut or smooth the head thereof with a sharpe knife, that it may be as plaine and
smooth as you can, and then cleaue it with a hammer or mallet, and with a strong knife,
cleauer or chessell, either in the middle of it if it be small, or of a reasonable size, or on
the sides an inch or more within the barke, if it be great: into both sides of the cleft
put your grafts, or into one if the stocke bee smaller; which grafts must bee made
fit for the purpose on this fashion: Hauing made choise of your grafts from the toppe
branches especially, or from the sides of that tree whereof you would haue the fruit, and
that they be of a reasonable good size, not too small or too great for your stockes, and
of one or the same yeares shoote; (and yet many doe cut an inch or more of the olde
wood with the sprigge of the last yeares growth, and so graft the old and young together,
but both are good, and the old wood no better then the young) cut your graft not
too long, but with two, three or foure eyes or buds at the most, which at the lower or
bigger end for an inch long or more (for the greater stockes, and an inch or lesse for the
lesser sort) must be so cut, that it be very thin on the one side from the shoulders downward,
and thicker on the other, and thin also at the end, that it may goe downe close into
the cleft, and rest at the shoulders on the head of the stocke: but take heede that in
cutting your grafts your knife bee very sharpe that you doe not rayse any of the barke,
eyther at the sides or the end, for feare of losing both your paines and graft, and stocke
too peraduenture; and let not your grafts bee made long before you set them, or else
put the ends of them in water to keepe them fresh and cleane: when you set them you
must open the cleft of your stocke with a wedge or chessell as most doe, that the graft
may goe easily into it, and that the barke of both graft and stocke may ioyne close the
one to the other, which without stirring or displacing must bee so left in the cleft, and
the wedge or chessell gently pulled forth; but because in the doing hereof consisteth
in a manner the whole losse or gaine of your paines, graft and stocke, to preuent which
inconuenience I doe vse an iron Instrument, the forme whereof is showne in the fol<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>lowing
page, marked with the letter A, crooked at both ends, and broade like vnto a
chessell, the one bigger, and the other lesser, to fit all sorts of stockes, and the iron handle
somewhat long betweene them both, that being thrust or knocked downe into the
cleft, you may with your left hand open it as wide as is fit to let in your graft, without
strayning, which being placed, this iron may bee pulled or knocked vp againe without
any mouing of your graft: when you haue thus done, you must lay a good handfull
or more (according to the bignesse of your stocke) of soft and well moistned clay
or loame, well tempered together with short cut hey or horse dung, vpon the head of
your stocke, as lowe or somewhat lower then the cleft, to keepe out all winde, raine or
ayre from your graft vntill Midsomer at the least, that the graft be shot forth somewhat
strongly, which then if you please may be remoued, and the cleft at the head only filled
with a little clay to keepe out earewigs, or other things that may hurt your graft.</p>

</div>

<p>2. Inarching is another manner of grafting in the stocke, and is more troublesome,
and more casuall also then the former, and is rather a curiosity then any way of good
speede, certainety or profit, and therefore vsed but of a few. Yet to shew you, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
manner thereof, it is thus: Hauing a tree well growne, bee it high or low, yet the lower
the better, with young branches well spread, they vse to set stockes round about it, or
on the one side as you please; into which stockes they ingraft the young branches of
the well growne tree as they are growing (before they cut them from the tree) by bowing
downe the branch they intend to graft, and putting it into the stocke, hauing first
cut off the head thereof, and cut a notch in the middle of the head a little slope on
both sides, wherein the branch must be fitted: let the branch be cut thinne on the vnderside,
only of that length as may suffice to fit the notch in the stocke, leauing about
halfe a yarde length of the branch, to rise aboue or beyond the stocke, which beeing
bound on, and clayed ouer or couered with red or greene soft waxe, they let so abide,
that if it take in the stocke they cut off the branch a little below the grafting place in
Nouember following, and remouing the stocke, they haue thus gained a grafted and
growne tree the first yeare: but it is vsually seene, that where one branch taketh, three
doe misse: yet this manner of grafting was much in vse for May Cherries, when they
were first known to vs, and the way thought to be a rare manner of grafting to encrease
them, vntill a better way was found out, which now is so common and good also, that
this is not now scarce thought vpon.</p>

<p>3. Another kinde of grafting in the stocke is called of some whipping, of some
splicing, of others incising, and of others packing on (and as I heare, is much vsed in
the West parts especially, and also in the North parts of this Land) and is performed
in this manner: Take and slice the branch of a tree (so as the branch be not too bigge)
or else a young tree of two, or three, or foure yeares growth at the most, quite off slope
wise, about an inch and a halfe long or more, and cut a deep notch in the middle thereof,
then fit into it a graft iust of that size or bignesse, cut on both sides with shoulders,
and thin at the end, that it may ioyne close in the notch, and neyther bigger or lesser,
but that the barke of the one may bee fitted iust to the barke of the other, the figure
wherof is expressed at the letters E.F. which shew the one to be with a shoulder &amp; the
other without; binde them gently together with bast, and put clay or waxe ouer the
place, vntill it be taken: this is much vsed of late dayes for such young trees as are risen
of stones or kernels after the second or third yeares growth, and thriue very well
in that it not only saueth much time, but diuers checks by remouing and grafting.</p>

<p>4. Inoculating or grafting in the budde is another manner of grafting, which is the
taking of a budde from one tree, and putting it into the barke of another tree, to the
end, that thereby you may haue of the same kinde of fruit the tree bare from whence
the budde was taken; and although it bee sufficiently knowne in many places of this
Land, yet as I vnderstand, good Gardiners in the North parts, and likewise in some other
places, can scarce tell what it meaneth, or at the least how to doe it well. It is performed
after a different fashion from the former, although they all tend vnto one end,
which is the propagating of trees. You must for this purpose obserue, that for those
trees you would graft, either with, or vpon, you choose a fit time in Summer, when
the sappe is well risen, and your graft well shot, that the barke will rise easily and
cleanly, both of stocke and graft, which time I cannot appoint, because both the years
doe differ in earlinesse, and the seuerall parts or countries of this Land likewise one
from another, but most vsually in these Southerne parts, from the beginning of Iune
vnto the end of it, or to the middle of Iuly, or either somewhat before or after. First
(as I said) hauing taken the fitted time of the yeare, you must take especiall care, that
your grafts be well growne, and of the same yeares shoote, and also that the buds or
eyes haue but single leaues at them, as neere as you can: for I would vtterly refuse
those buds that haue aboue two leaues as vnprofitable, either in Peaches or any other
fruit; and therefore see that your grafts or cyons bee taken from the chiefest place of
the tree, that is, either from the toppe, or from a sunnie side thereof, and not from the
contrarie side if you may otherwise, nor from any vnder-boughes; for seeing your
graft is so small a thing, you had neede take the more care that it be the best and fairest.
You must to take off this eye or budde from the sprigge, haue a small sharpe pen-knife,
the end of the haft being made flat and thinne, like a chessell or wedge, the figure
whereof is set forth at the letter B, and a pen or goose quill cut, to be lesse then halfe
round, and to be broad at the end, but not sharpe pointed like a penne, or else such a
peece of bone or Iuorie made in that fashion as the quill is, to bee thinne, hollow, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
halfe round, the figures of both which are marked with the letters C, D, with your
knife cut the barke of the bud (hauing first cut off the leafe, leauing onely the short
foote-stalke thereof at the bud) about a strawes breadth aboue the eye thereof halfe
round, and then from that round or ouerthwart cut, with your knife cut it downe on
both sides of the eye, close to the bud slopewise about an inch long or thereabouts,
that it bee broad at the head aboue the eye, and pointing at the end like a sheild or
scutcheon; and then cutting away the rest of the barke from about it, with the thinne
flat end of the haft of your knife raise vp both sides of your bud a little, and with your
quill or bone put vnder the barke, raise your budde, and thrust it quite off, beginning
at the toppe or head of your eye; but see that you thrust it off close to the wood of the
branch or sprigge, and that you doe not leaue the eye of the budde behinde sticking
vpon the branch; for if that eye be left or lost, your bud is worth nothing; you must
cast it away, and cut another that may haue that eye abiding within the budde on the
inside: you may perceiue if that eye be wanting, if you see an emptie hole in the place
where the eye should be, to fill it vp on the inside thereof; thus hauing taken off your
bud well and cleanly, which is set forth vnto you at the figures, 3 and 4. presently set it
on the tree you would graft (for your small budde can abide no delay, lest by taking the
ayre too long it become dry, and nothing worth) in this manner: Cut the barke of
your tree you would graft in a smooth place, at what height you please, first aboue or
ouerthwart, and then downe right in the middle thereof, more then an inch long, the
figure whereof you shall haue at the figure 1. and then raise vp both sides of the barke,
first one, and then another, with the flat and thinne haft end of your knife, a prettie
way inwards (for if the barke will not rise easily, the stocke is not then fit to graft vpon)
put in your budde into the cleft with the point downewards, holding the stalke of
the leafe that is with the budde betweene your fingers of the one hand, and opening
the cleft with the flat end of your knife with the other hand, that the head of your
bud may be put close vnder the ouerthwart cut in the stocke or tree (which must not be
raised or stirred as the sides are) &amp; the eye of the bud stand iust in the middle of the slit
that is downeright, and then closing the barke of the stocke or tree softly vnto the bud
thus put in with your fingers, let it be bound gently with a small long peece of baste,
or other such like soft thing, first aboue the eye, &amp; then compassing it belowe as close as
you can, but not too hard in any case, vntil you haue bound it all ouer the slit you made,
especially the lower end, lest any winde get in to dry and spoile it; and hauing tyed
both ends thereof fast, leaue it so for a fortnight or somewhat more, in which space it
will take and hold, if it be well done, which you shall perceiue, if the bud abide green,
and turne not blacke, when you haue vnloosed the tying; for if it hold fast to the tree,
and be fresh and good, tye it vp gently againe, and so leaue it for a fortnight longer,
or a moneth if you will, and then you may take away your binding cleane: this budde
will (if no other mischance happen vnto it) spring and shoote forth the next yeare,
(and sometimes the same yeare, but that is seldome) and therefore in the beginning of
the yeare, cut off the head of the grafted tree about an handfull aboue the grafted
place, vntill the graft be growne strong, and then cut it off close, that the head may be
couered with the graft, and doe not suffer any buds to sprout besides the graft, either
aboue or belowe it. If you graft diuers buds vpon one stocke (which is the best way)
let that onely remaine and abide that shooteth best forth, and rubbe off, or take away
the other: the seuerall parts of this grafting I haue caused to be expressed for your further
information.</p>

<p>5. Grafting in the scutcheon is accounted another kinde of grafting, and differeth
verie little from grafting in the budde: the difference chiefly consisteth in this, that in
stead of the downe right slit, and that aboue ouerthwart, they take away iust so much
barke of the great tree, as your budde is in bignesse, which vsually is a little larger then
the former, and placing it therein, they binde it as formerly is said: some vse for this
purpose a paire of compasses, to giue the true measure both of bud and stocke; this
manner of grafting is most vsed vpon greater trees, whose young branches are too
high to graft vpon in the former maner, and whose tops they cut off (for the most part)
at the latter end of the next yeare after the bud is taken: both these waies were inuented
to saue the losse of trees, which are more endangered by grafting in the stocke,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
then any of these waies; and besides, by these waies you may graft at a farre greater
height without losse.</p>

<i class="sub-title">Of the manner of grafting and propagating all
sorts of Roses.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">H<span class="looks_big">a</span>uing now spoken of the grafting of trees, let mee adioyne the properties of
Roses, which although they better fit a Garden then an Orchard, yet I could
not in a fitter place expresse them then here, both for the name and affinity of
grafting, &amp; because I do not expresse it in the first part. All sorts of Roses may be grafted
(although all sorts are not, some seruing rather for stockes for others to be grafted
on) as easily as any other tree, &amp; is only performed, by inoculating in the same maner I
haue set downe in the <a href="#Chap_5_IIII" title="go to Ordering of the Orchard chapter 4">former Chapter</a> of grafting trees in the bud; for both stocke and
budde must bee dealt with after the same fashion. And although some haue boasted of
grafting Roses by dicing or whipping, as they call it, or in the stocke, after the first
manner, set downe in the former Chapter, yet I thinke it rather a bragge, not hauing
seene or heard any true effect proceede from that relation. The sweete Briar or Eglantine,
the white and the Damaske Roses, are the chiefest stockes to graft vpon. And if
you graft lowe or neare the ground, you may by laying downe that graft within the
ground, after it hath bin shot out well, and of a years growth, by pinning it fast downe
with short stickes, a thwart or acrosse, cause that grafted branch, by taking roote, to
become a naturall Rose, such as the graft was, which being separated and transplanted
after it hath taken root wel, will prosper as well as any naturall sucker. And in this maner,
by laying downe branches at length into the ground, if they be full of spreading
small branches, you may increase all sorts of Roses quickly and plentifully; for they
will shoote forth rootes at the ioynts of euery branch: But as for the manner of grafting
white Roses or Damaske vpon Broome stalkes or Barbary bushes, to cause them to
bring forth double yellow Roses, or vpon a Willowe, to beare greene Roses, they
are all idle conceits, as impossible to be effected, as other things, whereof I haue spoken
in the <a href="#Chap_1_IX" title="go to Ordering chapter 9">ninth Chapter of my first part</a>, concerning a Garden of flowers, vnto which
I referre you to be satisfied with the reasons there alledged. And it is the more needlesse,
because we haue a naturall double yellow Rose of it owne growing. The sowing
of the seedes of Roses (which are sometimes found vpon most sorts of Roses, although
not euery yeare, and in euerie place) hath bin formerly much vsed; but now the laying
downe of the young shootes is a way for increase so much vsed, being safe and verie
speedie to take, especially for those Roses that are not so apt to giue suckers, that it
hath almost taken quite away the vse of sowing of the seedes of Roses, which yet if
anie one be disposed to make the triall, they must gather the seede out of the round
heads, from amongst the doune, wherein they lye verie like vnto the berries of the
Eglantine or sweete Briar bush, and especially of those Roses that bee of the more single
kindes, which are more apt to giue berries for seed then the more double, although
sometimes the double Roses yeeld the like heads or berries. Their time of sowing is
in the end of September (yet some reserue them vntill February) and their manner
of noursing is to bee transplanted, after the first or second yeares growth, and tended
carefully, that while they are young they be not lost for want of moisture in the
dry time of Summer.</p>

<i class="sub-title">Certaine rules and obseruations in and after grafting, not
remembred in the former Chapter.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e time of some manners of grafting being not mentioned before, must here
be spoken of. For the grafting of all sorts of trees in the stocke, the most vsuall
time is from the middle of February vntill the middle of March, as the yeare
and the countrie is more forward or backward, with vs about London wee neuer passe
midde March: but because the May Cherrie is first ripe, and therefore of a very forward
nature, it doth require to be grafted somewhat sooner then others. The time of
gathering likewise, or cutting your grafts for grafting in the stocke, is to be obserued,
that they bee not long gathered before they bee grafted, for feare of being too dry,
which I commend, howsoeuer diuers say, if they be long kept they are not the worse;
and therefore if you be forced to haue your grafts from farre, or by some other chance
to keepe them long, be carefull to keepe them moist, by keeping their ends stucke in
moist clay; but if neare hand, neglect no time I say after the cutting of them for their
grafting, but either the same, or the next day, or verie speedily after, in the meane time
being put into the ground to keepe them fresh. The grafts taken from old trees, because
they are stronger, and shoote forth sooner, are to bee sooner grafted then those
that are taken from younger trees: of a good branch may bee made two, and sometimes
three grafts sufficient for anie reasonable stocke. For whipping, the time is
somewhat later then grafting in the stocke, because it is performed on younger trees,
which (as I said before) doe not so early bud or shoote forth as the elder. Inarching
likewise is performed much about the later end of the grafting time in the stocke; for
being both kindes thereof they require the same time of the yeare. The times of the
other manners of graftings are before expressed, to bee when they haue shot forth
young branches, from whence your buds must be taken; and therefore need not here
againe to be repeated. If a graft in the stocke doth happen not to shoote forth when others
do (so as it holdeth green) it may perchance shoot out a moneth or two after, &amp; do
well, or else after Midsummer, when a second time of shooting, or the after Spring appeareth:
but haue an especiall care, that you take not such a graft that shal haue nothing
but buds for flowers vpon it, and not an eye or bud for leaues (which you must be carefull
to distinguish) for such a graft after it hath shot out the flowers must of necessitie
dye, not hauing wherewith to maintaine it selfe. Also if your good graft doe misse, and
not take, it doth hazzard your stocke at the first time, yet manie stockes doe recouer to
be grafted the second time; but twice to faile is deadly, which is not so in the inoculating
of buds in the greene tree: for if you faile there in three, or three times three, yet
euerie wound being small, and the tree still growing greene, will quickly recouer it,
and not be afterwards seen. Some vse to graft in the stocke the same yeare they remoue
the stocke, to saue time, &amp; a second checke by grafting; but I like better both in grafting
in the stocke, and in the bud also, that your trees might be planted in the places where
you would haue them growe, for a yeare or two at the least before you graft them, that
after grafting there should be no remouall, I neede not be tedious, nor yet I hope verie
sollicitous to remember many other triuiall, or at the least common knowne things
in this matter. First, for the time to remoue trees, young or old, grafted or vngrafted,
to be from a fortnight after Michaelmas vntill Candlemas, or if neede be, somewhat
after, yet the sooner your remoue is, the better your trees will thriue, except it be in a
very moist ground. For the manner or way to set them: <i>viz.</i> in the high and dry
grounds set them deeper, both to haue the more moisture, and to be the better defended
from windes; and in the lower and moister grounds Shallower, and that the earth
be mellow, well turned vp, and that the finer earth bee put among the small rootes,
wherein they may spread, and afterwards gently troden downe, that no hollownesse
remaine among the rootes: as also that after setting (if the time be not ouermoist) there
may be some water powred to the rootes, to moisten and fasten them the better; and
in the dry time of Summer, after the setting, let them not want moisture, if you will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
haue them thriue and prosper; for the want thereof at that time, hath often killed manie
a likely tree. To stake and fence them also if neede bee after they are new set,
and so to continue for two or three yeares after, is verie expedient, lest windes or other
casualties spoile your paines, and ouerthrow your hopes. And likewise to defend
your grafts from birds lighting on them, to breake or displace them, to sticke some
prickes or sharpe pointed stickes longer then your graft into your clay, that so they
may be a sure defence of it: As also to tye some woollen cloathes about the lower end
of your stockes, or thrust in some thornes into the ground about the rootes, to defend
them from hauing their barkes eaten by Conies, or hurt by some other noisome vermine.</p>

<i class="sub-title">Obseruations for the dressing and well keeping of Trees and an
Orchard in good order.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are two manner of waies to dresse and keepe trees in good order, that
they may bee both gracefull and fruitfull; the one is for wall-trees, the other
is for standards: for as their formes are different, so is their keeping or
ordering. Wall trees, because they are grafted lowe, and that their branches must
be plasht or tackt vnto the wall to fasten them, are to be so kept, that all their branches
may be suffered to growe, that shoote forth on either side of the bodie, and led either
along the wall, or vpright, and one to lappe ouer or vnder another as is conuenient,
and still with peeces of lists, parings of felt, peeces of soft leather, or other such like
soft thing compassing the armes or branches, fastened with small or great nailes, as
neede requireth, to the wals, onely those buds or branches are to be nipped or cut off,
that shoot forward, and will not so handsomely be brought into conformity, as is fitting;
yet if the branches growe too thicke, to hinder the good of the rest, or too high
for the wall, they may, nay they must be cut away or lopped off: and if anie dead
branches also happen to be on the trees, they must be cut away, that the rest may haue
the more libertie to thriue. Diuers also by carefully nipping away the waste and superfluous
buds, doe keepe their trees in conformity, without much cutting. The time
to pruine or plash, or tye vp wall trees, is vsually from the fall of the leafe, to the beginning
of the yeare, when they begin to blossome, and most especially a little before
or after Christmas: but in any case not too late, for feare of rubbing off their buds.
Some I know doe plash and tye vp their wall trees after bearing time, while the leaues
are greene, and their reason is, the buds are not so easie or apt to bee rubbed from the
branches at that time, as at Christmas, when they are more growne: but the leaues
must needes be very cumbersome, to hinder much both the orderly placing, and close
fastening of them to the wall. This labour you must performe euery yeare in its due
time; for if you shall neglect and ouerslip it, you shall haue much more trouble, to
bring them into a fit order againe, then at the first. The standard trees in an Orchard
must be kept in another order; for whereas the former are suffered to spread at large,
these must be pruined both from superfluous branches that ouerload the trees, &amp; make
them lesse fruitfull, as well as lesse sightly, and the vnder or water boughes likewise,
that drawe much nourishment from the trees and yet themselues little the better for
it, I meane to giue fruit. If therefore your Orchard consist of young trees, with a little
care and paines it may bee kept in that comely order and proportion it was first defined
vnto; but if it consist of old growne trees, they will not without a great deale
of care and paines be brought into such conformitie, as is befitting good, and comely
trees: for the marke of those boughes or branches that are cut off from young trees,
will quickly be healed againe, the barke growing quickly ouer them, whereby they
are not worse for the cutting, but an old tree if you cut off a bough, you must cut it
close and cleanly, and lay a searcloth of tallow, waxe, and a little pitch melted together
vpon the place, to keepe off both the winde, sunne, and raine, untill the barke
haue couered it ouer againe: and in this manner you must deale with all such short
stumps of branches, as are either broken short off with the winde, or by carelesnesse or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
want of skill, or else such armes or branches as are broken off close, or sliued from the
body of the tree: for the raine beating and falling into such a place, will in short time
rotte your tree, or put it in danger, besides the deformity. Some vse to fill vp such an
hole with well tempered clay, and tacke a cloth or a peece of leather ouer it vntill it be
recouered, and this is also not amisse. Your young trees, if they stand in anie good
ground, will bee plentifull enough in shooting forth branches; bee carefull therefore
if they growe too thicke, that you pruine away such as growe too close (and will, if
they be suffered, spoile one another) as they may be best spared, that so the sunne, ayre,
and raine may haue free accesse to all your branches, which will make them beare the
more plentifully, and ripen them the sooner and the more kindly. If anie boughes
growe at the toppe too high, cut them also away, that your trees may rather spread
then growe too high. And so likewise for the vnder boughes, or anie other that by
the weight of fruit fall or hang downe, cut them off at the halfe, and they will afterwards
rise and shoote vpwards. You shall obserue, that at all those places where anie
branches haue been cut away, the sappe will euer bee readie to put forth: if therefore
you would haue no more branches rise from that place, rubbe off or nippe off such
buddes as are not to your minde when they are new shot: and thus you may keep your
trees in good order with a little paines, after you haue thus pruined and dressed them.
One other thing I would aduertise you of, and that is how to preserue a fainting or decaying
tree which is readie to perish, if it be not gone too farre or past cure, take a good
quantitie of oxe or horse bloud, mixe therewith a reasonable quantitie of sheepe or pigeons
dung, which being laid to the roote, will by the often raines and much watering
recouer it selfe, if there bee anie possibilitie; but this must bee done in Ianuarie or Februarie
at the furthest.</p>

<i class="sub-title">Diuers other obseruations to be remembred in the well
keeping of an Orchard.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere be diuers other things to be mentioned, whereof care must be had, either
to doe or auoide, which I thinke fit in this Chapter promiscuously to set down,
that there may be nothing wanting to furnish you with sufficient knowledge of
the care, paines, and casualties that befall an Orchard: for it hath many enemies, and
euery one laboureth as much as in them lye, to spoile you of your pleasure, or profit, or
both, which must bee both speedily and carefully preuented and helped; and they are
these: Mosse, Caterpillars, Ants, Earwigs, Snailes, Moales, and Birds. If Mosse begin
to ouergrowe your trees, looke to it betimes, lest it make your trees barren: Some vse to
hacke, and crossehacke, or cut the barke of the bodies of their trees, to cause it fall away;
but I feare it may endanger your trees. Others do either rubbe it off with a haire cloth,
or with a long peece of wood formed like a knife, at the end of a long sticke or pole,
which if it bee vsed cauteiously without hurting the buds, I like better. Caterpillars,
some smoake them with burning wet strawe or hay, or such like stuffe vnder the trees;
but I doe not greatly like of that way: others cut off the boughes whereon they breed,
and tread them vnder their feete, but that will spoile too manie branches; and some
kill them with their hands, but some doe vse a new deuised way, that is, a pompe made
of lattin or tin, spout-fashion, which being set in a tubbe of water vnder or neare your
trees, they will cause the water to rise through it with such a force, and through the
branches, that it will wash them off quickly. To destroy Ants, that eate your fruit before
and when it is ripe, some vse to annoint the bodies of their trees with tarre, that
they may not creepe vp on the branches; but if that doe not helpe, or you will not vse
it, you must be careful to finde out their hill, and turne it vp, pouring in scalding water,
either in Summer, but especially if you can in Winter, and that will surely destroy
them. I haue spoken of Earwigs in the first part of this worke, entreating of the annoyances
of Gilloflowers, and therefore I referre you thereunto: yet one way more I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
will here relate which some doe vse, and that is with hollow canes of halfe a yard
long or more, open at both ends for them to creepe in, and stucke or laid among the
branches of your trees, will soone drawe into them many Earwigs, which you may
soone kill, by knocking the cane a little vpon the ground, and treading on them with
your foote. Snailes must be taken with your hands, and that euerie day, especially in
the morning when they will be creeping abroad. Moales by running vnder your trees
make them lesse fruitfull, and also put them in danger to be blowne downe, by leauing
the ground hollow, that thereby the rootes haue not that strength in the ground, both
to shoote and to hold, that otherwise they might haue. Some haue vsed to put Garlicke,
and other such like things into their holes, thinking thereby to driue them away,
but to no purpose: others haue tryed manie other waies; but no way doth auaile anie
thing, but killing them either with a Moale spade, or a trappe made for the purpose as
manie doe know: and they must bee watched at their principall hill, and trenched
round, and so to be caught. Birds are another enemie both to your trees and fruit;
for the Bullfinch will destroy all your stone fruit in the budde, before they flower, if
you suffer them, and Crowes, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> when your Cherries are ripe: for the smaller birds,
Lime twigs set either neare your trees, or at the next water where they drinke, will
helpe to catch them and destroy them. And for the greater birds, a stone bowe, a
birding or fowling peece will helpe to lessen their number, and make the rest more
quiet: or a mill with a clacke to scarre them away, vntill your fruit be gathered. Some
other annoyances there are, as suckers that rise from the rootes of your trees, which
must be taken away euerie yeare, and not suffered to growe anie thing great, for feare
of robbing your trees of their liuelihood. Barke bound, is when a tree doth not shoote
and increase, by reason the barke is as it were drie, and will not suffer the sappe to
passe vnto the branches: take a knife therefore, and slit the barke downe almost
all the length of the tree in two or three places, and it will remedy that euill, and
the tree will thriue and come forward the better after. Barke pilled is another euill
that happeneth to some trees, as well young as old, either by reason of casuall hurts,
or by the gnawing of beasts, howsoeuer it bee, if it bee anie great hurt, lay a plaister
thereon made of tallow, tarre, and a little pitch, and binde it thereto, letting it
so abide vntill the wound bee healed: yet some doe only apply a little clay or loame
bound on with ropes of hay. The Canker is a shrewd disease when it happeneth to a
tree; for it will eate the barke round, and so kill the very heart in a little space. It must
be looked vnto in time before it hath runne too farre; most men doe wholly cut away
as much as is fretted with the Canker, and then dresse it, or wet it with vinegar or
Cowes pisse, or Cowes dung and vrine, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> vntill it be destroyed, and after healed
againe with your salue before appointed. There are yet some other enemies to an Orchard:
for if your fence be not of bricke or stone, but either a mudde wall, or a quicke
set or dead hedge, then looke to it the more carefully, and preuent the comming in of
either horse, or kine, sheepe, goates, or deere, hare, or conie; for some of them will
breake through or ouer to barke your trees, and the least hole almost in the hedge will
giue admittance to hares and conies to doe the like. To preuent all which, your care
must be continuall to watch them or auoide them, and to stoppe vp their entrance. A
dogge is a good seruant for many such purposes, and so is a stone bowe, and a peece to
make vse of as occasion shall serue. But if you will take that medicine for a Canker
spoken of before, which is Cowes dung and vrine mixed together, and with a brush
wash your trees often to a reasonable height, will keepe hares and conies from eating
or barking your trees. Great and cold windes doe often make a great spoile in an Orchard,
but great trees planted without the compasse thereof, as Wall-nuts, Oakes,
Elmes, Ashes, and the like, will stand it in great stead, to defend it both early and late.
Thus haue I shewed you most of the euils that may happen to an Orchard, and the
meanes to helpe them, and because the number is great and daily growing, the care
and paines must be continuall, the more earnest and diligent, lest you lose that in a
moment that hath been growing many yeares, or at the least the profit or beauty of
some yeares fruit.</p>

<i class="sub-title">The manner and way how to plant, order, and keepe other trees that
beare greene leaues continually.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e way to order those trees that beare their leaues greene continually, is differing
from all others that doe not so: for neyther are they to bee planted or
remoued at the time that all other trees are set, nor doe they require that manner
of dressing, pruining and keeping, that others doe. And although many ignorant
persons and Gardiners doe remoue Bay trees, and are so likewise perswaded that all
other trees of that nature, that is, that carry their greene leaues continually, may
bee remoued in Autumne or Winter, as well as all other trees may bee, yet it
is certaine it is a great chance if they doe thriue and prosper that are set at that
time, or rather it is found by experience, that scarce one of ten prospereth well that
are so ordered. Now in regard that there be diuers trees and shrubs mentioned here in
this booke that beare euer greene leaues, wherein there is very great beauty, and many
take pleasure in them; as the ordinary Bay, the Rose Bay, and the Cherry Bay trees,
the Indian Figge, the Cypresse, the Pine tree, the Mirtle and dwarfe Boxe, and many
others; I will here shew you how to plant and order them, as is fittest for them. For
in that they doe not shed their greene leaues in winter as other trees doe, you may in
reason be perswaded that they are of another nature; and so they are indeede: for seeing
they all grow naturally in warme Countries, and are from thence brought vnto vs,
we must both plant them in a warmer place, and transplant them in a warmer time then
other trees be, or else it is a great hazzard if they doe not perish and dye, the cold and
frosts in the winter being able to pierce them through, if they should bee transplanted
in winter, before they haue taken roote. You must obserue and take this therefore for
a certaine rule, that you alwaies remoue such trees or shrubbes as are euer greene in the
spring of the yeare, and at no time else if you will doe well, that is, from the end of
March, or beginning of Aprill, vnto the middle or end of May, especially your more
dainty and tender plants, shadowing them also for a while from the heate of the Sun,
and giuing them a little water vpon their planting or transplanting; but such water as
hath not perfectly been drawn from a Well or Pumpe, for that will go neer to kill any
plant, but such water as hath stood in the open ayre for a day at the least, if not two or
three. Yet for dwarfe Boxe I confesse it may endure one moneth to be earlier planted
then the rest, because it is both a more hardy and lowe plant, and thereby not so much
subiect to the extremitie of the colde: but if you should plant it before winter, the
frosts would raise it out of the ground, because it cannot so soone at that time of the
yeare take roote, and thereby put it in danger to be lost. Moreouer all of them will
not abide the extremitie of our winter frosts, and therefore you must of necessity house
some of them, as the Rose Bay, Mirtle, and some others, but the other sorts being set
where they may bee somewhat defended from the cold windes, frostes, and snow in
winter, with some couering or shelter for the time, will reasonably well endure and
beare their fruit, or the most of them. If any be desirous to be furnished with store of
these kinds of trees that will be noursed vp in our Country, he may by sowing the seed
of them in square or long woodden boxes or chests made for that purpose, gaine plenty
of them: but hee must be carefull to couer them in winter with some straw or fearne,
or beane hame, or such like thing layd vpon crosse sticks to beare it vp from the plants,
and after two or three yeares that they are growne somewhat great and strong, they
may bee transplanted into such places you meane they shall abide: yet it is not amisse
to defend them the first yeare after they are transplanted, for their more securitie: the
seedes that are most vsually sowen with vs, are, the Cypresse tree, the Pine tree, the
Baye, the Pyracantha or prickly Corall tree, and the Mirtle: the Rose Bay I haue had
also risen from the seede that was fresh, and brought me from Spaine. But as for Orenge
trees, because they are so hardly preserued in this our cold climate (vnlesse it bee with
some that doe bestow the housing of them, besides a great deale more of care and respect
vnto them) from the bitternesse of our cold long winter weather (although their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
kernels being put into the ground in the Spring or Summer, and if care bee had of
them and conuenient keeping, will abide, and by grafting the good fruite on the crab
stocke they may bee in time nursed vp) I doe not make any other especiall account of
them, nor giue you any further relation of their ordering. Now for the ordering of
these trees after they are eyther planted of young sets, or transplanted from the seede,
it is thus: First for Bay trees, the most vsuall way is to let them grow vp high to bee
trees, and many plant them on the North or East side of their houses that they may not
bee scorched with the Sunne; but the bitter winters which we often haue, doe pinch
them shrewdly, insomuch that it killeth euen well growne trees sometimes downe to
the roote: but some doe make a hedge of them being planted in order, and keep them
low by lopping of them continually, which will make them bush and spread. The Cypresse
tree is neuer lopped, but suffered to grow with all the branches from a foote aboue
the ground, if it may be, straight vpright; for that is his natiue grace and greatest
beautie, and therefore the more branches doe dye that they must bee cut away, the
more you deforme his propertie. The Pine tree may be vsed in the same manner, but
yet it wil better endure to sustaine pruining then the Cypresse, without any such deformitie.
The Laurocerasus or Cherry Bay may be diuersly formed, that is, it may be either
made to grow into a tall tree by shredding still away the vnder branches, or else
by suffering all the branches to grow to be a low or hedge bush, and both by the suckers
and by laying downe the lower branches into the earth, you may soone haue much
increase; but this way will cause it to bee the longer before it beare anie fruit. The
Rose Baye will verie hardlie bee encreased either by suckers or by layers, but must bee
suffered to grow without lopping, topping or cutting. The Pyracantha or Prickly
Corall tree may bee made to grow into a reasonable tall tree by shredding away the
lower branches, or it may be suffered to grow lowe into an hedge bush, by suffering all
the branches to grow continually, you may also propagate it by the suckers, or by laying
downe the lower branches. The Myrtle of all sorts abideth a low bush spreading
his branches full of sweete leaues and flowers, without anie great encrease of it selfe,
yet sometimes it giueth suckers or shootes from the rootes: but for the more speedie
propagating of them, some doe put the cuttings of them into the earth, and thereby increase
them. There are some other trees that are not of any great respect, as the Yew
tree, and the Savine bush, both which may be encreased by the cuttings, and therefore
I need not make any further relation or amplification of them, and to say thus much of
them all, is (I thinke) sufficient for this Worke.</p>

<i class="sub-title">The ordering, curing, and propagating Vines of all sorts.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">I<span class="looks_big">n</span> most places of this countrie there is small care or paines taken about the ordering
of Vines: it sufficeth for the most part with them that haue anie, to make a
frame for it to spread vpon aboue a mans height, or to tacke it to a wall or window,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and so to let it hang downe with the branches and fruit, vntill the weight
thereof, and the force of windes doe teare it downe oftentimes, and spoile the grapes:
and this way doth somewhat resemble that course that the Vineyard keepers obserue
in the hot countries of Syria, Spaine, and Italy, and in the farthest parts of France as I
hear likewise: for in most of these hot countries they vse to plant an Oliue betweene
two Vines, and let them runne thereupon. But manie of the other parts of France, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
doe not suffer anie trees to growe among their Vines; and therefore they plant them
thicke, and pruine them much and often, and keepe them lowe in comparison of the
other way, fastening them to pearches or poles to hold them vp. And according to
that fashion may haue aduentured to make Vineyards in England, not onely in these
later daies, but in ancient times, as may wel witnesse the sundrie places in this Land, entituled
by the name of Vineyards; and I haue read that manie Monasteries in this Kingdome
hauing Vineyards, had as much wine made therefrom, as sufficed their conuents
yeare by yeare: but long since they haue been destroyed, and the knowledge how to
order a Vineyard is also vtterly perished with them. For although diuers, both No<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>bles
and Gentlemen, haue in these later times endeauoured to plant and make Vineyards,
and to that purpose haue caused French men, being skilfull in keeping and dressing
of Vines, to be brought ouer to performe it, yet either their skill failed them, or
their Vines were not good, or (the most likely) the soile was not fitting, for they could
neuer make anie wine that was worth the drinking, being so small and heartlesse, that
they soone gaue ouer their practice. And indeede the soile is a maine matter to bee
chiefly considered to seate a Vineyard vpon: for euen in France and other hot countries,
according to the nature of the soile, so is the rellish, strength, and durabilitie of
the wine. Now although I think it a fruitlesse labour for any man to striue in these daies
to make a good Vineyard in England, in regard not only of the want of knowledge, to
make choise of the fitted ground for such Vines as you would plant thereupon but also
of the true maner of ordering them in our country; but most chiefly &amp; aboue all others,
that our years in these times do not fal out to be so kindly and hot, to ripen the grapes,
to make anie good wine as formerly they haue done; yet I thinke it not amisse, to giue
you instructions how to order such Vines as you may nourse vp for the pleasure of the
fruit, to eate the grapes being ripe, or to preserue and keepe them to bee eaten almost
all the winter following: And this may be done without any great or extraordinarie
paines. Some doe make a lowe wall, and plant their Vines against it, and keepe them
much about the height thereof, not suffering them to rise much higher: but if the
high bricke or stone wals of your Garden or Orchard haue buttresses thereat, or if
you cause such to bee made, that they bee somewhat broade forwards, you may the
more conueniently plant Vines of diuers sorts at them, and by sticking down a couple
of good stakes at euery buttresse, of eight or ten foot high aboue ground, tacking a few
lathes acrosse vpon those stakes, you may thereunto tye your Vines, &amp; carry them theron
at your pleasure: but you must be carefull to cut them euery year, but not too late,
and so keepe them downe, and from farre spreading, that they neuer runne much beyond
the frame which you set at the buttresses: as also in your cutting you neuer leaue
too many ioynts, nor yet too few, but at the third or fourth ioint at the most cut them
off. I doe aduise you to these frames made with stakes and lathes, for the better ripening
of your grapes: for in the blooming time, if the branches of your vines bee too
neare the wall, the reflection of the Sunne in the day time, and the colde in the night,
doe oftentimes spoile a great deale of fruit, by piercing and withering the tender footstalkes
of the grapes, before they are formed, whereas when the blossomes are past, and
the fruit growing of some bignesse, then all the heate and reflection you can giue them
is fit, and therefore cut away some of the branches with the leaues, to admit the more
Sunne to ripen the fruit. For the diuers sorts of grapes I haue set them downe in the
<a href="#Chap_6_VI" title="go to The Orchard Chapter 6">Booke following</a>, with briefe notes vpon euerie of them, whether white or blacke,
small or great, early or late ripe; so that I neede not here make the same relation again.
There doth happen some diseases to Vines sometimes, which that you may helpe, I
thinke it conuenient to informe you what they are, and how to remedy them when
you shall be troubled with any such. The first is a luxurious spreading of branches and
but little or no fruit: for remedie whereof, cut the branches somewhat more neere
then vsuall, and bare the roote, but take heed of wounding or hurting it, and in the
hole put either some good old rotten stable dung of Horses, or else some Oxe blood
new taken from the beasts, and that in the middle of Ianuarie or beginning of Februarie,
which being well tempered and turned in with the earth, let it so abide, which
no doubt, when the comfort of the blood or dung is well soaked to the bottome by the
raines that fall thereon, will cause your Vine to fructifie againe. Another fault is, when
a Vine doth not bring the fruit to ripenesse, but either it withereth before it be growne
of any bignesse, or presently after the blooming: the place or the earth where such
a Vine standeth, assuredly is too cold, and therefore if the fault bee not in the place,
which cannot bee helped without remouing to a better, digge out a good quantity of
that earth, and put into the place thereof some good fresh ground well heartned with
dung, and some sand mixed therewith (but not salt or salt water, as some doe aduise,
nor yet vrine as others would haue) and this will hearten and strengthen your Vine to
beare out the fruit vnto maturitie. When the leaues of a Vine in the end of Summer
or in Autumne, vntimely doe turne either yellow or red, it is a great signe the earth is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
too hot and drie; you must therefore in stead of dung and sand, as in the former defect
is said, put in some fresh loame or short clay, well mixed together with some of
the earth, and so let them abide, that the frosts may mellow them. And lastly, a Vine
sometimes beareth some store of grapes, but they are too many for it to bring to ripenesse;
you shall therefore helpe such a Vine (which no doubt is of some excellent
kinde, for they are most vsually subiect to this fault) by nipping away the blossomes
from the branches, and leauing but one or two bunches at the most vpon a branch, vntill
the Vine be growne older, and thereby stronger, and by this meane inured to beare
out all the grapes to ripenesse. These be all the diseases I know doe happen to Vines:
for the bleeding of a Vine it seldome happeneth of it selfe, but commeth either by
cutting it vntimely, that is, too late in the yeare, (for after Ianuarie, if you will be well
aduised, cut not any Vine) or by some casuall or wilfull breaking of an arme or a
branch. This bleeding in some is vnto death, in others it stayeth after a certaine space
of it selfe: To helpe this inconuenience, some haue seared the place where it bleedeth
with an hot iron, which in many haue done but a little good; others haue bound the
barke close with packe-thred to stay it; and some haue tied ouer the place, being first
dried as well as may bee, a plaister made with waxe rossen and turpentine while it is
warme. Now for the propagating of them: You must take the fairest and goalest shot
branches of one yeares growth, and cut them off with a peece of the old wood vnto it,
and these being put into the ground before the end of Ianuarie at the furthest, will
shoote forth, and take roote, and so become Vines of the same kinde from whence
you tooke them. This is the most speedy way to haue increase: for the laying downe
of branches to take roote, doth not yeelde such store so plentifully, nor doe suckers
rise from the rootes so aboundantly; yet both these waies doe yeelde Vines that being
taken from the old stockes will become young plants, fit to bee disposed of as any
shall thinke meete.</p>

<i class="sub-title">The way to order and preserue grapes, fit to be eaten almost all the Winter
long, and sometimes vnto the Spring.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent cap">A<span class="looks_big">l</span>though it bee common and vsuall in the parts beyond the Sea to dry their
grapes in the Sunne, thereby to preserue them all the year, as the Raisins of the
Sunne are, which cannot bee done in our Countrie for the want of sufficient
heate thereof at that time: or otherwise to scald them in hot water (as I heare) and
afterwards to dry them, and so keepe them all the yeare, as our Malaga Raisins are prepared
that are packed vp into Frayles: yet I doe intend to shew you some other waies
to preserue the grapes of our Countrie fresh, that they may be eaten in the winter both
before and after Christmas with as much delight and pleasure almost, as when they
were new gathered. One way is, when you haue gathered your grapes you intend to
keepe, which must be in a dry time, and that all the shrunke, dried, or euill grapes in euery
bunch be picked away, and hauing prouided a vessell to hold them, be it of wood
or stone which you will, and a sufficient quantitie of faire and cleane drie sand; make
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stratum super stratum</i> of your grapes and the sand, that is, a lay of sand in the bottome
first, and a lay of grapes vpon them, and a lay or strowing againe of sand vpon those
grapes, so that the sand may couer euery lay of grapes a fingers breadth in thicknesse,
which being done one vpon another vntill the vessell be full, and a lay of sand vppermost,
let the vessell be stopped close, and set by vntill you please to spend them, being
kept in some drie place and in no sellar: let them bee washed cleane in faire water to
take away the sand from so many you will spend at a time. Another way is (which Camerarius
setteth downe he was informed the Turkes vse to keepe grapes all the winter
vnto the next summer) to take so much meale of Mustard seede, as will serue to strow
vpon grapes, vntill they haue filled their vessels, thereon afterwards they poure new
wine before it hath boiled, to fill vp their vessels therwith, and being stopped vp close,
they keepe them a certaine time, and selling them with their liquour to them that will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
vse them, they doe wash the seedes or meale from them when they vse them. Another
way is, that hauing gathered the fairest ripe grapes, they are to be cast vpon threds or
strings that are fastened at both ends to the side walls of a chamber, neere vnto the seeling
thereof, that no one bunch touch another, which will bee so kept a great while,
yet the chamber must be well defended from the frosts, and cold windes that pierce in
at the windowes, lest they perish the sooner: and some will dippe the ends of the
branches they hang vp first in molten pitch, thinking by searing vp the ends to keepe
the bunches the better; but I doe not see any great likelihood therein. Your chamber
or closet you appoint out for this purpose must also bee kept somewhat warme, but especially
in the more cold and frostie time of the yeare, lest it spoile all your cost and
paines, and frustrate you of all your hopes: but although the frosts should pierce and
spoile some of the grapes on a bunch, yet if you be carefull to keepe the place warme,
the fewer will be spoiled. And thus haue I shewed you the best directions to order this
Orchard rightly, and all the waies I know are vsed in our Countrie to keep grapes good
anie long time after the gathering, in regard wee haue not that comfort of a hotter Sun
to preserue them by its heate.</p>

<p>The fruits themselues shall follow euerie one in their order; the lower shrubbes or
bushes first, and the greater afterwards.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e Raspis berrie is of two sorts, white and red, not differing in the forme either
of bush, leafe, or berry, but onely in the colour and taste of the fruit. The
Raspis bush hath tender whitish stemmes, with reddish small prickes like haires
set round about them, especially at the first when they are young; but when they grow
old they become more wooddy and firme, without any shew of thornes or prickles
vpon them, and hath onely a little hairinesse that couereth them: the leaues are somewhat
rough or rugged, and wrinkled, standing three or fiue vpon a stalke, somewhat
like vnto Roses, but greater, and of a grayer greene colour: the flowers are small,
made of fine whitish round leaues, with a dash as it were of blush cast ouer them, many
standing together, yet euery one vpon his owne stalke, at the tops of the branches; after
which come vp small berries, somewhat bigger then Strawberries, and longer, either
red or white, made of many graines, more eminent then in the Strawberry, with
a kinde of douninesse cast ouer them, of a pleasant taste, yet somewhat sowre, and nothing
so pleasant as the Strawberrie. The white Raspis is a little more pleasant then
the red, wherein there is small seede inclosed: the rootes creepe vnder ground verie
farre, and shoote vp againe in many places, much encreasing thereby.</p>

<p>There is another whose stemme and branches are wholly without prickles: the
fruit is red, and somewhat longer, and a little more sharpe.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Raspis.</h4>

<p>The leaues of Raspis may be vsed for want of Bramble leaues in gargles,

please the taste of the sicke as well as the sound.</p>

<p>The iuyce and the distilled water of the berries are verie comfortable
and cordiall.</p>

<p>It is generally held of many, but how true I know not, that the red wine
that is vsually sold at the Vintners, is made of the berries of Raspis that
grow in colder countries, which giueth it a kinde of harshnesse: And also
that of the same berries growing in hotter climates, which giueth vnto the
wine a more pleasant sweetnesse, is made that wine which the Vintners call
Alligant: but we haue a Vine or Grape come to vs vnder the name of the
Alligant Grape, as you shall finde it set downe hereafter among the Grapes;
and therefore it is likely to be but an opinion, and no truth in this, as it

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e bushes that beare those berries, which are vsually called red Currans, are
not those Currans either blew or red, that are sold at the Grocers, nor any kind
thereof; for that they are the grapes of a certaine Vine, as shall be shewed by
and by: but a farre differing kinde of berry, whereof there are three sorts,
red, white, and blacke.</p>

<p>The red Curran bush is of two sorts, and groweth to the height of a man, hauing
sometimes a stemme of two inches thicknesse, and diuers armes and branches, couered
with a smooth, darke, brownish barke, without anie pricke or thorne at all vpon anie
part thereof, whereon doe growe large cornered blackish greene leaues, cut in on the
edges, seeming to be made of fiue parts, almost like a Vine leafe, the ends a little pointing
out, and standing one aboue another on both sides of the branches: the flowers
are little and hollow, comming forth at the ioynts of the leaues, growing many together
on a long stalke, hanging downe aboue a fingers length, and of an herbie colour:
after which come small round fruit or berries, greene at the first, and red as a Cherry
when they are ripe, of a pleasant and tart taste: the other differeth not in anie other
thing then in the berries, being twice as bigge as the former: the roote is wooddy, and
spreadeth diuersly.</p>

<p>The white Curran bush riseth vsually both higher then the red, and straighter or
more vpright, bigger also in the stemme, and couered with a whiter barke: the leaues
are cornered, somewhat like the former, but not so large: the flowers are small and
hollow like the other, hanging downe in the same manner on long stalkes, being of a
whiter colour: the berries likewise growe on the long stalkes, somewhat thicker set together,
and of a cleare white colour, with a little blacke head, so transparent that the
seedes may be easily seene thorough them, and of a more pleasant winie taste then the
red by much.</p>

<p>The blacke Curran bush riseth higher then the white, with more plentifull branches,
and more pliant and twiggie: the stemme and the elder branches being couered
with a brownish barke, and the younger with a paler: the flowers are also like vnto little
bottles as the others be, of a greenish purple colour, which turne into blacke berries,
of the bignesse of the smaller red Currans: the leaues are somewhat like vnto the
leaues of the red Currans, but not so large: both branches, leaues, and fruit haue a kind
of stinking sent with them, yet they are not vnwholsome, but the berries are eaten of
many, without offending either taste or smell.</p>

  <span class="line sub-title">Gooseberries or Feaberries.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">W<span class="looks_big">e</span>e haue diuers sorts of Gooseberries, besides the common kinde, which
is of three sorts, small, great, and long. For wee haue three red Gooseberries,
a blew and a greene.</p>

<p>The common Gooseberrie, or Feaberrie bush, as it is called in diuers Countries of
England, hath oftentimes a great stemme, couered with a smooth darke coloured bark,
without anie thorne thereon, but the elder branches haue here and there some on
them, and the younger are whitish, armed with verie sharpe and cruell crooked thorns,
which no mans hand can well auoide that doth handle them, whereon are set verie
greene and small cornered leaues cut in, of the fashion almost of Smallage, or Hawthorne
leaues, but broad at the stalke: the flowers come forth single, at euerie ioynt of
the leafe one or two, of a purplish greene colour, hollow and turning vp the brims
a little: the berries follow, bearing the flowers on the heads of them, which are of a pale
greene at the first, and of a greenish yellow colour when they are ripe, striped in diuers
places, and cleare, almost transparent, in which the seede lyeth. In some these berries
are small and round; in others much greater; a third is great, but longer then the other:
all of them haue a pleasant winie taste, acceptable to the stomacke of anie (but
the long kinde hath both the thicker skin, and the worser taste of the other) and none
haue been distempered by the eating of them, that euer I could heare of.</p>

<p>The first of the red Gooseberries is better knowne I thinke then the rest, and by
reason of the small bearing not much regarded; the stemme is somewhat bigge, and
couered with a smooth darke coloured barke, the younger branches are whiter, and
without anie thorne or pricke at all, so long, weake, small, and slender, that they lye
vpon the ground, and will there roote againe: the leaues are like vnto the former
Gooseberries, but larger: the flowers and berries stand single, and not manie to bee
found anie yeare vpon them, but are somewhat long, and are as great as the ordinarie
Gooseberry, of a darke brownish red colour, almost blackish when they are ripe, and
of a sweetish taste, but without any great delight.</p>

<p>The second red Gooseberry riseth vp with a more straight stemme, couered with a
brownish barke; the young branches are straight likewise, and whitish, and grow not
so thicke vpon it as the former red kinde, and without any thorne also vpon them: the
leaues are like vnto the former red, but smaller: the berries stand singly at the leaues
as Gooseberries doe, and are of a fine red colour when they are ripe, but change with
standing to be of a darker red colour, of the bignesse of the small ordinary Gooseberry,
of a pretty tart taste, and somewhat sweete withall.</p>

<p>The third red Gooseberry which is the greatest, and knowne but vnto few, is so
like vnto the common great Gooseberry, that it is hardly distinguished: the fruit or
berries grow as plentifully on the branches as the ordinary, and are as great &amp; round
as the great ordinary kinde, but reddish, and some of them paler, with red stripes.</p>

<p>The blew Gooseberry riseth vp to bee a bush like vnto the red Curran, and of the
same bignesse and height, with broader and redder leaues at the first shooting out, then
the second red Gooseberry: the berries are more sparingly set on the branches, then
on the small red, and much about the same bignesse, or rather lesser, of the colour of a
Damson, with an ouershadowing of a blewish colour vpon them, as the Damson hath,
before it be handled or wiped away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_561">[561]</a></span></p>

<p>The greene prickly Gooseberry is very like vnto the ordinary Gooseberry in
stemme and branches, but that they are not stored with so many sharpe prickles; but
the young shootes are more plentifull in small prickles about, and the greene leafe is a
little smaller: the flowers are alike, and so are the berries, being of a middle size, and
not very great, greene when they are thorough ripe as well as before, but mellower,
and hauing a few small short prickles, like small short haires vpon them, which are
harmlesse, and without danger to anie the most dainty and tender palate that is, and
of a verie good pleasant taste. The seede hereof hath produced bushes bearing berries,
hauing few or no prickles vpon them.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Gooseberries.</h4>

<p>The berries of the ordinary Gooseberries, while they are small, greene,
and hard, are much vsed to bee boyled or scalded to make sawce, both for
fish and flesh of diuers sorts, for the sicke sometimes as well as the sound, as
also before they bee neere ripe, to bake into tarts, or otherwise, after manie
fashions, as the cunning of the Cooke, or the pleasure of his commanders
will appoint. They are a fit dish for women with childe to stay their longings,
and to procure an appetite vnto meate.</p>

<p>The other sorts are not vsed in Cookery that I know, but serue to bee
eaten at pleasure; but in regard they are not so tart before maturity as the
former, they are not put to those vses they be.</p>

turne into small, long, and round berries, white at the first, and very red when they are
ripe, of a sharpe sowre taste, fit to set their teeth on edge that eate them: the roote is
yellow, spreading far vnder the vpper part of the ground, but not very deepe.</p>

<p>There is (as it is thought) another kinde, whose berries are thrice as bigge as the
former, which I confesse I haue not seene, and know not whether it be true or no: for
it may peraduenture be but the same, the goodnesse of the ground and ayre where they
growe, and the youngnesse of the bushes causing that largenesse, as I haue obserued in
the same kinde, to yeeld greater berries.</p>

<p>There is said to be also another kinde, whose berries should be without stones or
seede within them, not differing else in anie thing from the former: but because I
haue long heard of it, and cannot vnderstand by all the inquirie I haue made, that
any hath seene such a fruit, I rest doubtfull of it.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Barberries.</h4>

<p>Some doe vse the leaues of Barberries in the stead of Sorrell, to make
sawce for meate, and by reason of their sowrenesse are of the same quality.</p>

<p>The berries are vsed to be pickled, to serue to trimme or set out dishes of
fish and flesh in broth, or otherwise, as also sometime to bee boyled in the
broth, to giue it a sharpe rellish, and many other wayes, as a Master Cooke
can better tell then my selfe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_562">[562]</a></span></p>

<p>The berries are preserued and conserued to giue to sicke bodies, to helpe
to coole any heate in the stomacke or mouth, and quicken the appetite.</p>

<p>The depurate iuyce is a fine menstrue to dissolue many things, and to verie
good purpose, if it be cunningly handled by an Artist.</p>

<p>The yellow inner barke of the branches, or of the rootes, are vsed to be
boyled in Ale, or other drinkes, to be giuen to those that haue the yellow
iaundise: As also for them that haue anie fluxes of choller, to helpe to stay
and binde.</p>

<p>Clusius setteth downe a secret that hee had of a friend, of a cleane differing
propertie, which was, that if the yellow barke were laid in steepe in
white wine for the space of three houres, and afterwards drunke, it would
purge one very wonderfully.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e Filberd tree that is planted in Orchards, is very like vnto the Hasell nut tree
that groweth wilde in the woods, growing vpright, parted into many boughes
and tough plyable twigges, without knots, couered with a brownish, speckled,
smooth, thinne rinde, and greene vnderneath: the leaues are broad, large, wrinkled,
and full of veines, cut in on the edges into deepe dents, but not into any gashes, of a
darke greene colour on the vpperside, and of a grayish ash colour vnderneath: it hath
small and long catkins in stead of flowers, that come forth in the Winter, when as they
are firme and close, and in the Spring open themselues somewhat more, growing
longer, and of a brownish yellow colour: the nuts come not vpon those stalkes that
bore those catkins, but by themselues, and are wholly inclosed in long, thicke, rough
huskes, bearded as it were at the vpper ends, or cut into diuers long iagges, much
more then the wood nut: the nut hath a thinne and somewhat hard shell, but not so
thicke and hard as the wood nut, in some longer then in other, and in the long kinde,
one hath the skinne white that couereth the kernels, and another red.</p>

<p>There is another sort of the round kinde that came from Constantinople, whose
huske is more cut, torne, or iagged, both aboue and belowe, then any of our country;
the barke also is whiter, and more rugged then ours, and the leaues somewhat larger.</p>

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere is so great diuersities of Grapes, and so consequently of Vines that bear
them, that I cannot giue you names to all that here grow with vs: for Iohn
Tradescante my verie good friend, so often before remembred, hath assured
me, that he hath twentie sorts growing with him, that hee neuer knew how or by what
name to call them. One description therefore shall serue (as I vse to doe in such varieties)
for all the rest, with the names afterwards, of as many as we can giue, and the seuerall
formes, colours and proportions of the grapes.</p>

<p>The manured Vine, in the places where it hath abiden long time, groweth to haue a
great bodie, stemme or trunke, sometimes of the bignesse of a mans arme, sleeue and
all, spreading branches if it bee suffered without end or measure, but vsually stored
with many armes or branches, both old and new, but weake, and therefore must bee
sustained; whereof the old are couered with a thin scaly rinde, which will often chap
and peele off of it selfe; the youngest being of a reddish colour, smooth and firme,
with a hollownesse or pith in the middle: from the ioints of the young branches, and
sometimes from the bodie of the elder, breake out on euerie side broade greene leaues,
cut on the edges into fiue diuisions for the most part, and besides notched or dented
about: right against the leafe, and likewise at other ioynts of the branches, come
forth long twining or clasping tendrels, winding themselues about any thing standeth
next vnto them: at the bottome of these leaues come forth clusters of small greenish
yellow bloomes or flowers, and after them the berries, growing in the same manner in
clusters, but of diuers formes, colours, tastes and greatnesse. For some grapes are great,
others lesse, some very small (as the Currans that the Grocers sell) some white, some
red, blew, blacke, or partie-coloured, some are as it were square, others round:
some the clusters are close, others open, some are sweete, others sower or harsh, or of
some other mixed taste; euerie one differing from others, verie notably either in taste,
colour or forme; within euerie one of which grapes, (and yet there is a grape without
stones) are contained one, two, or more kernels or stones, some of them being smal,
others greater: the rootes spread far and deepe. They that keepe their Vines in the
best order, doe cut them low, not suffering them to grow high, or with too many branches,
whereby they grow the better, take vp the lesser roome, and bring their grapes
fairer and sweeter.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The kindes of Vines and Grapes.</h4>

<p>Our ordinarie Grape both white and red, which excelleth Crabs for veriuice,
and is not fit for wine with vs.</p>

<p>The white Muscadine Grape is a verie great Grape, sweete and firme,
some of the bunches haue weighed sixe pound, and some of the grapes
halfe an ounce.</p>

<p>The redde Muscadine is as great as the white, and chiefly differeth in colour.</p>

<p>The Burlet is a very great white Grape, but fitter for veriuice; then wine
for the most part; yet when a hot yeare happeneth fit for it, the Grape is
pleasant.</p>

<p>The little blacke Grape that is ripe very early.</p>

<p>The Raisin of the Sunne Grape is a very great Grape, and very great clusters,
of a reddish colour when it is ripe with vs, yet in an extraordinarie
hot yeare, it hath got a little blewnesse cast ouer by the best: but naturally
verie blew.</p>

<p>The Curran Grape (or the Grape of Corinth) is the least Grape of all,
and beareth both few, and verie seldome with vs, but in reasonable great
clusters, and of a blackish blew colour, when they are ripe with vs, and very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
sweete. There is another sort of them that are red or browne, and of a sower
taste, nothing so sweete.</p>

<p>The Greeke wine Grape is a blackish Grape, and very sweete.</p>

<p>The Frontignack is a white Grape, of a verie sweete and delicate taste, as
the wine declareth, that smelleth as it were of Muske.</p>

<p>The square Grape is reported to bear a Grape not fully round, but sided,
or as it were square, whereby it became so called.</p>

<p>The Damasco Grape is a great white grape, very sweete, and is the true
<i>Vva Zibeba</i>, that the Apothecaries should vse in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochisci Ciphi</i>: and such
wee haue had in former times come ouer vnto vs in great, long and round
white boxes, containing halfe an hundred weight a peece.</p>

<p>The Russet Grape is a reasonable faire grape, exceeding sweet and whitish,
with a thicke skinne, crusted ouer with a shew of ash colour.</p>

<p>The white long Grape is like vnto a Pigeons egge, or as it were pointed
pendent like a Pearle.</p>

<p>The partie-coloured Grape is a reasonable great Grape, and discoloured
when it is ripe, sometimes the whole bunches, and sometimes but some of
the grapes being parted whitish, and blacke halfe through, verie variably.</p>

<p>The Rhenish wine Grape is a white Grape, and endureth the cold of winter
when it commeth earely, more then the Muscadine before set downe,
and is nothing so sweete.</p>

<p>The White wine Grape is verie like vnto the Rhine Grape, the soile only
and climate adding more sweetnesse vnto the one then to the other.</p>

<p>The Claret wine Grape is altogether like the white Grape, but that it is
not white, but of a reddish colour, which lying bruised vpon the skins before
they are pressed, giue that Claret tincture to the wine.</p>

<p>The Teint is a Grape of a deeper or darker colour, whose iuice is of so
deepe a colour, that it serueth to colour other wine.</p>

<p>The Bursarobe is a faire sweete white Grape of much esteeme about
Paris.</p>

<p>The Alligant is a verie sweete Grape, giuing so deep and liuely a coloured
red wine, that no other whatsoeuer is comparable to it, and therefore vsually
called Spaniards blood.</p>

<p>The blew or blacke Grape of Orleans is another blacke Grape, giuing a
darke coloured sweete wine much commended in those parts.</p>

<p>The Grape without stones is also a kinde by it selfe, and groweth naturally
neere Ascalon, as Brochard affirmeth, the wine whereof is redde, and
of a good taste.</p>

<p>The Virginia Vine, whereof I must needes make mention among other
Vines, beareth small Grapes without any great store of iuice therein, and
the stone within it bigger then in any other Grape: naturally it runneth on
the ground, and beareth little.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Vines, Grapes, and other parts that come of them.</h4>

<p>The greene leaues of the Vine are cooling and binding, and therefore
good to put among other herbes that make gargles and lotions for sore
mouthes.</p>

<p>And also to put into the broths and drinke of those that haue hot burning
feauers, or any other inflammation.</p>

<p>They stay (as it is held for true) womens longings, if they be either taken
inwardly, or applyed outwardly.</p>

<p>Wine is vsually taken both for drinke and medicine, and is often put
into sawces, broths, cawdles, and gellies that are giuen to the sicke. As also
into diuers Physicall drinkes, to be as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vehiculum</i> for the properties of the
ingredients.</p>

<p>It is distilled likewise after diuers manners, with diuers things, for diuers
&amp; sundry waters to drinke, &amp; for diuers purposes both inward and outward.</p>


<p>Also distilled of it selfe, is called Spirit of wine, which serueth to dissolue,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
and to draw out the tincture of diuers things, and for many other purposes.</p>

<p>The iuice or veriuice that is made of greene hard grapes, before they be
ripe, is vsed of the Apothecaries to be made into a Syrupe, that is very good
to coole and refresh a faint stomacke.</p>

<p>And being made of the riper grapes is the best veriuice, farre exceeding
that which is made of crabs, to be kept all the yeare, to be put both into
meates and medicines.</p>

<p>The grapes of the best sorts of Vines are pressed into wine by some in
these dayes with vs, and much more as I verily beleeue in times past, as by
the name of Vineyard giuen to many places in this Kingdome, especially
where Abbies and Monasteries stood, may bee coniectured: but the wine
of late made hath beene but small, and not durable, like that which commeth
from beyond Sea, whether our vnkindly yeares, or the want of skill,
or a conuenient place for a Vineyard be the cause, I cannot well tell you.</p>

<p>Grapes of all sorts are familiarly eaten when they are ripe, of the sicke
sometimes as well as the sound.</p>

<p>The dryed grapes which we call great Raysins, and the Currans which
we call small Raysins, are much vsed both for meates, broths, and sawces,
in diuers manners, and this Countrey in generall aboue any other, wherein
many thousands of Frailes full, Pipes, Hogs-heads, and Buts full are spent
yearly, that it breedeth a wonder in them of those parts where they growe
and prouide them, how we could spend so many.</p>

<p>The Raysins of the Sunne are the best dryed grapes, next vnto the Damasco,
and are very wholsome to eate fasting, both to nourish, and to helpe
to loosen the belly.</p>

<p>The dryed Lees of wine called Argoll or Tartar, is put to the vse of the
Goldsmith, Dyer, and Apothecary, who doe all vse it in seuerall manners,
euery one in his art.</p>

<p>Of it the Apothecaries make <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cremor Tartari</i>, a fine medicine to bee vsed,
as the Physitian can best appoint, and doth helpe to purge humours by the
stoole.</p>

<p>Thereof likewise they make a kinde of water or oyle, fit to bee vsed, to
take away freckles, spots, or any such deformities of the face or skinne, and
to make it smooth. It causeth likewise haire to growe more aboundantly in
those places where it naturally should growe.</p>

<p>The liquor of the Vine that runneth forth when it is cut, is commended
to be good against the stone wheresoeuer it be; but that liquor that is taken
from the end of the branches when they are burnt, is most effectuall to take
away spots and markes, ring-wormes and tetters in any place.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e Figge trees that are noursed vp in our country are of three sorts, whereof
two are high; the one bearing against a wall goodly sweete and delicate Figs,
called Figs of Algarua, and is blewish when it is ripe: the other tall kinde is
nothing so good, neither doth beare ripe Figges so kindly and well, and peraduenture
may be the white ordinary kinde that commeth from Spaine. The third is a dwarfe
kinde of Figge tree, not growing much higher then to a mans body or shoulders, bearing
excellent good Figges and blew, but not so large as the first kinde.</p>

<p>The Figge trees of all these three kindes are in leaues and growing one like vnto another,
sauing for their height, colour, and sweetnesse of the fruit, hauing many armes
or branches, hollow or pithy in the middle, bearing large leaues, and somewhat
thicke, diuided sometimes into three, but vsually into fiue sections, of a darke greene
colour on the vpperside, and whitish vnderneath, yeelding a milkie iuyce when it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
broken, as the branches also or the figges when they are greene: the fruit breaketh out
from the branches without anie blossome, contrary to all other trees of our Orchard,
being round and long, fashioned very like vnto a small Peare, full of small white grains
or kernels within it, of a very sweete taste when it is ripe, and very mellow or soft, that
it can hardly be carried farre without bruising.</p>

<p>The other two sorts you may easily know and vnderstand, by so much as hath been
said of them. Take only this more of the Figge tree, That if you plant it not against a
bricke wall, or the wall of an house, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> it will not ripen so kindly. The dwarfe Figge
tree is more tender, and is therefore planted in great square tubs, to be remoued into
the sunne in the Summer time, and into the house in Winter.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Figges.</h4>

<p>Figges are serued to the table with Raysins of the Sunne, and blanched
Almonds, for a Lenten dish.</p>

<p>The Figs that growe with vs when they are ripe, and fresh gathered, are
eaten of diuers with a little salt and pepper, as a dainty banquet to entertaine
a friend, which seldome passeth without a cup of wine to wash them downe.</p>

<p>In Italy (as I haue beene enformed by diuers Gentlemen that haue liued
there to study physicke) they eate them in the same manner, but dare not
eate many for feare of a feuer to follow, they doe account them to be such
breeders of bloud, and heaters of it likewise.</p>

<p>The Figges that are brought vs from Spaine, are vsed to make Ptisan
drinkes, and diuers other things, that are giuen them that haue coughes or
colds.</p>

<p>It is one of the ingredients also with Nuts and Rue, into Mithridates
counterpoison.</p>

<p>The small Figges that growe with vs, and will not ripen, are preserued by
the Comfitmakers, and candid also, to serue as other moist or candid banquetting

  <span class="line sub-title">The Seruice tree.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are two kindes of Seruice trees that are planted in Orchards with vs, and
there is also a wilde kinde like vnto the later of them, with Ashen leaues, found
in the woods growing of it selfe, whose fruit is not gathered, nor vsed to bee
eaten of any but birds. And there is another kinde also growing wilde abroad in many
places, taken by the Country people where it groweth, to be a Seruice tree, and is called
in Latine, <i>Aria Theophrasti</i>, whose leaues are large, somewhat like Nut tree leaues,
but greene aboue, and grayish vnderneath: some doe vse the fruit as Seruices, and for
the same purposes to good effect, yet both of these wilde kindes wee leaue for another
worke, and here declare vnto you onely those two sorts are noursed vp in our Orchards.</p>

<p>The more common or ordinary Seruice tree with vs, is a reasonable great tree, couered
with a smooth barke, spread into many great armes, whereon are set large leaues,
very much cut in on the edges, almost like vnto a Vine leafe, or rather like vnto that
kinde of Maple, that is vsually called the Sycomore tree with vs: the flowers are white,
and growe many clustering together, which after bring forth small browne berries
when they are ripe, of the bignesse almost of Hasell nuts, with a small tuft, as if it were
a crowne on the head, wherein are small blacke kernels.</p>

<p>The other kinde, which is more rare with vs, and brought into this Land by Iohn
Tradescante, heretofore often remembered, hath diuers winged leaues, many set together
like vnto an Ashen leafe, but smaller, and euery one endented about the edges:
the flowers growe in long clusters, but nothing so many, or so close set as the wilde
kinde: the fruit of this tree is in some round like an Apple, and in others a little longer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
like a Peare, but of a more pleasant taste then the ordinarie kinde, when they are ripe
and mellowed, as they vse to doe with both these kindes, and with Medlars.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Seruices.</h4>

<p>They are gathered when they growe to be neare ripe (and that is neuer
before they haue felt some frosts) and being tyed together, are either hung
vp in some warme roome, to ripen them thoroughly, that they may bee
eaten, or (as some vse to doe) lay them in strawe, chaffe, or branne, to ripen
them.</p>

<p>They are binding, fit to be taken of them that haue any scouring or laske,
to helpe to stay the fluxe; but take heed, lest if you binde too much, more
paine and danger may come thereof then of the scouring.</p>

  <span class="line sub-title">The Medlar tree.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are three sorts of Medlars: The greater and the lesser English, and the
Neapolitan.</p>

<p>The great and the small English Medlar differ not one from the other in any
thing, but in the size of the fruit, except that the small kinde hath some prickes or
thornes vpon it, which the great one hath not, bearing diuers boughes or armes, from
whence breake forth diuers branches, whereon are set long and somewhat narrow
leaues, many standing together; in the middle whereof, at the end of the branch, commeth
the flower, which is great and white, made of fiue leaues, broad at the ends, with
a nicke in the middle of euery one; after which commeth the fruit, being round, and of
a pale brownish colour, bearing a crowne of those small leaues at the toppe, which
were the huske of the flower before, the middle thereof being somewhat hollow, and
is harsh, able to choake any that shall eate it before it be made mellow, wherein there
are certaine flat and hard kernels.</p>

<p>The Medlar of Naples groweth likewise to bee a reasonable great tree, spreading
forth armes and branches, whereon are set many gashed leaues, somewhat like vnto
Hawthorne leaues, but greater, and likewise diuers thornes in many places: the flowers
are of an herbie greene colour, and small, which turne into smaller fruit then the
former, and rounder also, but with a small head or crowne at the toppe like vnto it,
and is of a more sweete and pleasant taste then the other, with three seeds only therein
ordinarily.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Medlars.</h4>

<p>Medlars are vsed in the same manner that Seruices are, that is, to be eaten
when they are mellowed, and are for the same purposes to binde the body
when there is a cause: yet they as well as the Seruices, are often eaten by
them that haue no neede of binding, and but onely for the pleasant sweetnesse
of them when they are made mellow, and sometimes come as a dish
of ripe fruit at their fit season, to be serued with other sorts to the table.</p>

<p>The first kinde of Lote tree, whereof Dioscorides maketh mention, is but of one
kinde; but there are some other trees spoken of by Theophrastus, that may be
referred thereunto, which may bee accounted as bastard kindes thereof, of
which I meane to entreate in this Chapter, hauing giuen you before the description<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
of another kinde hereof (by the opinion of good Authors) vnder the name of <i>Laurocerasus</i>.</p>

<p>The first or true Lote tree groweth to be a tree of a great height, whose bodie and
elder branches are couered with a smooth darke greene barke, the leaues are somewhat
rough in handling, of a darke greene colour, long pointed, and somewhat deepe dented
about the edges, somewhat like vnto a Nettle leafe, and oftentimes growe yellow
toward Autumne: the flowers stand here and there scattered vpon the branches, after
which come round berries like vnto Cherries, hanging downewards vpon long footstalkes,
greene at the first, and whitish afterwards; but when they are ripe they become
reddish, and if they be suffered to hang too long on the branches, they grow blackish,
of a pleasant austere taste, not to be misliked, wherein is a hard round stone.</p>

<p>The second, which is a bastard kinde, and called <i>Guaiacum Patauinum</i>, groweth to
bee a faire tree, with a smooth darke greene barke, shooting out many faire great
boughes, and also slender greene branches, beset with faire broad greene leaues, almost
like vnto the leaues of the Cornell tree, but larger: the flowers growe along the
branches close vnto them, without any or with a very short foote-stalke consisting of
foure greene leaues, which are as the huske, containing within it a purplish flower,
made of foure leaues somewhat reddish: the fruit standeth in the middle of the green
huske, greene at the first, and very harsh, but red and round when it is ripe, and somewhat
like a Plumme, with a small point or pricke at the head thereof, and of a reasonable
pleasant taste or rellish, wherein are contained flat and thicke browne seeds or kernels,
like vnto the kernels of <i>Cassia Fistula</i>, somewhat hard, and not so stonie, but that
it may somewhat easily be cut with a knife.</p>

<p id="Chap_6_Xa">The third is called in Virginia <i>Pishamin</i>, The Virginia Plumme (if it be not all one
with the former Guaiacana, whereof I am more then halfe perswaded) hath growne
with vs of the kernels that were sent out of Virginia, into great trees, whose wood is
very hard and brittle, and somewhat white withall: the branches are many, and grow
slender to the end, couered with a very thinne greenish bark, whereon doe grow many
faire broad greene leaues, without dent or notch on the edges, and so like vnto the former
<i>Guaiacum</i>, that I verily thinke it (as I before said) to bee the same. It hath not yet
borne flower or fruit in our Countrey that I can vnderstand: but the fruit, as it was
sent to vs, is in forme and bignesse like vnto a Date, couered with a blackish skinne,
set in a huske of foure hard leaues, very firme like vnto a Date, and almost as sweete,
with great flat and thicke kernels within them, very like vnto the former, but larger.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of these Lote trees.</h4>

<p>The first sort is eaten as an helper to coole and binde the body: the last,
as Captaine Smith relateth in the discouery of Virginia, if the fruit be eaten
while it is greene, and not ripe, is able by the harsh and binding taste and
quality to draw ones mouth awry (euen as it is said of the former Guaiacana)
but when it is thorough ripe it is pleasant, as I said before.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e Cornell tree that is planted in Orchards, being the male (for the female is
an hedge bush) is of two sorts, the one bearing red, the other whiter berries,
which is very rare yet in our country, and not differing else.</p>

<p>It groweth to a reasonable bignesse and height, yet neuer to any great tree, the wood
whereof is very hard, like vnto horne, and thereof it obtained the name: the body
and branches are couered with a rugged barke, and spreadeth reasonable well, hauing
somewhat smooth leaues, full of veines, plaine, and not dented on the edges: the flowers
are many small yellow tufts, as it were of short haires or threads set together,
which come forth before any leafe, and fall away likewise before any leafe bee much
open: the fruit are long and round berries, of the bignesse of small Oliues, with an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
hard round stone within them, like vnto an Oliue stone, and are of a yellowish red
when they are ripe, of a reasonable pleasant taste, yet somewhat austere withall.</p>

<p>The white (as I said) is like vnto the red, but onely that his fruit is more white when
it is ripe.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of the Cornelles.</h4>

<p>They helpe to binde the body, and to stay laskes, and by reason of the
pleasantnesse in them when they are ripe, they are much desired.</p>

<p>They are also preserued and eaten, both for rarity and delight, and for
the purpose aforesaid.</p>

</h3>

<p>There are so many varieties and differences of Cherries, that I know not well
how to expresse them vnto you, without a large relation of their seuerall
formes. I will therefore endeauour after one generall description (as my custome
is in many other the like variable fruits) to giue as briefe and short notes vpon all
the rest, as I can both for leafe and fruit, that so you may the better know what the
fruit is, when you haue the name.</p>

<p>The English Cherrie tree groweth in time to be of a reasonable bignesse and height,
spreading great armes, and also small twiggy branches plentifully; the leaues whereof
are not verie large or long, but nicked or dented about the edges: the flowers come
forth two or three or foure at the most together, at a knot or ioynt, euerie one by it
selfe, vpon his owne small and long footestalke, consisting of fiue white leaues, with
some threds in the middle; after which come round berries, greene at the first, and
red when they are through ripe, of a meane bignesse, and of a pleasant sweete taste,
somewhat tart withall, with a hard white stone within it, whose kernell is somewhat
bitter, but not vnpleasant.</p>

<p>The Flanders Cherrie differeth not from the English, but that it is somewhat larger,
and the Cherry somewhat greater and sweeter, and not so sower.</p>

<p>The early Flanders Cherry is more rathe or early ripe, almost as soone as the May
Cherry, especially planted against a wall, and of many false knaues or Gardiners are
sold for May Cherrie trees.</p>

<p>The May Cherrie in a standard beareth ripe fruite later then planted against a wall,
where the berries will be red in the verie beginning of May sometimes.</p>

<p>The Arch-Dukes Cherrie is one of the fairest and best cherries wee haue, being of a
very red colour when it is ripe, and a little long more then round, and somewhat pointed
at the end, of the best rellish of any Cherrie whatsoeuer, and of a firme substance;
scarce one of twentie of our Nurserie men doe sell the right, but giue one for another:
for it is an inherent qualitie almost hereditarie with most of them, to sell any man an
ordinary fruit for whatsoeuer rare fruit he shall aske for: so little they are to be trusted.</p>

<p>The ounce Cherrie hath the greatest and broadest leafe of any other cherrie, but
beareth the smallest store of cherries euerie yeare that any doth, and yet blossometh
well: the fruit also is nothing answerable to the name being not verie great, of a pale
yellowish red, neere the colour of Amber, and therefore some haue called it, the Amber
Cherrie.</p>

<p>The great leafed Cherrie is thought of diuers to bee the Ounce Cherrie, because it
hath almost as great a leafe as the former: but the fruit of this also doth not answer the
expectation of so great a leafe, being but of a meane bignesse, and a small bearer, yet of
a pale reddish colour.</p>

<p>The true Gascoign Cherry is known but to a few; for our Nursery men do so change
the names of most fruits they sell, that they deliuer but very few true names to any: In
former times before our wilde blacke Cherrie was found to grow plentifully in our
owne woods in many places of this Land, the French continually stored vs with wilde
stockes to graft vpon, which then were called Gascoigne stocks, but since they haue so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
termed another red Cherrie, and obtruded it vpon their customers: but the true is one
of our late ripe white Cherries, euen as Gerard saith, it is a great cherrie and spotted:
and this is that Cherrie I so commend to be a fit stocke to graft May cherries vpon.</p>

<p>The Morello Cherrie is of a reasonable bignesse, of a darke red colour when they
are full ripe, and hang long on, of a sweetish sower taste, the pulpe or substance is red,
and somewhat firme: if they be dryed they will haue a fine sharpe or sower taste very
delectable.</p>

<p>The Hartlippe Cherrie is so called of the place where the best of this kinde is noursed
vp, being betweene Sittingbourne and Chattam in Kent, and is the biggest of our
English kindes.</p>

<p>The smaller Lacure or Hart Cherrie is a reasonable faire Cherrie, full aboue, and a
little pointing downward, after the fashion of an heart, as it is vsually painted, blackish
when it is full ripe, and lesser then the next.</p>

<p>The great Lacure or Hart Cherrie differeth not in forme, but in greatnesse, being vsually
twice as great as the former, and of a reddish blacke colour also: both of them
are of a firme substance, and reasonable sweete. Some doe call the white cherrie, the
White hart cherrie.</p>

<p>The Luke Wardes Cherrie hath a reasonable large leafe, and a larger flower then
many other: the cherries grow with long stalkes, and a stone of a meane size within
them, of a darke reddish colour when they are full ripe, of a reasonable good rellish,
and beareth well.</p>

<p>The Corone Cherrie hath a leafe little differing from the Luke Wardes cherrie; the
fruit when it is ripe, is of a faire deepe red colour, of a good bignesse, and of a verie
good taste, neither verie sweete or sower: the pulpe or iuice will staine the hands.</p>

<p>The Vrinall Cherrie in a most fruitfull yeare is a small bearer, hauing many yeares
none, and the best but a few; yet doth blossome plentifully euery yeare for the most
part: the cherrie is long and round, like vnto an Vrinall, from whence it tooke his
name; reddish when it is full ripe, and of an indifferent sweete rellish.</p>

<p>The Agriot Cherrie is but a small Cherrie, of a deepe redde colour when it is ripe,
which is late; of a fine sharpe taste, most pleasant and wholsome to the stomacke of all
other cherries, as well while they are fresh as being dryed, which manner they much
vse in France, and keepe them for the vse both of the sicke and sound at all times.</p>

<p>The Biguarre Cherrie is a fair cherrie, much spotted with white spots vpon the pale
red berry, and sometimes discoloured halfe white and halfe reddish, of a reasonable
good rellish.</p>

<p>The Morocco Cherrie hath a large white blossome, and an indifferent big berrie,
long and round, with a long stalke of a darke reddish purple colour, a little tending to
a blew when it is full ripe, of a firme substance: the iuice is of a blackish red, discolouring
the hands or lips, and of a pleasant taste: Some doe thinke that this and the
Morello be both one.</p>

<p>The Naples Cherrie is also thought to bee all one with the Morello or Morocco.</p>

<p>The white Spanish Cherrie is an indifferent good bearer, the leafe and blossome
somewhat large, and like the Luke Wardes cherrie: the cherries are reasonable faire
berries, with long stalkes and great stones, white on the outside, with some rednesse,
on the one side of a firme substance, and reasonable sweet, but with a little aciditie, and
is one of the late ripe ones: But there is another late ripe white Cherry, which some
call the Gascoigne, before remembred.</p>

<p>The Flanders cluster Cherrie is of two sorts, one greater then another: the greater
kinde hath an indifferent large leafe; the blossomes haue many threds within them,
shewing as it were many parts, which after turne into clusters of berries, foure, fiue or
sixe together, and but with one stalke vnder them, as if they grew one out of another,
and sometimes they will beare but two or three, and most of them but one cherry on a
stalke, which are red when they are ripe, very tender, and waterish sweete in eating.</p>

<p>The lesser is in all things like the greater, but smaller, which maketh the difference.</p>

<p>The wilde cluster or birds cluster Cherry beareth many blossomes set all along the
stalkes, and cherries after them in the same maner, like a long thinne bunch of grapes,
and therefore called of some the Grape cherry: there are of them both red and
blacke.</p>

<p>The soft sheld Cherrie is a small red cherrie when it is ripe, hauing the stone within
it so soft and tender, that it may easily be broken in the eating of the cherrie.</p>

<p>Iohn Tradescantes Cherrie is most vsually sold by our Nursery Gardiners, for the
Archdukes cherrie, because they haue more plenty thereof, and will better be increased,
and because it is so faire and good a cherrie that it may be obtruded without much
discontent: it is a reasonable good bearer, a faire great berrie, deepe coloured, and a
little pointed.</p>

<p>The Baccalaos or New-found-land Cherrie hath a shining long leafe, most like vnto
a Peach leafe, the blossomes come very many together as it were in an vmbell, which
is such a cluster as is neither like the Flanders cluster, nor the wilde cluster cherrie blossome:
it bringeth forth berries standing in the same manner euerie one vpon his own
footestalke, being no bigger then the largest berrie of the red Curran tree or bush, of a
pale or waterish red colour when it is ripe.</p>

<p>The strange long cluster Cherrie, or <i>Padus Theophrasti Dalechampio</i> is reckoned by
the Author of that great <cite>Herball</cite> that goeth vnder his name, among the sorts of cherries;
and so must I vntill a fitter place be found for it. It groweth in time to be a great
tree, with a sad coloured barke both on the bodie and branches, whereon doe grow
many leaues, somewhat broade, shorter, harder, and a little more crumpled then any
cherrie leafe: the blossomes are very small, and of a pale or whitish colour, smelling
very sweete and strong, or rather heady, like Orenge flowers, growing on small long
branches, very like the toppe of flowers vpon the Laburnum or Beane trefoile trees:
after which come small blacke berries, growing together all along the long stalke, like
vnto the wilde cluster or birds cherrie mentioned before, but not much bigger then
tares, with small stones within them, and little or no sustance vpon them: the French
call the tree <i>Putier</i>, because the wood thereof stinketh, and make it to be wonderfull
that the blossomes of the tree mould be so sweete, and the wood so stinking.</p>

<p>The Cullen Cherrie is a darke red cherrie like the Agriot, which they of those parts
neere Cullen and Vtrecht <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> vse to put into their drinke, to giue it the deeper colour.</p>

<p>The great Hungarian Cherrie of Zwerts is like both in leafe and fruite vnto the
Morello cherrie, but much greater and fairer, and a far better bearer: for from a small
branch hath beene gathered a pound of cherries, and this is vsuall continually, and not
accidentally, most of them foure inches in compasse about, and very many of them
more of a faire deepe red colour, and very sweete, excelling the Arch-Dukes cherry,
or any other whatsoeuer.</p>

<p>The Cameleon or strange changeable Cherry deseruedly hath this name, although
of mine owne imposition, not only because it beareth vsually both blossomes, greene
and ripe fruit at one time thereupon, but that the fruit will be of many formes; some
round, some as it were square, and some bunched forth on one side or another, abiding
constant in no fashion, but for the most part shewing forth all these diuersities euerie
yeare growing vpon it: the fruit is of a very red colour, and good taste.</p>

<p>The great Rose Cherry, or double blossomd Cherry differeth not in any thing from
the English Cherrie, but only in the blossomes, which are very thicke of white leaues,
as great and double as the double white Crowfoote, before remembred, and sometimes
out of the middle of them will spring another smaller flower, but double also; this seldome
beareth fruit, but when it doth I suppose it commeth from those blossomes are
the least double, and is red, no bigger then our ordinary English cherrie.</p>

<p>The lesser Rose or double blossomd Cherrie beareth double flowers also, but not so
thicke and double as the former; but beareth fruit more plentifully, of the same colour
and bignesse with the former.</p>

<p>The Dwarfe Cherrie is of two sorts; one whose branches fall downe low, round about
the body of it, with small greene leaues, and fruit as small, of a deep red colour.</p>

<p>The other, whose branches, although small, grow more vpright, hauing greener shining
leaues: the fruit is little bigger then the former, red also when it is ripe, with a litle
point at the end: both of them of a sweetish rellish, but more sower.</p>

<p>The great bearing Cherry of Master Millen is a reasonable great red cherry, bearing
very plentifully, although it bee planted against a North wall, yet it will bee late ripe,
but of an indifferent sweet and good rellish.</p>

<p>The long finger Cherry is another small long red one, being long &amp; round like a finger,
wherof it took the name: this is not the Vrinall cherry before, but differing from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_575">[575]</a></span></p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Cherries.</h4>

<p>All these sorts of Cherries serue wholly to please the palate, and are eaten
at all times, both before and after meales.</p>

<p>All Cherries are cold, yet the sower more then the sweete; and although
the sweete doe most please, yet the sower are more wholsome, if there bee
regard taken in the vsing.</p>

<p>The Agriot or sower Cherries are in France much vsed to bee dryed (as
is said before) as Pruines are, and so serue to be ministred to the sicke in all hot
diseases, as feuers <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> being both boyled in their drinkes, and taken now
and then of themselues, which by reason of their tartnesse, doe please the
stomacke passing well.</p>

<p>The Gum of the Cherrie tree is commended to bee good for those are
troubled with the grauell or stone. It is also good for the cough being dissolued
in liquour, and stirreth vp an appetite. The distilled water of the
blacke Cherries, the stones being broken among them, is vsed for the same
purpose, for the grauell, stone, and winde.</p>

  <span class="line sub-title">The Plumme tree.</span>
</h3>

<p>There are many more varieties of Plummes then of Cherries, so that I must
follow the same order with these that I did with them, euen giue you their
names apart, with briefe notes vpon them, and one description to serue for all
the rest. And in this recitall I shall leaue out the Apricockes which are certainly a kind
of Plum, of an especiall difference, and not of a Peach, as Galen and some others haue
thought, and set them in a <a href="#Chap_6_XIIII" title="go to Orchard chapter 14">chapter</a> by themselues, and only in this set down those fruits
are vsually called Plums.</p>

<p>The Plum tree (especially diuers of them) riseth in time to bee a reasonable tall and
great tree, whose bodie and greater armes are couered with a more rugged barke, yet
in some more or lesse, the younger branches being smooth in all, the leaues are somewhat
rounder then those of the Cherrie tree, and much differing among themselues,
some being longer, or larger, or rounder then others, and many that are exercised herein,
can tell by the leafe what Plum the tree beareth (I speake this of many, not of all) as
in many Cherries they can doe the like: the flowers are white, consisting of fiue
leaues: the fruit is as variable in forme, as in taste or colour, some being ovall or Peare
fashion or Almond like, or sphericall or round, some firme, some soft and waterish,
some sweete, some sower or harsh, or differing from all these tastes: and some white,
others blacke, some red, others yellow, some purple, others blew, as they shall bee
briefly set downe vnto you in the following lines, where I meane not to insert any the
wilde or hedge fruit, but those only are fit for an Orchard, to be stored with good fruit:
and of all which sorts, the choysest for goodnesse, and rarest for knowledge, are to
be had of my very good friend Master Iohn Tradescante, who hath wonderfully laboured
to obtaine all the rarest fruits hee can heare off in any place of Christendome,
Turky, yea or the whole world; as also with Master Iohn Millen, dwelling in Olde
streete, who from Iohn Tradescante and all others that haue had good fruit, hath stored
himselfe with the best only, and he can sufficiently furnish any.</p>

<p>The Amber Primordian Plumme is an indifferent faire Plumme, early ripe, of a pale
yellowish colour, and of a waterish taste, not pleasing.</p>

<p>The red Primordian Plumme is of a reasonable size, long and round, reddish on
the outside, of a more dry taste, and ripe with the first sorts in the beginning of August.</p>

<p>The blew Primordian is a small plumme, almost like the Damascene, and is subiect
to drop off from the tree before it be ripe.</p>

<p>The white Date Plum is no very good plum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_576">[576]</a></span></p>

<p>The red Date plumme is a great long red pointed plumme, and late ripe, little better
then the white.</p>

<p>The blacke Mussell plumme is a good plumme, reasonable drye, and tasteth well.</p>

<p>The red Mussell Plumme is somewhat flat as well as round, of a very good taste, and
is ripe about the middle of August.</p>

<p>The Pruneola plum is a small white plum, of a fine tart taste: it was wont to bee vsually
brought ouer in small round boxes, and sold most commonly at the Comfitmakers,
(cut in twaine, the stone cast away) at a very deere rate: the tree groweth and
beareth well with vs.</p>

<p>The Shepway Bulleis is of a darke blewish brown colour, of a larger size then the
ordinary, and of a sharpe taste, but not so good as the common.</p>

<p>The white and the blacke Bulleis are common in most Countries, being small round
plums, lesser then Damsons, sharper in taste, and later ripe.</p>

<p>The Flushing Bulleis groweth with his fruite thicke clustring together like grapes.</p>

<p>The Christian plum, called also the Nutmeg plum; the tree groweth very shrubby,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>and will abide good for six weekes at the least after it is gathered, and after all other
plums are spent.</p>

<p>The Cherry plum remembred before, speaking of the Muscadine plum, is a very
good plum, but small.</p>

<p>The Amber plum is a round plum, as yellow on the outside almost as yellow waxe,
of a sowre vnpleasant taste that which I tasted, but I thinke it was not the right; for I
haue seene and tasted another of the same bignesse, of a paler colour, farre better rellished,
and a firmer substance, comming cleane from the stone like an Apricocke.</p>

<p>The Apricocke plum is a good plum when it is in its perfection, but that is seldome;
for it doth most vsually cracke, thereby diminishing much of its goodnesse, and besides
yeeldeth gumme at the crackes.</p>

<p>The Eason plum is a little red plum, but very good in taste.</p>

<p>The Violet plum is a small and long blackish blew plum, ripe about Bartholmew
tide, a very good dry eating fruit.</p>

<p>The Grape plum is the Flushing Bulleis before remembred.</p>

<p>The Dennie plum is called also the Cheston, or the Friars plum before remembred.</p>

<p>The Damaske Violet plum, or Queen mother plum spoken of before.</p>

<p>The blacke Damascene plum is a very good dry plum, and of a darke blew colour
when it is ripe.</p>

<p>The white Damson is nothing so well rellished as the other.</p>

<p>The great Damson or Damaske plum is greater then the ordinary Damson, and
sweeter in taste.</p>

<p>The blew Damson well knowne, a good fruit.</p>

<p>The Coserers plum is flat, like vnto a Peare plum, it is early ripe and blacke, of a
very good rellish.</p>

<p>The Margate plum the worst of an hundred.</p>

<p>The green Oysterly plum is a reasonable great plum, of a whitish green colour when
it is ripe, of a moist and sweete taste, reasonable good.</p>

<p>The red Mirobalane plum groweth to be a great tree quickly, spreading very thicke
and farre, very like the blacke Thorne or Sloe bush: the fruit is red, earlier ripe, and
of a better taste then the white.</p>

<p>The white Mirobalane plum is in most things like the former red, but the fruit is of
a whitish yellow colour, and very pleasant, especially if it be not ouer ripe: both these
had need to be plashed against a wall, or else they will hardly beare ripe fruit.</p>

<p>The Oliue plum is very like a greene Oliue, but for colour and bignesse, and groweth
lowe on a small bushing tree, and ripeneth late, but is the best of all the sorts of
greene plums.</p>

<p>The white diapred plum of Malta, scarce knowne to any in our Land but Iohn Tradescante,
is a very good plum, and striped all ouer like diaper, and thereby so called.</p>

<p>The blacke diapred plum is like the Damascene plum, being blacke with spots, as
small as pins points vpon it, of a very good rellish.</p>

<p>The Peake plum is a long whitish plum, and very good.</p>

<p>The Pishamin or Virginia plum is called a plum, but vtterly differeth from all sorts
of plums, the description whereof may truely enforme you, as it is set downe in the
<a href="#Chap_6_Xa" title="go to Virginia plum in Orchard chapter 10">tenth Chapter going before</a>, whereunto I referre you.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Plums.</h4>

<p>The great Damaske or Damson Plummes are dryed in France in great
quantities, and brought ouer vnto vs in Hogs-heads, and other great vessels,
and are those Prunes that are vsually sold at the Grocers, vnder the
name of Damaske Prunes: the blacke Bulleis also are those (being dryed in
the same manner) that they call French Prunes, and by their tartnesse are
thought to binde, as the other, being sweet, to loosen the body.</p>

<p>The Bruneola Plumme, by reason of his pleasant tartnesse, is much accounted
of, and being dryed, the stones taken from them, are brought ouer
to vs in small boxes, and sold deere at the Comfitmakers, where they very
often accompany all sorts of banquetting stuffes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_579">[579]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of these Plums, because of their firmnesse, are vndoubtedly more
wholsome then others that are sweete and waterish, and cause lesse offence
in their stomackes that eate them; and therefore are preserued with Sugar,
to be kept all the yeare. None of them all is vsed in medicines so much as
the great Damson or Damaske Prune, although all of them for the most
part doe coole, lenifie, and draw forth choller, and thereby are fittest to be
vsed of such as haue chollericke Agues.</p>

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e Apricocke (as I said) is without question a kinde of Plumme, rather then a
Peach, both the flower being white, and the stone of the fruit smooth also, like
a Plumme, and yet because of the excellencie of the fruit, and the difference
therein from all other Plummes, I haue thought it meete to entreate thereof by it selfe,
and shew you the varieties haue been obserued in these times.</p>

<p>The Apricocke tree riseth vp to a very great height, either standing by it selfe
(where it beareth not so kindly, and very little in our country) or planted against a
wall, as it is most vsuall, hauing a great stemme or body, and likewise many great armes
or branches, couered with a smooth barke: the leaues are large, broad, and almost
round, but pointed at the ends, and finely dented about the edges: the flowers are
white, as the Plumme tree blossomes, but somewhat larger, and rounder set: the fruit
is round, with a cleft on the one side, somewhat like vnto a Peach, being of a yellowish
colour as well on the inside as outside, of a firme or fast substance, and dry, not ouermoist
in the eating, and very pleasant in taste, containing within it a broad and flat
stone, somewhat round and smooth, not rugged as the Peach stone, with a pleasant
sweete kernell (yet some haue reported, that there is such as haue their kernels bitter,
which I did neuer see or know) and is ripe almost with our first or earliest Plummes,
and thereof it tooke the name of <i>Præcox</i>; and it may bee was the earliest of all others
was then knowne, when that name was giuen.</p>

<p>The great Apricocke, which some call the long Apricocke, is the greatest and fairest
of all the rest.</p>

<p>The smaller Apricocke, which some call the small round Apricocke, is thought to
be small, because it first sprang from a stone: but that is not so; for the kinde it selfe
being inoculated, will bee alwaies small, and neuer halfe so faire and great as the
former.</p>

<p>The white Apricocke hath his leaues more folded together, as if it were halfe double:
it beareth but seldome, and very few, which differ not from the ordinary, but in
being more white, without any red when it is ripe.</p>

<p>The Mascoline Apricocke hath a finer greene leafe, and thinner then the former, and
beareth very seldome any store of fruit, which differeth in nothing from the first, but
that it is a little more delicate.</p>

<p>The long Mascoline Apricocke hath his fruit growing a little longer then the former,
and differeth in nothing else.</p>

<p>The Argier Apricocke is a smaller fruit then any of the other, and yellow, but as
sweete and delicate as any of them, hauing a blackish stone within it, little bigger then
a Lacure Cherry stone: this with many other sorts Iohn Tradescante brought with
him returning from the Argier voyage, whither hee went voluntary with the Fleete,
that went against the Pyrates in the yeare 1620.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Apricockes.</h4>

<p>Apricockes are eaten oftentimes in the same manner that other dainty
Plummes are, betweene meales of themselues, or among other fruit at
banquets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_580">[580]</a></span></p>

<p>They are also preserued and candid, as it pleaseth Gentlewomen to bestowe
their time and charge, or the Comfitmaker to sort among other candid
fruits.</p>

<p>Some likewise dry them, like vnto Peares, Apples, Damsons, and other
Plummes.</p>

<p>Matthiolus doth wonderfully commend the oyle drawne from the kernels
of the stones, to annoint the inflamed <i>hæmorrhoides</i> or piles, the swellings
of vlcers, the roughnesse of the tongue and throate, and likewise the
paines of the eares.</p>

<p>As I ordered the Cherries and Plummes, so I intend to deale with Peaches, because
their varieties are many, and more knowne in these dayes then in former
times: but because the Nectorin is a differing kinde of Peach, I must deale
with it as I did with the Apricocke among the Plummes, that is, place it in a <a href="#Chap_6_XVI" title="go to Orchard chapter 16">Chapter
by it selfe</a>.</p>

<p>The Peach tree of it selfe groweth not vsually altogether so great, or high as the Apricocke,
because it is lesse durable, but yet spreadeth with faire great branches, from
whence spring smaller and slenderer reddish twigges, whereon are set long narrow
greene leaues, dented about the edges: the blossomes are greater then of any Plumme,
of a deepe blush or light purple colour: after which commeth the fruit, which is round,
and sometimes as great as a reasonable Apple or Pippin (I speake of some sorts; for
there be some kindes that are much smaller) with a furrow or cleft on the one side, and
couered with a freese or cotton on the outside, of colour either russet, or red, or yellow,
or of a blackish red colour; of differing substances and tastes also, some being
firme, others waterish, some cleauing fast to the stone on the inside, others parting
from it more or lesse easily, one excelling another very farre, wherein is contained a
rugged stone, with many chinkes or clefts in it, the kernell whereof is bitter: the roots
growe neither deepe nor farre; and therefore are subiect to the winds, standing alone,
and not against a wall. It sooner waxeth old and decayeth, being sprung of a stone,
then being inoculated on a Plumme stocke, whereby it is more durable.</p>

<p>The great white Peach is white on the outside as the meate is also, and is a good well
rellished fruit.</p>

<p>The small white Peach is all one with the greater, but differeth in size.</p>

<p>The Carnation Peach is of three sorts, two are round, and the third long; they are
all of a whitish colour, shadowed ouer with red, and more red on the side is next the
sunne: the lesser round is the more common, and the later ripe.</p>

<p>The grand Carnation Peach is like the former round Peach, but greater, and is as
late ripe, that is, in the beginning of September.</p>

<p>The red Peach is an exceeding well rellished fruit.</p>

<p>The russet Peach is one of the most ordinary Peaches in the Kingdome, being of a
russet colour on the outside, and but of a reasonable rellish, farre meaner then many
other.</p>

<p>The Island Peach is a faire Peach, and of a very good rellish.</p>

<p>The Newington Peach is a very good Peach, and of an excellent good rellish, being
of a whitish greene colour on the outside, yet halfe reddish, and is ripe about Bartholmew
tide.</p>

<p>The yellow Peach is of a deepe yellow colour; there be hereof diuers sorts, some
good and some bad.</p>

<p>The St. Iames Peach is the same with the Queenes Peach, here belowe set downe,
although some would make them differing.</p>

<p>The Melocotone Peach is a yellow faire Peach, but differing from the former yellow
both in forme and taste, in that this hath a small crooked end or point for the most
part, it is ripe before them, and better rellished then any of them.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
early ripe, and is another kinde of Nutmeg Peach.</p>

<p>The Queenes Peach is a faire great yellowish browne Peach, shadowed as it were
ouer with deepe red, and is ripe at Bartholmew tide, of a very pleasant good taste.</p>

<p>The Romane Peach is a very good Peach, and well rellished.</p>

<p>The Durasme or Spanish Peach is of a darke yellowish red colour on the outside,

it is of a waterish taste, and late ripe.</p>

<p>The Alberza Peach is late ripe, and of a reasonable good taste.</p>

<p>The Almond Peach, so called, because the kernell of the stone is sweete, like the Almond,
and the fruit also somewhat pointed like the Almond in the huske; it is early
ripe, and like the Newington Peach, but lesser.</p>

<p>The Man Peach is of two sorts, the one longer then the other, both of them are good
Peaches, but the shorter is the better rellished.</p>

<p>The Cherry Peach is a small Peach, but well tasted.</p>

<p>The Nutmeg Peach is of two sorts, one that will be hard when it is ripe, and eateth
not so pleasantly as the other, which will bee soft and mellow; they are both small
Peaches, hauing very little or no resemblance at all to a Nutmeg, except in being a
little longer then round, and are early ripe.</p>

<p>Many other sorts of Peaches there are, whereunto wee can giue no especiall name;
and therefore I passe them ouer in silence.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Peaches.</h4>

<p>Those Peaches that are very moist and waterish (as many of them are)
and not firme, doe soone putrefie in the stomacke, causing surfeits oftentimes;
and therefore euery one had neede bee carefull, what and in what
manner they eate them: yet they are much and often well accepted with all
the Gentry of the Kingdome.</p>

<p>The leaues, because of their bitternesse, serue well being boyled in Ale
or Milke, to be giuen vnto children that haue wormes, to help to kill them,
and doe gently open the belly, if there be a sufficient quantity vsed.</p>

<p>The flowers haue the like operation, that is, to purge the body somewhat
more forceably then Damaske Roses; a Syrupe therefore made of the flowers
is very good.</p>

<p>The kernels of the Peach stones are oftentimes vsed to be giuen to them
that cannot well make water, or are troubled with the stone; for it openeth
the stoppings of the vritory passages, whereby much ease ensueth.</p>

  <span class="line sub-title">Nectorins.</span>
</h3>

<p>I presume that the name <i>Nucipersica</i> doth most rightly belong vnto that kinde of
Peach, which we call Nectorins, and although they haue beene with vs not many
yeares, yet haue they beene knowne both in Italy to Matthiolus, and others before
him, who it seemeth knew no other then the yellow Nectorin, as Dalechampius also:
But we at this day doe know fiue seuerall sorts of Nectorins, as they shall be presently
set downe; and as in the former fruits, so in this, I will giue you the description of one,
and briefe notes of the rest.</p>

<p>The Nectorin is a tree of no great bignesse, most vsually lesser then the Peach tree,
his body and elder boughes being whitish, the younger branches very red, whereon
grow narrow long greene leaues, so like vnto Peach leaues, that none can well distinguish
them, vnlesse it be in this, that they are somewhat lesser; the blossomes are all
reddish, as the Peach, but one of a differing fashion from all the other, as I shall shew
you by and by: the fruit that followeth is smaller, rounder, and smoother then Peaches,
without any cleft on the side, and without any douny cotton or freeze at all; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
herein is like vnto the outer greene rinde of the Wallnut, whereof as I am perswaded it
tooke the name, of a fast and firme meate, and very delicate in taste, especially the best
kindes, with a rugged stone within it, and a bitter kernell.</p>

<p>The Muske Nectorin, so called, because it being a kinde of the best red Nectorins,
both smelleth and eateth as if the fruit were steeped in Muske: some thinke that this
and the next Romane Nectorin are all one.</p>

<p>The Romane red Nectorin, or cluster Nectorin, hath a large or great purplish blossome,
like vnto a Peach, reddish at the bottome on the outside, and greenish within:
the fruit is of a fine red colour on the outside, and groweth in clusters, two or three at
a ioynt together, of an excellent good taste.</p>

<p>The bastard red Nectorin hath a smaller or pincking blossome, more like threads
then leaues, neither so large nor open as the former, and yellowish within at the bottome:
the fruit is red on the outside, and groweth neuer but one at a ioynt; it is a good
fruit, but eateth a little more rawish then the other, euen when it is full ripe.</p>

<p>The yellow Nectorin is of two sorts, the one an excellent fruit, mellow, and of a
very good rellish; the other hard, and no way comparable to it.</p>

<p>The greene Nectorin, great and small; for such I haue seene abiding constant, although
both planted in one ground: they are both of one goodnesse, and accounted
with most to be the best rellished Nectorin of all others.</p>

<p>The white Nectorin is said to bee differing from the other, in that it will bee more
white on the outside when it is ripe, then either the yellow or greene: but I haue not
yet seene it.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e Almond also may be reckoned vnto the stock or kindred of the Peaches, it
is so like both in leafe and blossome, and somewhat also in the fruit, for the outward
forme, although it hath onely a dry skinne, and no pulpe or meate to bee
eaten: but the kernell of the stone or shell, which is called the Almond, maketh recompense
of that defect, whereof some are sweete, some bitter, some great, some
small, some long, and some short.</p>

<p>The Almond tree groweth vpright, higher and greater then any Peach; and is
therefore vsually planted by it selfe, and not against a wall, whose body sometime exceedeth
any mans fadome, whereby it sheweth to be of longer continuance, bearing
large armes, and smaller branches also, but brittle, whereon are set long and narrow
leaues, like vnto the Peach tree: the blossomes are purplish, like vnto Peach blossoms,
but paler: the fruit is somewhat like a Peach for the forme of the skinne or outside,
which is rough, but not with any such cleft therein, or with any pulpe or meate fit
to bee eaten, but is a thicke dry skinne when it is ripe, couering the stone or shell,
which is smooth and not rugged, and is either long and great, or small, or thicke and
short, according as the nut or kernell within it is, which is sweete both in the greater
and smaller, and onely one smaller kinde which is bitter: yet this I haue obserued, that
all the Almond trees that I haue seene growe in England, both of the sweete and bitter
kindes, beare Almonds thicke and short, and not long, as that sort which is called
the Iorden Almond.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Almonds.</h4>

<p>They are vsed many ways, and for many purposes, either eaten alone
with Figges, or Raysins of the Sunne, or made into paste with Sugar and
Rosewater for Marchpanes, or put among Floure, Egges, and Sugar, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
make Mackerons, or crusted ouer with Sugar, to make Comfits, or mixed
with Rosewater and Sugar, to make Butter, or with Barley water, to make
Milke, and many other waies, as euery one list, that hath skill in such things.</p>

<p>The oyle also of Almonds is vsed many waies, both inwardly and outwardly,
for many purposes; as the oyle of sweete Almonds mixt with
poudered white Sugar Candy, for coughes and hoarsenesse, and to be drunk
alone, or with some other thing (as the Syrupe of Marsh Mallowes) for the
stone, to open and lenifie the passages, and make them slipperie, that the
stone may passe the easier. And also for women in Child bed after their sore
trauell. And outwardly either by it selfe, or with oyle of Tartar to make a
creame, to lenifie the skin, parched with the winde or otherwise, or to annoint
the stomacke either alone, or with other things to helpe a cold.</p>

<p>The oyle of bitter Almonds is much vsed to be dropped into their eares
that are hard of hearing, to helpe to open them. And as it is thought, doth
more scoure and cleanse the skin then the sweet oyle doth, and is therefore
more vsed of many for that purpose, as the Almonds themselues are.</p>

  <span class="line sub-title">Orenges.</span>
</h3>

<p>I bring here to your consideration, as you see, the Orenge tree alone, without mentioning
the Citron or Lemmon trees, in regard of the experience we haue seen made
of them in diuers places: For the Orenge tree hath abiden with some extraordinary
looking and tending of it, when as neither of the other would by any meanes
be preserued any long time. If therefore any be desirous to keepe this tree, he must so
prouide for it, that it be preserued from any cold, either in the winter or spring, and
exposed to the comfort of the sunne in summer. And for that purpose some keepe
them in great square boxes, and lift them to and fro by iron hooks on the sides, or cause
them to be rowled by trundels, or small wheels vnder them, to place them in an house,
or close gallerie for the winter time: others plant them against a bricke wall in the
ground, and defend them by a shed of boardes, couered ouer with seare-cloth in the
winter, and by the warmth of a stoue, or other such thing, giue them some comfort in
the colder times: but no tent or meane prouision will preserue them.</p>

<p>The Orenge tree in the warme Countries groweth very high, but with vs (or else it
is a dwarfe kinde thereof) riseth not very high: the barke of the elder stemmes being
of a darke colour, and the young branches very greene, whereon grow here and there
some few thornes: the leaues are faire, large, and very greene, in forme almost like a
Bay leafe, but that it hath a small eare, or peece of a leafe, fashioned like vnto an heart
vnder euery one of them, with many small holes to be seene in them, if you hold them
vp betweene you and the light, of a sweet but strong smell, naturally not falling away,
but alwaies abiding on, or vntill new be come vp, bearing greene leaues continually:
the flowers are whitish, of a very strong and heady sent; after which come small round
fruit, greene at the first, while they are small, and not neere maturitie, but being grown
and ripe, are (as all men know) red on the out side, some more pale then others, and
some kindes of a deeper yellowish red, according to the climate, and as it receiueth the
heate of the sunne, wherein is contained sower or sweete iuice, and thicke white kernels
among it: it beareth in the warme Countries both blossomes and greene fruit
continually vpon it, and ripe fruit also with them for the best part of the yeare, but especially
in Autumne and Winter.</p>

<p>Orenges are vsed as sawce for many sorts of meates, in respect of their
sweete sowernesse, giuing a rellish of delight, whereinsoeuer they are vsed.</p>

<p>The inner pulpe or iuice doth serue in agues and hot diseases, and in Summer
to coole the heate of deiected stomackes, or fainting spirits.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
<p>The dryed rinde, by reason of the sweete and strong sent, serueth to bee
put among other things to make sweet pouthers.</p>

<p>The outer rindes, when they are clensed from all the inner pulpe and
skins, are preserued in Sugar, after the bitternesse by often steepings hath
been taken away, &amp; do serue either as Succots, and banquetting stuffes, or as
ornaments to set out dishes for the table, or to giue a rellish vnto meats,
whether baked or boyled: Physically they helpe to warme a cold stomack,
and to digest or breake winde therein: or they are candid with Sugar, and
serue with other dryed Iunquets.</p>

<p>The water of Orange flowers is oftentimes vsed as a great perfume for
gloues, to washe them, or in stead of Rose-water to mixe with other things.</p>

<p>It is vsed to bee drunke by some, to preuent or to helpe any pestilentiall
feuer.</p>

<p>The oyntment that is made of the flowers, is very comfortable both
for the stomache, against the could or cough, or for the head, for paines and
disinesse.</p>

<p>The kernels or seede beeing cast into the ground in the spring time, will
quickely grow vp, (but will not abide the winter with vs, to bee kept for
growing trees) and when they are of a finger length high, being pluckt vp,
and put among sallets, will giue them a maruellous fine aromaticke or spicy
taste, very acceptable.</p>

<p>The seed or kernels are a little cordiall, although nothing so much as the
kernels of the Pomecitron.</p>

  <span class="line sub-title">Apples.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>e sorts of Apples are so many, and infinite almost as I may say, that I cannot
giue you the names of all, though I haue endeauoured to giue a great many,
and I thinke it almost impossible for any one, to attaine to the full perfection of
knowledge herein, not onely in regard of the multiplicitie of fashions, colours and
tastes, but in that some are more familiar to one Countrey then to another, being of a
better or worse taste in one place then in another, and therefore diuersly called: I will
therefore as I haue done before, giue you the description of the Tree in generall, as also
of the Paradise or dwarfe Apple, because of some especiall difference, and afterwards
the names of as many, with their fashions, as haue come to my knowledge, either by
sight or relation: for I doe confesse I haue not seene all that I here set downe, but vse
the helpe of some friends, and therefore if it happen that the seuerall names doe not
answer vnto seuerall sorts, but that the same fruit may bee called by one name in one
Country, that is called by another elsewhere, excuse it I pray you; for in such a number,
such a fault may escape vnknowne.</p>

<p>The Apple tree for the most part is neyther very high, great or straight, but rather
vsually boweth and spreadeth (although in some places it groweth fairer and straighter
then in others) hauing long and great armes or boughes, and from them smaller branches,
whereon doe grow somewhat broade, and long greene leaues, nicked about the
edges: the flowers are large and white, with blush coloured sides, consisting of fiue
leaues: the fruit (as I said) is of diuers formes, colours and tastes, and likewise of a very
variable durabilitie; for some must be eaten presently after they are gathered, and they
are for the most part the earliest ripe; others will abide longer vpon the trees, before
they bee fit to be gathered; some also will be so hard when others are gathered, that
they will not be fit to be eaten, for one, two or three months after they bee gathered;
and some will abide good but one, two or three moneths, and no more; and some will
be best, after a quarter or halfe a yeares lying, vnto the end of that yeare or the next.</p>

<p>The Paradise or dwarfe Apple tree groweth nothing so high as the former, and many
times not much higher then a man may reach, hauing leaues and flowers altogether
like the other, the fruit is a faire yellow Apple, and reasonable great, but very light and
spongy or loose, and of a bitterish sweet taste, nothing pleasant. And these faults al<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>so
are incident vnto this tree, that both bodie and branches are much subiect vnto
cancker, which will quickely eate it round, and kill it; besides it will haue many bunches,
or tuberous swellings in many places, which grow as it were scabby or rough,
and will soone cause it to perish: the roote sendeth forth many shootes and suckers,
whereby it may be much increased. But this benefit may be had of it, to recompence
the former faults, That being a dwarfe Tree, whatsoeuer fruit shall be grafted on it,
will keepe the graft low like vnto it selfe, and yet beare fruit reasonable well. And this
is a pretty way to haue Pippins, Pomewaters, or any other sort of Apples (as I haue,
had my selfe, and also seene with others) growing low, that if any will, they may make a
hedge rowe of these low fruits, planted in an Orchard all along by a walke side: but
take this Caueat, if you will auoide the danger of the cancker and knots, which spoile
the tree, to graft it hard vnto the ground, that therby you may giue as little of the nature
of the stock thereunto as possibly you can, which wil vndoubtedly help it very much.</p>

<h4>The kindes or sorts of Apples.</h4>

<p>The Summer pippin is a very good apple first ripe, and therefore to bee first
spent, because it will not abide so long as the other.</p>

<p>The French pippin is also a good fruit and yellow.</p>

<p>The Golding pippin is the greatest and best of all sorts of pippins.</p>

<p>The Russet pippin is as good an apple as most of the other sorts of pippins.</p>

<p>The spotted pippin is the most durable pippin of all the other sorts.</p>

<p>The ordinary yellow pippin is like the other, and as good; for indeed I know
no sort of pippins but are excellent good well rellished fruites.</p>

<p>The great pearemaine differeth little either in taste or durabilitie from the
pippin, and therefore next vnto it is accounted the best of all apples.</p>

<p>The summer pearemaine is of equall goodnesse with the former, or rather a little
more pleasing, especially for the time of its eating, which will not bee so long lasting,
but is spent and gone when the other beginneth to be good to eate.</p>

<p>The Russetting is also a firme and a very good apple, not so waterish as the pippin or
pearemaine, and will last the best part of the year, but will be very mellow at the last, or
rather halfe dryed.</p>

<p>The Broading is a very good apple.</p>

<p>The Pomewater is an excellent good and great whitish apple, full of sap or moisture,
somewhat pleasant sharpe, but a little bitter withall: it will not last long, the winter
frosts soone causing it to rot, and perish.</p>

<p>The Flower of Kent is a faire yellowish greene apple both good and great.</p>

<p>The Gilloflower apple is a fine apple, and finely spotted.</p>

<p>The Marligo is the same, that is called the Marigold apple, it is a middle sized apple,
very yellow on the outside, shadowed ouer as it were with red, and more red on one
side, a reasonable well rellished fruit.</p>

<p>The Blandrill is a good apple.</p>

<p>The Dauie Gentle is a very good apple.</p>

<p>The Gruntlin is somewhat a long apple, smaller at the crowne then at the stalke, and
is a reasonable good apple.</p>

<p>The gray Costerd is a good great apple, somewhat whitish on the outside, and abideth
the winter.</p>

<p>The greene Costerd is like the other, but greener on the outside continually.</p>

<p>The Haruy apple is a faire great goodly apple, and very well rellished.</p>

<p>The Dowse apple is a sweetish apple not much accounted of.</p>

<p>The Pome-paris is a very good apple.</p>

<p>The Belle boon of two sorts winter and summer, both of them good apples, and fair
fruit to look on, being yellow and of a meane bignesse.</p>

<p>The pound Royall is a very great apple, of a very good and sharpe taste.</p>

<p>The Doues Bill a small apple.</p>

<p>The Deusan or apple Iohn is a delicate fine fruit, well rellished when it beginneth to
be fit to be eaten, and endureth good longer then any other apple.</p>

<p>The Master William is greater then a pippin, but of no very good rellish.</p>

<p>The Master Iohn is a better tasted apple then the other by much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_588">[588]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spicing is a well tasted fruite.</p>

<p class="postbracket">The Queene apple is of two sorts, both of them great faire red apples, and well rellished,
but the greater is the best.</p>

<p>The Bastard Queene apple is like the other for forme and colour, but not so good in
taste: some call this the bardfield Queening.</p>

<p>The Boughton or greening is a very good and well tasted apple.</p>

<p>The Leather coate apple is a good winter apple, of no great bignesse, but of a very
good and sharpe taste.</p>

<p>The Pot apple is a plaine Country apple.</p>

<p>The Cowsnout is no very good fruit.</p>

<p>The Gildiling apple is a yellow one, not much accounted.</p>

<p>The Cats head apple tooke the name of the likenesse, and is a reasonable good apple
and great.</p>

<p>The Kentish Codlin is a faire great greenish apple, very good to eate when it is ripe;
but the best to coddle of all other apples.</p>

<p>The Stoken apple is a reasonable good apple.</p>

<p>The Geneting apple is a very pleasant and good apple.</p>

<p>The Worcester apple is a very good apple, as bigge as a Pomewater.</p>

<p><i>Donime Couadis</i> is a French apple, and of a good rellish.</p>

<p>The French Goodwin is a very good apple.</p>

<p>The old wife is a very good, and well rellished apple.</p>

<p>The towne Crab is an hard apple, not so good to be eaten rawe as roasted, but excellent
to make Cider.</p>

<p>The Virgilling apple is a reasonable good apple.</p>

<p>The Crowes egge is no good rellished fruit, but noursed vp in some places of the
common people.</p>

<p>The Sugar apple is so called of the sweetnesse.</p>

<p>Sops in wine is so named both of the pleasantnesse of the fruit, and beautie of the
apple.</p>

<p>The womans breast apple is a great apple.</p>

<p>The blacke apple or pippin is a very good eating apple, and very like a Pearemaine,
both for forme and bignesse, but of a blacke sooty colour.</p>

<p>Tweenty sorts of Sweetings and none good.</p>

<p>The Peare apple is a small fruit, but well rellished being ripe, and is for shape very
like vnto a small short Peare, and greene.</p>

<p>The Paradise apple is a faire goodly yellow apple, but light and spongy, and of a bitterish
sweet taste, not to be commended.</p>

<p>The apple without blossome, so called because although it haue a small shew of a
blossome, yet they are but small threds rather then leaues, neuer shewing to bee like a
flower, and therefore termed without blossome: the apple is neyther good eating nor
baking fruit.</p>

<p>Wildings and Crabs are without number or vse in our Orchard, being to be had out
of the woods, fields and hedges rather then any where else.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Apples.</h4>

<p>The best sorts of Apples serue at the last course for the table, in most
mens houses of account, where, if there grow any rare or excellent fruit, it
is then set forth to be seene and tasted.</p>

<p>Diuers other sorts serue to bake, either for the Masters Table, or the
meynes sustenance, either in pyes or pans, or else stewed in dishes with Rosewater
and Sugar, and Cinamon or Ginger cast vpon.</p>

<p>Some kinds are fittest to roast in the winter time, to warme a cup of wine,
ale or beere; or to be eaten alone, for the nature of some fruit is neuer so
good, or worth the eating, as when they are roasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_589">[589]</a></span></p>

<p>Some sorts are fittest to scald for Codlins, and are taken to coole the stomacke,
as well as to please the taste, hauing Rosewater and Sugar put to
them.</p>

<p>Some sorts are best to make Cider of, as in the West Countrey of England
great quantities, yea many Hogsheads and Tunnes full are made, especially
to bee carried to the Sea in long voyages, and is found by experience
to bee of excellent vse, to mixe with water for beuerage. It is vsually seene
that those fruits that are neither fit to eate raw, roasted, nor baked, are fittest
for Cider, and make the best.</p>

<p>The iuice of Apples likewise, as of pippins, and pearemaines, is of very
good vse in Melancholicke diseases, helping to procure mirth, and to expell
heauinesse.</p>

<p>The distilled water of the same Apples is of the like effect.</p>

<p>There is a fine sweet oyntment made of Apples called <i>Pomatum</i>, which is
much vsed to helpe chapt lips, or hands, or for the face, or any other part of
the skinne that is rough with winde, or any other accident, to supple them,
and make them smooth.</p>

</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">W<span class="looks_big">e</span>e haue some diuersities of Quinces, although not many, yet more then
our elder times were acquainted with, which shall be here expressed.</p>

<p>The Quince tree groweth oftentimes to the height and bignesse of a
good Apple tree, but more vsually lower, with crooked and spreading armes and
branches farre abroad, the leaues are somewhat round, and like the leaues of the Apple
tree, but thicker, harder, fuller of veines, and white on the vnderside: the blossomes
or flowers are white, now and then dasht ouer with blush, being large and open,
like vnto a single Rose: the fruit followeth, which when it is ripe is yellow, and couered
with a white cotton or freeze, which in the younger is thicker and more plentifull,
but waxeth lesse and lesse, as the fruit ripeneth, being bunched out many times in
seuerall places, and round, especially about the head, some greater, others smaller,
some round like an Apple, others long like a Peare, of a strong heady sent, accounted
not wholsome or long to be endured, and of no durabilitie to keepe, in the middle
whereof is a core, with many blackish seedes or kernels therein, lying close together
in cels, and compassed with a kinde of cleare gelly, which is easier seene in the scalded
fruit, then in the raw.</p>

<p>The English Quince is the ordinarie Apple Quince, set downe before, and is of so
harsh a taste being greene, that no man can endure to eate it rawe, but eyther boyled,
stewed, roasted or baked; all which waies it is very good.</p>

<p>The Portingall Apple Quince is a great yellow Quince, seldome comming to bee
whole and faire without chapping; this is so pleasant being fresh gathered, that it may
be eaten like vnto an Apple without offence.</p>

<p>The Portingall Peare Quince is not fit to be eaten rawe like the former, but must be
vsed after some of the waies the English Quince is appointed, and so it will make more
dainty dishes then the English, because it is lesse harsh, will bee more tender, and take
lesse sugar for the ordering then the English kinde.</p>

<p>The Barbary Quince is like in goodnesse vnto the Portingall Quince last spoken of,
but lesser in bignesse.</p>

<p>The Lyons Quince.</p>

<p>The Brunswicke Quince.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Quinces.</h4>

<p>There is no fruit growing in this Land that is of so many excellent vses
as this, seruing as well to make many dishes of meate for the table, as for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
banquets, and much more for the Physicall vertues, whereof to write at
large is neither conuenient for mee, nor for this worke: I will onely briefly
recite some, as it were to giue you a taste of that plenty remaineth therein,
to bee conuerted into sundry formes: as first for the table, while they are
fresh (and all the yeare long after being pickled vp) to be baked, as a dainty
dish, being well and orderly cookt. And being preserued whole in Sugar,
either white or red, serue likewise, not onely as an after dish to close vp the
stomacke, but is placed among other Preserues by Ladies and Gentlewomen,
and bestowed on their friends to entertaine them, and among other
sorts of Preserues at Banquets. Codimacke also and Marmilade, Ielly and
Paste, are all made of Quinces, chiefly for delight and pleasure, although
they haue also with them some physicall properties.</p>

<p>We haue for the vse of physicke, both Iuyce and Syrupe, both Conserue
and Condite, both binding and loosening medicines, both inward and outward,
and all made of Quinces.</p>

<p>The Ielly or Muccilage of the seedes, is often vsed to be laid vpon womens

<p><cite>Athenæus reciteth in his third booke</cite>, that one Philarchus found, that
the smell of Quinces tooke away the strength of a certaine poison, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phariacum</i>. And the Spaniards haue also found, that the strength of the
iuyce of white Ellebor (which the Hunters vse as a poyson to dippe their
arrow heads in, that they shoote at wilde beasts to kill them) is quite
taken away, if it stand within the compasse of the smell of Quinces.
And also that Grapes, being hung vp to bee kept, and spent in Winter,
doe quickly rot with the smell of a Quince.</p>

aboue, and whiter vnderneath then those of the apple tree: the flowers are whiter and
greater: the fruit is longer then round for the most part, smaller at the stalke, and greater
at the head, of so many differing formes, colours, and tastes, that hardly can one
distinguish rightly between them, the times also being as variable in the gathering and

<h4>The kindes of Peares.</h4>

<p>The Summer bon Chretien is somewhat a long peare, with a greene and yellow
russetish coate, and will haue sometimes red sides; it is ripe at Michaelmas: some vse
to dry them as they doe Prunes, and keepe them all the yeare after. I haue not seene
or heard any more Summer kindes hereof then this one, and needeth no wall to nourse
it as the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_592">[592]</a></span></p>

<p>The Winter bon Chretien is of many sorts, some greater, others lesser, and all good;
but the greatest and best is that kinde that groweth at Syon: All the kinds of this Winter
fruit must be planted against a wall, or else they will both seldome beare, and bring
fewer also to ripenesse, comparable to the wall fruit: the kindes also are according to
their lasting; for some will endure good much longer then others.</p>

<p>The Summer Bergomot is an excellent well rellished peare, flattish, &amp; short, not long
like others, of a meane bignesse, and of a darke yellowish greene colour on the outside.</p>

<p>The Winter Bergomot is of two or three sorts, being all of them small fruit, somewhat
greener on the outside then the Summer kindes; all of them very delicate and
good in their due time: for some will not be fit to bee eaten when others are well-nigh
spent, euery of them outlasting another by a moneth or more.</p>

<p>The Diego peare is but a small peare, but an excellent well rellished fruit, tasting as
if Muske had been put among it; many of them growe together, as it were in clusters.</p>

<p>The Duetete or double headed peare, so called of the forme, is a very good peare,
not very great, of a russettish browne colour on the outside.</p>

<p>The Primating peare is a good moist peare, and early ripe.</p>

<p>The Geneting peare is a very good early ripe peare.</p>

<p>The greene Chesill is a delicate mellow peare, euen melting as it were in the mouth
of the eater, although greenish on the outside.</p>

<p>The Catherine peare is knowne to all I thinke to be a yellow red sided peare, of a
full waterish sweete taste, and ripe with the foremost.</p>

<p>The King Catherine is greater then the other, and of the same goodnesse, or rather
better.</p>

<p>The Russet Catherine is a very good middle sized peare.</p>

<p>The Windsor peare is an excellent good peare, well knowne to most persons, and
of a reasonable greatnesse: it will beare fruit some times twice in a yeare (and as it is
said) three times in some places.</p>

<p>The Norwich peare is of two sorts, Summer and Winter, both of them good fruit,
each in their season.</p>

<p>The Worster peare is blackish, a farre better peare to bake (when as it will be like a
Warden, and as good) then to eate rawe; yet so it is not to be misliked.</p>

<p>The Muske peare is like vnto a Catherine peare for bignesse, colour, and forme; but
farre more excellent in taste, as the very name importeth.</p>

<p>The Rosewater peare is a goodly faire peare, and of a delicate taste.</p>

<p>The Sugar peare is an early peare, very sweete, but waterish.</p>


<p>The Summer Popperin &amp;
the Winter Popperin, both of them are very good dry firme peares, somewhat spotted, and brownish on the outside.</p>

<p>The greene Popperin is a winter fruit, of equall goodnesse with the former.</p>

<p>The Soueraigne peare, that which I haue seene and tasted, and so termed vnto me,
was a small brownish yellow peare, but of a most dainty taste; but some doe take a kind
of Bon Chretien, called the Elizabeth peare, to be the Soueraigne peare; how truely
let others iudge.</p>

<p>The Kings peare is a very good and well tasted peare.</p>

<p>The peare Royall is a great peare, and of a good rellish.</p>

<p>The Warwicke peare is a reasonable faire and good peare.</p>

<p>The Greenfield peare is a very good peare, of a middle size.</p>

<p>The Lewes peare is a brownish greene peare, ripe about the end of September, a
reasonable well rellished fruit, and very moist.</p>

<p>The Bishop peare is a middle sized peare, of a reasonable good taste, not very waterish;
but this property is oftentimes seene in it, that before the fruit is gathered,
(but more vsually those that fall of themselues, and the rest within a while after they
are gathered) will be rotten at the core, when there will not be a spot or blemish to bee
seene on the outside, or in all the peare, vntill you come neare the core.</p>

<p>The Wilford peare is a good and a faire peare.</p>

<p>The Bell peare a very good greene peare.</p>

<p>The Portingall peare is a great peare, but more goodly in shew then good indeed.</p>

<p>The Gratiola peare is a kinde of Bon Chretien, called the Cowcumber peare, or
Spinola’s peare.</p>

<p>The Rowling peare is a good peare, but hard, and not good before it bee a little
rowled or bruised, to make it eate the more mellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_593">[593]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pimpe peare is as great as the Windsor peare, but rounder, and of a very good
rellish.</p>

<p>The Turnep peare is a hard winter peare, not so good to eate rawe, as it is to bake.</p>

<p>The Arundell peare is most plentifull in Suffolke, and there commended to be a verie
good peare.</p>

<p>The Berry peare is a Summer peare, reasonable faire and great, and of so good and
wholsome a taste, that few or none take harme by eating neuer so many of them.</p>

<p>The Sand peare is a reasonable good peare, but small.</p>

<p>The Morley peare is a very good peare, like in forme and Colour vnto the Windsor,
but somewhat grayer.</p>

<p>The peare pricke is very like vnto the Greenfield peare, being both faire, great,
and good.</p>

<p>The good Rewell is a reasonable great peare, as good to bake as to eate rawe, and
both wayes it is a good fruit.</p>

<p>The Hawkes bill peare is of a middle size, somewhat like vnto the Rowling peare.</p>

<p>The Petworth peare is a winter peare, and is great, somewhat long, faire, and good.</p>

<p>The Slipper peare is a reasonable good peare.</p>

<p>The Robert peare is a very good peare, plentifull in Suffolke and Norfolke.</p>

<p>The pound peare is a reasonable good peare, both to eate rawe, and to bake.</p>

<p>The ten pound peare, or the hundred pound peare, the truest and best, is the best
Bon Chretien of Syon, so called, because the grafts cost the Master so much the
fetching by the messengers expences, when he brought nothing else.</p>

<p>The Gilloflower peare is a winter peare, faire in shew, but hard, and not fit to bee
eaten rawe, but very good to bake.</p>

<p>The peare Couteau is neither good one way nor other.</p>

<p>The Binsce peare is a reasonable good winter peare, of a russetish colour, and a small
fruit: but will abide good a long while.</p>

<p>The Pucell is a greene peare, of an indifferent good taste.</p>

<p>The blacke Sorrell is a reasonable great long peare, of a darke red colour on the outside.</p>

<p>The red Sorrell is of a redder colour, else like the other.</p>

<p>The Surrine is no very good peare.</p>

<p>The Summer Hasting is a little greene peare, of an indifferent good rellish.</p>

<p>Peare Gergonell is an early peare, somewhat long, and of a very pleasant taste.</p>

<p>The white Genneting is a reasonable good peare, yet not equall to the other.</p>

<p>The Sweater is somewhat like the Windsor for colour and bignesse, but nothing
neare of so good a taste.</p>

<p>The bloud red peare is of a darke red colour on the outside, but piercing very little
into the inner pulpe.</p>

<p>The Hony peare is a long greene Summer peare.</p>

<p>The Winter peare is of many sorts, but this is onely so called, to bee distinguished
from all other Winter peares, which haue seuerall names giuen them, and is a very
good peare.</p>

<p>The Warden or Luke Wards peare of two sorts, both white and red, both great
and small.</p>

<p>The Spanish Warden is greater then either of both the former, and better also.</p>

<p>The peare of Ierusalem, or the stript peare, whose barke while it is young, is as
plainly seene to be stript with greene, red, and yellow, as the fruit it selfe is also, and
is of a very good taste: being baked also, it is as red as the best Warden, whereof Master
William Ward of Essex hath assured mee, who is the chiefe keeper of the Kings
Granary at Whitehall.</p>

<p>Hereof likewise there is a wilde kinde no bigger then ones thumbe, and striped in
the like manner, but much more.</p>

<p>The Choke peares, and other Wilde peares, both great and small, as they are not to
furnish our Orchard, but the Woods, Forrests, Fields, and Hedges, so wee leaue them
to their naturall places, and to them that keep them, and make good vse of them.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Peares.</h4>

<p>The most excellent sorts of Peares, serue (as I said before of Apples) to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>make an after-course for their masters table, where the goodnesse of his Orchard
is tryed. They are dryed also, and so are an excellent repaste, if they
be of the best kindes, fit for the purpose.</p>

<p>They are eaten familiarly of all sorts of people, of some for delight, and
of others for nourishment, being baked, stewed, or scalded.</p>

<p>The red Warden and the Spanish Warden are reckoned among the most
excellent of Peares, either to bake or to roast, for the sicke or for the sound:
And indeede, the Quince and the Warden are the two onely fruits are permitted
to the sicke, to eate at any time.</p>

<p>Perry, which is the iuyce of Peares pressed out, is a drinke much esteemed
as well as Cyder, to be both drunke at home, and carried to the Sea, and
found to be of good vse in long voyages.</p>

<p>The Perry made of Choke Peares, notwithstanding the harshnesse, and
euill taste, both of the fruit when it is greene, as also of the iuyce when it is
new made, doth yet after a few moneths become as milde and pleasant as
wine, and will hardly bee knowne by the sight or taste from it: this hath
beene found true by often experience; and therefore wee may admire the
goodnesse of God, that hath giuen such faculty to so wilde fruits, altogether
thought vselesse, to become vsefull, and apply the benefit thereof both
to the comfort of our soules and bodies.</p>

<p>For the Physicall properties, if we doe as Galen teacheth vs, <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in secundo
Alimentorum</i></cite>, referre the qualities of Peares to their seuerall tastes, as before
he had done in Apples, we shall not neede to make a new worke; those
that are harsh and sowre doe coole and binde, sweet do nourish and warme,
and those betweene these, to haue middle vertues, answerable to their
temperatures, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>Much more might be said, both of this and the other kinds of fruits; but
let this suffice for this place and worke, vntill a more exact be accomplished.</p>

  <span class="line sub-title">The Wallnut.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent cap">A<span class="looks_big">l</span>though the Wallnut tree bee often planted in the middle of great Courtyards,
where by reason of his great spreading armes it taketh vp a great deale of
roome, his shadow reaching farre, so that scarce any thing can well grow neare
it; yet because it is likewise planted in fit places or corners of Orchards, and that it
beareth fruit or nuts, often brought to the table, especially while they are freshest,
sweetest, and fitted to be eaten, let not my Orchard want his company, or you the
knowledge of it. Some doe thinke that there are many sorts of them, because some
are much greater then others, and some longer then others, and some haue a more frangible
shell then others; but I am certainly perswaded, that the soyle and climate
where they grow, are the whole and onely cause of the varieties and differences.
Indeed Virginia hath sent vnto vs two sorts of Wallnuts, the one blacke, the other white,
whereof as yet wee haue no further knowledge. And I know that Clusius reporteth,
he tooke vp at a banquet a long Wallnut, differing in forme and tendernesse of shell
from others, which being set, grew and bore farre tenderer leaues then the others and
a little snipt about the edges, which (as I said) might alter with the soyle and climate:
and besides you may obserue, that many of Clusius differences are very nice, and so I
leaue it.</p>

<p>The Wallnut tree groweth very high and great, with a large and thicke body or
trunke, couered with a thicke clouen whitish greene barke, tending to an ash colour;
the armes are great, and spread farre, breaking out into smaller branches, whereon doe
growe long &amp; large leaues, fiue or seuen set together one against another, with an odde
one at the end, somewhat like vnto ashen leaues, but farre larger, and not so many on a
stalke, smooth, and somewhat reddish at the first springing, and tender also, of a reasonable
good sent, but more strong and headie when they growe old: the fruit or nut is
great and round, growing close to the stalkes of the leaues, either by couples or by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
three set together, couered with a double shell, that is to say, with a greene thicke and
soft outer rinde, and an inner hard shell, within which the white kernell is contained,
couered with a thinne yellow rinde or peeling, which is more easily peeled away
while it is greene then afterwards, and is as it were parted into foure quarters, with a
thinne wooddy peece parting it at the head, very sweete and pleasant while it is fresh,
and for a while after the gathering; but the elder they growe, the harder and more
oily: the catkins or blowings are long and yellow, made of many scaly leaues set close
together, which come forth early in the Spring, and when they open and fall away, vpon
their stalkes arise certaine small flowers, which turne into so many nuts.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h4 title="">The Vse of Wallnuts.</h4>

<p>They are often serued to the table with other fruits while they abide
fresh and sweete; and therefore many to keepe them fresh a long time haue
deuised many wayes, as to put them into great pots, and bury them in the
ground, and so take them out as they spend them, which is a very good
way, and will keepe them long.</p>

<p>The small young nuts while they are tender, being preserued or candid,
are vsed among other sorts of candid fruits, that serue at banquets.</p>

<p>The iuyce of the outer greene huskes are held to be a soueraigne remedy
against either poyson, or plague, or pestilentiall feuer.</p>

<p>The distilled water of the huskes drunke with a little vinegar, if the fits
growe hot and tedious, is an approued remedy for the same.</p>

<p>The water distilled from the leaues, is effectuall to be applyed to fluent
or running vlcers, to dry and binde the humours.</p>

<p>Some haue vsed the pouder of the catkins in white wine, for the suffocation
or strangling of the mother.</p>

<p>The oyle of Wallnuts is vsed to varnish Ioyners workes. As also is accounted
farre to excell Linseede oyle, to mixe a white colour withall, that
the colour bee not dimmed. It is of excellent vse for the coldnesse, hardnesse
and contracting of the sinewes and ioynts, to warme, supple, and to
extend them.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">A<span class="looks_big">l</span>though the ordinary Chesnut is not a tree planted in Orchards, but left to
Woods, Parkes, and other such like places; yet wee haue another sort which
wee haue noursed vp from the nuts sent vs from Turky, of a greater and more
pleasant aspect for the faire leaues, and of as good vse for the fruit. It groweth in time
to be a great tree, spreading with great armes and branches, whereon are set at seuerall
distances goodly faire great greene leaues, diuided into six, seuen, or nine parts or
leaues, euery one of them nicked about the edges, very like vnto the leaues of <i>Ricinus</i>,
or <i>Palma Christi</i>, and almost as great: it beareth at the ends of the branches many flowers
set together vpon a long stalke, consisting of foure white leaues a peece, with many
threads in the middle, which afterwards turne into nuts, like vnto the ordinary Chesnuts,
but set in rougher and more prickly huskes: the nuts themselues being rounder
and blacker, with a white spot at the head of each, formed somewhat like an heart, and
of a little sweeter taste.</p>

<p>It serueth to binde and stop any maner of fluxe, be it of bloud or humours,
either of the belly or stomacke; also the much spitting of bloud. They are
roasted and eaten as the ordinary sort, to make them taste the better.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>ere are two sorts of Mulberries sufficiently known to most, the blackish and
the white: but wee haue had brought vs from Virginia another sort, which is
of greater respect then eyther of the other two, not onely in regard of the raritie,
but of the vse, as you shall presently vnderstand.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Morus nigra.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The blacke Mulberrie.</span>
</h4>

<p>The blacke Mulberrie tree groweth oftentimes tall and great, and oftentimes also
crooked, and spreading abroade, rather then high; for it is subiect to abide what forme
you will conforme it vnto: if by suffering it to grow, it will mount vp, and if you will
binde it, or plash the boughes, they will so abide, and be carried ouer arbours, or other
things as you will haue it. The bodie groweth in time to bee very great, couered with
a rugged or thicke barke, the armes or branches being smoother, whereon doe grow
round thicke leaues pointed at the ends, and nicked about the edges, and in some there
are to be seene deep gashes, making it seeme somewhat like the Vine leafe: the flowers
are certaine short dounie catkings, which turne into greene berries at the first, afterwards
red, and when they are full ripe blacke, made of many graines set together, like
vnto the blacke berrie, but longer and greater: before they are ripe, they haue an austere
and harsh taste, but when they are full ripe, they are more sweete and pleasant;
the iuice whereof is so red, that it will staine the hands of them that handle and eate
them.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" title="">
  <span class="line">2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Morus alba.</i></span>
  <span class="line">The white Mulberrie.</span>
</h4>

<p>The white Mulberrie tree groweth not with vs to that greatnesse or bulke of bodie
that the blacke doth, but runneth vp higher, slenderer, more knotty, hard and brittle,
with thinner spreade armes and branches: the leaues are like the former, but not so
thicke set on the branches, nor so hard in handling, a little paler also, hauing somewhat
longer stalkes: the fruit is smaller and closer set together, greene, and somewhat harsh
before they be ripe, but of a wonderfull sweetnesse, almost ready to procure loathing
when they are thorough ripe, and white, with such like seede in them as in the former,
but smaller.</p>

<p>The Virginia Mulberry tree groweth quickely with vs to be a very great tree, spreading
many armes and branches, whereon grow faire great leaues, very like vnto the
leaues of the white Mulberrie tree: the berry or fruit is longer and redder then either
of the other, and of a very pleasant taste.</p>

<p>The greatest and most especiall vse of the planting of white Mulberries,
is for the feeding of Silke wormes, for which purpose all the Easterne
Countries, as Persia, Syria, Armenia, Arabia <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and also the hither
part of Turkie, Spaine also and Italie, and many other hot Countries doe
nourish them, because it is best for that purpose, the wormes feeding thereon,
giuing the finest and best silke; yet some are confident that the leaues
of the blacke will doe as much good as the white: but that respect must be
had to change your seede, because therein lyeth the greatest mysterie. But
there is a Booke or Tractate printed, declaring the whole vse of whatsoeuer
can belong vnto them: I will therefore referre them thereunto, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
would further vnderstand of that matter.</p>

<p>Mulberries are not much desired to be eaten, although they be somewhat
pleasant, both for that they staine their fingers and lips that eate them, and
doe quickly putrefie in the stomacke, if they bee not taken before meate.</p>

<p>They haue yet a Physicall vse, which is by reason of the astringent quality
while they are red, and before they bee ripe, for sore mouthes and
throats, or the like, whereunto also the Syrup, called Diamoron, is effectuall.</p>

<p>The Bay tree riseth vp oftentimes to carry the face of a tree of a meane bignesse in
our Countrey (although much greater in the hoter) and oftentimes shooteth vp with
many suckers from the roote, shewing it selfe more like to a tall shrubbe or hedge-bush,
then a tree, hauing many branches, the young ones whereof are sometimes reddish,
but most vsually of a light or fresh greene colour, when the stemme and elder
boughes are couered with a darke greene barke: the leaues are somewhat broad, and
long pointed as it were at both the ends, hard and sometimes crumpled on the edges,
of a darke greene colour aboue, and of a yellowish greene vnderneath, in smell sweet,
in taste bitter, and abiding euer greene: the flowers are yellow and mossie, which
turne into berries that are a little long as well as round, whose shell or outermost peele
is greene at the first, and black when it is ripe; wherein is contained an hard bitter kernell,
which cleaueth in two parts.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Vse of Bayes.</h5>

<p>The Bay leaues are of as necessary vse as any other in Garden or Orchard;
for they serue both for pleasure and profit, both for ornament and for vse,
both for honest Ciuill vses, and for Physicke, yea both for the sicke and for
the sound, both for the liuing and for the dead: And so much might be said
of this one tree, that if it were all told, would as well weary the Reader, as
the Relater: but to explaine my selfe; It serueth to adorne the house of
God as well as of man: to procure warmth, comfort and strength to the
limmes of men and women, by bathings and annoyntings outward, and by
drinkes <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> inward to the stomacke, and other parts: to season vessels <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>

as with a garland, the heads of the liuing, and to sticke and decke forth
the bodies of the dead: so that from the cradle to the graue we haue still vse
of it, we haue still neede of it.</p>

branches are set round about, with very narrow long whitish greene leaues, which fall
away from the elder, but abide on the younger, being both winter and summer alwaies

scales, or tuberous knobs, which abide for the most part alwaies greene in our

<p>The kernels within the hard shels, while they are fresh or newly taken

Comfits, Pastes, Marchpanes, and diuers other such like: And with them
a cunning Cooke can make diuers Keck shoses for his Masters table.</p>

The yellow Rossen that is vsed as well to make salues as for many other common vses,

fall away, and are vnprofitable, the acornes not growing from those places, but from
others which are like vnto those of our ordinary Oake, but smaller and blacker, and set
in a more rugged huske or cuppe. This and no other kinde of <i>Ilex</i> doe I know to grow
in all our land in any Garden or Orchard: for that kind with long and narrower leaues,
and not prickly, growing so plentifully as Matthiolus saith in Tuscane, I haue not seen:
and it is very probable to bee the same that Plinie remembreth to haue the leafe of an
Oliue; but not as some would haue it, that <i>Smilax</i> <cite>Theophrastus maketh mention of
in his third Booke and sixteenth Chapter of his Historie of Plants</cite>, which the Arcadians
so called, and had the leafe of the <i>Ilex</i>, but not prickly: for Theophrastus saith,

the elder with a more ash coloured, thicke set with leaues without order, some greater
and others smaller, somewhat like both in forme and bignesse vnto the leaues of the
Barberry tree, but somewhat larger, and more snipt about the edges, of a deeper green
colour also, and with small long thornes scattered here &amp; there vpon the branches: the
flowers come forth as well at the ends of the branches, as at diuers places at the ioynts
of the leaues, standing thicke together, of a pale whitish colour, a little dasht ouer with
a shew of blush, consisting of fiue leaues a peece, with some small threads in the middle,
which turne into berries, very like vnto Hawthorne berries, but much redder and
dryer, almost like polished Corall, wherein are contained foure or fiue small yellowish
white three square seede, somewhat shining. It is thought to be the <i>Oxyacantha</i> of Dioscorides;
but seeing Dioscorides doth explaine the forme of the leafe in <cite>his Chapter
of Medlars, which he concealed in the Chapter of <i>Oxyacantha</i></cite>, it cannot be the same:
for <i>Mespilus Anthedon</i> of Theophrastus, or <i>Aronia</i> of Dioscorides, hath the leafe of
<i>Oxyacantha</i>, as Dioscorides saith, or of Smalladge, as Theophrastus, which cannot
agree to this Thorne; but doth most liuely delineate out our white Thorne or Hawthorne,
that now there is no doubt, but that <i>Oxyacantha</i> of Dioscorides is the Hawthorne
tree or bush.</p>

so orderly, as if it were done by art, and brought to compasse that
middle Arbour: And from those boughes the body was bare againe for

small seede: the roote shooteth forth young suckers farre away, and round about,
whereby it is mightily encreased.</p>

  <span class="line">The Virginia Vine, or rather Iuie.</span>
</h4>

<p class="noindent cap">T<span class="looks_big">h</span>is slender, but tall climing Virginia Vine (as it was first called; but Iuie, as it
doth better resemble) riseth out of the ground with diuers stems, none much
bigger then a mans thumbe, many lesse; from whence shoote forth many long
weake branches, not able to stand vpright, vnlesse they be sustained: yet planted neere
vnto a wall or pale, the branches at seuerall distances of the leaues will shoote forth
small short tendrels, not twining themselues about any thing, but ending into foure,
fiue, or six, or more small short and somewhat broad clawes, which will fasten like a
hand with fingers so close thereunto, that it will bring part of the wall, morter, or
board away with it, if it be pulled from it, and thereby stay it selfe, to climbe vp to the
toppe of the highest chimney of a house, being planted thereat: the leaues are crumpled,
or rather folded together at the first comming forth, and very red, which after
growing forth, are very faire, large, and greene, diuided into foure, fiue, six, or seuen
leaues, standing together vpon a small foote-stalke, set without order on the branches,
at the ends whereof, as also at other places sometime, come forth diuers short tufts of
buds for flowers; but we could neuer see them open themselues, to shew what manner
of flower it would be, or what fruit would follow in our country: the roote spreadeth
here and there, and not very deepe.</p>

<div class="std-info"><h5 title="">The Use of this Virginian.</h5>

<p>We know of no other vse, but to furnish a Garden, and to encrease the
number of rarities.</p>

<h2 class="faux">FINIS</h2>

<p>And thus haue I finished this worke, and furnished it with whatsoeuer Art and Nature
concurring, could effect to bring delight to those that liue in our Climate, and take
pleasure in such things; which how well or ill done, I must abide euery ones censure:
the iudicious and courteous I onely respect, let Momus bite his lip, and eate his heart;
and so Farewell.</p>

<h2 class="nopagebreak" title="" id="tn_end">Transcriber’s Note</h2>

<p class="faux">{Headings} in parentheses have been added by the transcriber.</p>

<p><a href="#frontispiece" title="Go to Frontispiece">Frontispiece</a>—The Tetragrammaton (ְיֹהָוה) is printed within the
sun at the top of the image of the Garden of Eden. The text in the
frontispiece had some characters which were difficult to make out, the
transcription given above for the frontispiece is our best attempt.</p>

<p>On page <a href="#Page_299" title="Go to page 299">299</a> in “The Names” section, “usually” is left as printed.
“Saluia” is sometimes printed as “Salvia” and “maior” as “major”.
The word “fœmina” is often printed “fæmina”.</p>

<p>In the indexes the letter “v” is sometimes used where a “u” is used in the body of the book.
Similarly “e” or even “œ” is sometimes used in the index where an “æ” is used in the body of the book.
Some pairs of characters, “ct” “st” and “sh” were originally printed as ligatures.</p>

<p>There is no chapter CX. and there are two chapters CXXXI. in “The Garden of pleasant Flowers”.</p>

<p>In the illustration on page <a href="#Page_505" title="Go to page 505">505</a>, there is no corresponding caption for label 8.</p>

<p>Numbered lists of plants, in Latin and English, were originally printed with the Latin on the left, and English on the right.
These are here shown one under the other.</p>

<p>Changes made to the text are:</p>

<p>Greek-Ligatures in quotations from the Greek have been expanded, and accents and punctuation have been corrected.</p>

<p>An abbreviation, printed as a lowercase g with a comma above and a cedilla after, has been represented by “q.” throughout.
The ligature “ȣ”, has been expanded to “ου” throughout.</p>

<p>Punctuation has been standardized in ordered lists, headings, indexes and the “Faults escaped in some Copies”.
Numbered sections have had the occasional misnumbering corrected,
and the occasional irregular indentation standardized.</p>

<p>In the last two indexes, the indexed words are usually in italics, unitalicized indexed words have been left as printed.</p>

<p>Other changes made in the main part of the book are:</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
