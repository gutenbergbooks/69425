  _Madame_,

Knowing your Maiestie so much delighted with all the faire Flowers
of a Garden, and furnished with them as farre beyond others, as you
are eminent before them; this my Worke of a Garden, long before this
intended to be published, and but now only finished, seemed as it were
destined, to bee first offered into your Highnesse hands, as of right
challenging the proprietie of Patronage from all others. Accept, I
beseech your Maiestie, this speaking Garden, that may informe you in
all the particulars of your store, as well as wants, when you cannot
see any of them fresh vpon the ground: and it shall further encourage
him to accomplish the remainder; who, in praying that your Highnesse
may enioy the heauenly Paradise, after the many yeares fruition of this
earthly, submitteth to be

TO THE COVRTEOVS READER.


_Although the ancient Heathens did appropriate the first inuention
of the knowledge of Herbes, and so consequently of physicke, some
vnto +Chiron+ the Centaure, and others vnto +Apollo+ or +Æsculapius+
his sonne; yet wee that are Christians haue out of a better Schoole
learned, that God, the Creator of Heauen and Earth, at the beginning
when he created +Adam+, inspired him with the knowledge of all naturall
things (which successiuely descended to +Noah+ afterwardes, and to
his Posterity): for, as he was able to giue names to all the liuing
Creatures, according to their seuerall natures; so no doubt but hee
had also the knowledge, both what Herbes and Fruits were fit, eyther
for Meate or Medicine, for Vse or for Delight. And that +Adam+ might
exercise this knowledge, God planted a Garden for him to liue in,
(wherein euen in his innocency he was to labour and spend his time)
which hee stored with the best and choysest Herbes and Fruits the earth
could produce, that he might haue not onely for necessitie whereon
to feede, but for pleasure also; the place or garden called Paradise
importing as much, and more plainly the words set downe in +Genesis+
the second, which are these; +Out of the ground the Lord God made to
grow euerie tree pleasant to the sight and good for meate+; and in the
24. of +Numbers+, the Parable of Balaam, mentioning the Aloe trees
that God planted; and in other places if there were neede to recite
them. But my purpose is onely to shew you, that Paradise was a place
(whether you will call it a Garden, or Orchard, or both, no doubt of
some large extent) wherein +Adam+ was first placed to abide; that God
was the Planter thereof, hauing furnished it with trees and herbes, as
well pleasant to the sight, as good for meate, and that hee being to
dresse and keepe this place, must of necessity know all the things that
grew therein, and to what vses they serued, or else his labour about
them, and knowledge in them, had been in vaine. And although +Adam+
lost the place for his transgression, yet he lost not the naturall
knowledge, nor vse of them: but that, as God made the whole world, and
all the Creatures therein for Man, so hee may vse all things as well
of pleasure as of necessitie, to bee helpes vnto him to serue his God.
Let men therefore, according to their first institution, so vse their
seruice, that they also in them may remember their seruice to God, and
not (like our Grand-mother +Eve+) set their affections so strongly, on
the pleasure in them, as to deserue the losse of them in this Paradise,
yea and of Heauen also. For truly from all sorts of Herbes and Flowers
we may draw matter at all times not only to magnifie the Creator that
hath giuen them such diuersities of forms, sents and colours, that
the most cunning Worke-man cannot imitate, and such vertues and
properties, that although wee know many, yet many more lye hidden and
vnknowne, but many good instructions also to our selues: That as many
herbes and flowers with their fragrant sweete smels doe comfort, and
as it were reuiue the spirits, and perfume a whole house; euen so such
men as liue vertuously, labouring to doe good, and profit the Church
of God and the Common wealth by their paines or penne, doe as it were
send forth a pleasing savour of sweet instructions, not only to that
time wherein they liue, and are fresh, but being drye, withered and
dead, cease not in all after ages to doe as much or more. Many herbes
and flowers that haue small beautie or savour to commend them, haue
much more good vse and vertue: so many men of excellent rare parts and
good qualities doe lye hid unknown and not respected, vntill time and
vse of them doe set forth their properties. Againe, many flowers haue
a glorious shew of beauty and brauery, yet stinking in smell, or else
of no other vse: so many doe make a glorious ostentation, and flourish
in the world, when as if they stinke not horribly before God, and all
good men, yet surely they haue no other vertue then their outside to
commend them, or leaue behind them. Some also rise vp and appear like a
Lilly among Thornes, or as a goodly Flower among many Weedes or Grasse,
eyther by their honourable authoritie, or eminence of learning or
riches, whereby they excell others, and thereby may doe good to many.
The frailty also of Mans life is learned by the soone fading of them
before their flowring, or in their pride, or soone after, being either
cropt by the hand of the spectator, or by a sudden blast withered and
parched, or by the reuolution of time decaying of it owne nature: as
also that the fairest flowers or fruits first ripe, are soonest and
first gathered. The mutabilitie also of states and persons, by this,
that as where many goodly flowers & fruits did grow this years and
age, in another they are quite pulled or digged vp, and eyther weedes
and grasse grow in their place, or some building erected thereon, and
their place is no more known. The Ciuill respects to be learned from
them are many also: for the delight of the varieties both of formes,
colours and properties of Herbes and Flowers, hath euer beene powerfull
ouer dull, unnurtured, rusticke and sauage people, led only by Natures
instinct; how much, more powerfull is it, or should be in the mindes of
generous persons? for it may well bee said, he is not humane, that is
not allured with this obiect. The study, knowledge, and trauel in them,
as they haue been entertained of great Kings, Princes and Potentates,
without disparagement to their Greatnesse, or hinderance to their more
serious and weighty Affaires: so no doubt vnto all that are capable
thereof, it is not onely pleasant, but profitable, by comforting the
minde, spirits and senses with an harmelesse delight, and by enabling
the iudgement to conferre and apply helpe to many dangerous diseases.
It is also an Instructer in the verity of the genuine Plants of the
Ancients, and a Correcter of the many errours whereunto the world by
continuance hath bin diuerted, and almost therein fixed, by eradicating
in time, and by degrees, the pertinacious wilfulnesse of many, who
because they were brought vp in their errours, are most vnwilling to
leaue them without consideration of the good or euill, the right or
wrong, they draw on therewith. And for my selfe I may well say, that
had not mine owne paines and studies by a naturall inclination beene
more powerfull in mee then any others helpe (although some through
an euill disposition and ignorance haue so far traduced me as to say
this was rather another mans worke then mine owne, but I leaue them to
their folly) I had neuer done so much as I here publish; nor been fit
or prepared for a larger, as time may suddenly (by Gods permission)
bring to light, if the maleuolent dispositions of degenerate spirits
doe not hinder the accomplishment. But perswading my selfe there is
no showre that produceth not some fruit, or no word but worketh some
effect, eyther of good to perswade, or of reproofe to euince; I could
not but declare my minde herein, let others iudge or say what they
please. For I haue alwaies held it a thing vnfit, to conceale or bury
that knowledge God hath giuen, and not to impart it, and further others
therewith as much as is conuenient, yet without ostentation, which I
haue euer hated. Now further to informe the courteous Reader, both of
the occasion that led me on to this worke, and the other occurrences
to it. First, hauing perused many Herbals in Latine, I obserued that
most of them haue eyther neglected or not knowne the many diuersities
of the flower Plants, and rare fruits are known to vs at this time,
and (except +Clusius+) haue made mention but of a very few. In English
likewise we haue some extant, as +Turner+ and +Dodonæus+ translated,
who haue said little of Flowers, +Gerard+ who is last, hath no doubt
giuen vs the knowledge of as many as he attained vnto in his time, but
since his daies we haue had many more varieties, then he or they euer
heard of, as may be perceiued by the store I haue here produced. And
none of them haue particularly seuered those that are beautifull flower
plants, fit to store a garden of delight and pleasure, from the wilde
and vnfit: but haue enterlaced many, one among another, whereby many
that haue desired to haue faire flowers, haue not known eyther what to
choose, or what to desire. Diuers Bookes of Flowers also haue been set
forth, some in our owne Countrey, and more in others, all which are as
it were but handfuls snatched from the plentifull Treasury of Nature,
none of them being willing or able to open all sorts, and declare them
fully; but the greatest hinderance of all mens delight was, that none
of them had giuen any description of them, but the bare name only. To
satisfie therefore their desires that are louers of such Delights, I
took vpon me this labour and charge, and haue here selected and set
forth a Garden of all the chiefest for choyce, and fairest for shew,
from among all the seuerall Tribes and Kindreds of Natures beauty, and
haue ranked them as neere as I could, or as the worke would permit,
in affinity one vnto another. Secondly, and for their sakes that are
studious in Authors, I haue set down the names haue bin formerly giuen
vnto them, with some of their errours, not intending to cumber this
worke with all that might bee said of them, because the deciding of
the many controuersies, doubts, and questions that concerne them,
pertaine more fitly to a generall History: yet I haue beene in some
places more copious and ample then at the first I had intended, the
occasion drawing on my desire to informe others with what I thought
was fit to be known, reseruing what else might be said to another time
& worke; wherein (God willing) I will inlarge my selfe, the subiect
matter requiring it at my hands, in what my small ability can effect.
Thirdly, I haue also to embellish this Worke set forth the figures of
all such plants and flowers as are materiall and different one from
another: but not as some others haue done, that is, a number of the
figures of one sort of plant that haue nothing to distinguish them but
the colour, for that I hold to be superfluous and waste. Fourthly,
I haue also set down the Vertues and Properties of them in a briefe
manner, rather desiring to giue you the knowledge of a few certaine
and true, then to relate, as others haue done, a needless and false
multiplicitie, that so there might as well profit as pleasure be taken
from them, and that nothing might be wanting to accomplish it fully.
And so much for this first part, my Garden of pleasant and delightfull
Flowers. My next Garden consisteth of Herbes and Rootes, fit to be
eaten of the rich and poor as nourishment and food, as sawce or
condiment, as sallet or refreshing, for pleasure or profit; where I doe
as well play the Gardiner, to shew you (in briefe, but not at large)
the times and manner of sowing, setting, planting, replanting, and the
like (although all these things, and many more then are true, are set
down very largely in the seuerall bookes that others haue written of
this subiect) as also to shew some of the Kitchen vses (because they
are Kitchen herbes &c.) although I confesse but very sparingly, not
intending a treatise of cookery, but briefly to giue a touch thereof;
and also the Physicall properties, to shew some what that others haue
not set forth; yet not to play the Empericke, and giue you receipts of
medicines for all diseases, but only to shew in some sort the qualities
of Herbes, to quicken the minds of the studious. And lastly an Orchard
of all sorts of domesticke or forraine, rare and good fruits, fit for
this our Land and Countrey, which is at this time better stored and
furnished then euer in any age before. I haue herein endeauoured, as
in the other Gardens, to set forth the varieties of euery sort in as
briefe a manner as possibly could be, without superfluous repetitions
of descriptions, and onely with especiall notes of difference in
leaues, flowers and fruits. Some few properties also are set downe,
rather the chiefest then the most, as the worke did require. And
moreouer before euery of these parts I haue giuen Treatises of the
ordering, preparing and keeping the seuerall Gardens and Orchard, with
whatsoeuer I thought was conuenient to be known for euery of them._

_Thus haue I shewed you both the occasion and scope of this Worke, and
herein haue spent my time, paines and charge, which if well accepted, I
shall thinke well employed, and may the sooner hasten the fourth Part,
A Garden of Simples; which will be quiet no longer at home, then that
it can bring his Master newes of faire weather for the iourney._

THE ORDERING OF THE GARDEN OF PLEASVRE.




CHAP. I.

_The situation of a Garden of pleasure, with the nature of soyles,
and how to amend the defects that are in many sorts of situations and
grounds._


The seuerall situations of mens dwellings, are for the most part
vnauoideable and vnremoueable; for most men cannot appoint forth such
a manner of situation for their dwelling, as is most fit to auoide all
the inconueniences of winde and weather, but must bee content with
such as the place will afford them; yet all men doe well know, that
some situations are more excellent than others: according therfore
to the seuerall situation of mens dwellings, so are the situations
of their gardens also for the most part. And although diuers doe
diuersly preferre their owne seuerall places which they haue chosen,
or wherein they dwell; As some those places that are neare vnto a
riuer or brooke to be best for the pleasantnesse of the water, the
ease of transportation of themselues, their friends and goods, as
also for the fertility of the soyle, which is seldome bad neare vnto
a riuers side; And others extoll the side or top of an hill, bee it
small or great, for the prospects sake; And againe, some the plaine
or champian ground, for the euen leuell thereof: euery one of which,
as they haue their commodities accompanying them, so haue they also
their discommodities belonging vnto them, according to the Latine
Prouerbe, _Omne commodum fert suum incommodum_. Yet to shew you for
euerie of these situations which is the fittest place to plant your
garden in, and how to defend it from the iniuries of the cold windes
and frosts that may annoy it, will, I hope, be well accepted. And
first, for the water side, I suppose the North side of the water to
be the best side for your garden, that it may haue the comfort of the
South Sunne to lye vpon it and face it, and the dwelling house to bee
aboue it, to defend the cold windes and frosts both from your herbes,
and flowers, and early fruits. And so likewise I iudge for the hill
side, that it may lye full open to the South Sunne, and, the house
aboue it, both for the comfort the ground shall receiue of the water
and raine descending into it, and of defence from winter and colds.
Now for the plaine leuell ground, the buildings of the house should
be on the North side of the garden, that so they might bee a defence
of much sufficiency to safeguard it from many iniurious cold nights
and dayes, which else might spoyle the pride thereof in the bud. But
because euery one cannot so appoint his dwelling, as I here appoint
the fittest place for it to be, euery ones pleasure thereof shall be
according to the site, cost, and endeauours they bestow, to cause it
come nearest to this proportion, by such helpes of bricke or stone wals
to defend it, or by the helpe of high growne and well spread trees,
planted on the North side thereof, to keepe it the warmer. And euery
of these three situations, hauing the fairest buildings of the house
facing the garden in this manner before specified, besides the benefit
of shelter it shall haue from them, the buildings and roomes abutting
thereon, shall haue reciprocally the beautifull prospect into it, and
haue both sight and sent of whatsoeuer is excellent, and worthy to giue
content out of it, which is one of the greatest pleasures a garden can
yeeld his Master. Now hauing shewed you the best place where this your
garden should be, let me likewise aduise you where it should not be,
at least that it is the worst place wherein it may be, if it be either
on the West or East side of your house, or that it stand in a moorish
ground, or other vnwholsome ayre (for many, both fruits, herbes, and
flowers that are tender, participate with the ayre, taking in a manner
their chiefest thriuing from thence) or neare any common Lay-stalles,
or common Sewers, or else neare any great Brew-house, Dye-house, or any
other place where there is much smoake, whether it be of straw, wood,
or especially of sea-coales, which of all other is the worst, as our
Citie of London can giue proofe sufficient, wherein neither herbe nor
tree will long prosper, nor hath done euer since the vse of sea-coales
beganne to bee frequent therein. And likewise that it is much the
worse, if it bee neare vnto any Barnes or Stackes of corne or hey,
because that from thence will continually with the winde bee brought
into the garden the strawe and chaffe of the corne, the dust and seede
of the hey to choake or pester it. Next vnto the place or situation,
let mee shew you the grounds or soyles for it, eyther naturall or
artificiall. No man will deny, but the naturall blacke mould is not
only the fattest and richest, but farre exceedeth any other either
naturall or artificiall, as well in goodnesse as durability. And next
thereunto, I hold the sandy loame (which is light and yet firme, but
not loose as sand, nor stiffe like vnto clay) to be little inferiour
for this our Garden of pleasure; for that it doth cause all bulbous
and tuberous rooted plants to thriue sufficiently therein, as likewise
all other flower-plants, Roses, Trees, &c. which if it shall decay by
much turning and working out the heart of it, may soone be helped with
old stable manure of horses, being well turned in, when it is old and
almost conuerted to mould. Other grounds, as chalke, sand, grauell,
or clay, are euery of them one more or lesse fertill or barren than
other; and therefore doe require such helpes as is most fit for them.
And those grounds that are ouer dry, loose, and dustie, the manure
of stall fedde beasts and cattell being buried or trenched into the
earth, and when it is thorough rotten (which will require twice the
time that the stable soyle of horses will) well turned and mixed with
the earth, is the best soyle to temper both the heate and drinesse
of them. So contrariwise the stable dung of horses is the best for
cold grounds, to giue them heate and life. But of all other sorts of
grounds, the stiffe clay is the very worst for this purpose; for that
although you should digge out the whole compasse of your Garden, carry
it away, and bring other good mould in the stead thereof, and fill vp
the place, yet the nature of that clay is so predominant, that in a
small time it will eate out the heart of the good mould, and conuert it
to its owne nature, or very neare vnto it: so that to bring it to any
good, there must bee continuall labour bestowed thereon, by bringing
into it good store of chalke, lime, or sand, or else ashes eyther of
wood or of sea-coales (which is the best for this ground) well mixed
and turned in with it. And as this stiffe clay is the worst, so what
ground soeuer commeth nearest vnto the nature thereof, is neared vnto
it in badnesse, the signes whereof are the ouermuch moysture thereof
in Winter, and the much cleaning and chapping thereof in Summer, when
the heate of the yeare hath consumed the moysture, which tyed and bound
it fast together, as also the stiffe and hard working therein: but if
the nature of the clay bee not too stiffe, but as it were tempered and
mixed with sand or other earths, your old stable soyle of horses will
helpe well the small rifting or chapping thereof, to be plentifully
bestowed therin in a fit season. Some also do commend the casting of
ponds and ditches, to helpe to manure these stiffe chapping grounds.
Other grounds, that are ouermoist by springs, that lye too neare
the vpper face of the earth, besides that the beds thereof had need
to be laid vp higher, and the allies, as trenches and furrowes, to
lye lower, the ground it selfe had neede to haue some good store of
chalke-stones bestowed thereon, some certaine yeares, if it may be,
before it be laid into a Garden, that the Winter frosts may breake the
chalke small, and the Raine dissolue it into mould, that so they may
bee well mixed together; than which, there is not any better manure
to soyle such a moist ground, to helpe to dry vp the moysture, and
to giue heate and life to the coldnesse thereof, which doth alwayes
accompany these moist grounds, and also to cause it abide longer in
heart than any other. For the sandy and grauelly grounds, although I
know the well mollified manure of beasts and cattell to be excellent
good, yet I know also, that some commend a white Marle, and some a clay
to be well spread thereon, and after turned thereinto: and for the
chalkie ground, _è conuerso_, I commend fatte clay to helpe it. You
must vnderstand, that the lesse rich or more barren that your ground
is, there needeth the more care, labour, and cost to bee bestowed
thereon, both to order it rightly, & so to preserue it from time to
time: for no artificiall or forc’t ground can endure good any long
time, but that within a few yeares it must be refreshed more or lesse,
according as it doth require. Yet you shall likewise vnderstand, that
this Garden of pleasure stored with these Out-landish flowers; that is,
bulbous and tuberous rooted plants, and other fine flowers, that I haue
hereafter described, and assigned vnto it, needeth not so much or so
often manuring with soyle, &c. as another Garden planted with the other
sorts of English flowers, or a Garden of ordinary Kitchin herbes doth.
Your ground likewise for this Garden had neede to bee well cleansed
from all annoyances (that may hinder the well doing or prospering of
the flowers therein) as stones, weedes, rootes of trees, bushes, &c.
and all other things cumbersome or hurtfull; and therefore the earth
being not naturally fine enough of it selfe, is vsed to bee fitted to
make it the finer, and that either through a hurdle made of sticks, or
lathes, or through square or round sieues platted with fine and strong
thin stickes, or with wyers in the bottome. Or else the whole earth of
the Garden being course, may be cast in the same manner that men vse
to try or fine sand from grauell, that is, against a wall; whereby the
courser and more stony, falling downe from the fine, is to be taken
away from the foote of the heape, the finer sand and ground remaining
still aboue, and on the heape. Or else in the want of a wall to cast it
against, I haue seene earth fined by it selfe in this manner: Hauing
made the floore or vpper part of a large plat of ground cleane from
stones, &c. let there a reasonable round heape of fine earth be set
in the midst thereof, or in stead thereof a large Garden flowerpot,
or other great pot, the bottome turned vpwards, and then poure your
course earth on the top or head thereof, one shouell full after another
somewhat gently, and thereby all the course stuffe and stones will fall
downe to the bottome round about the heape, which must continually be
carefully taken away, and thus you may make your earth as fine as if
it were cast against a wall, the heape being growne great, seruing in
stead thereof. Those that will not prepare their grounds in some of
these manners aforesaid, shall soone finde to their losse the neglect
thereof: for the trash and stones shall so hinder the encrease of their
roots, that they will be halfe lost in the earth among the stones,
which else might be saued to serue to plant wheresoeuer they please.




CHAP. II.

_The frame or forme of a Garden of delight and pleasure, with the
seuerall varieties thereof._


Although many men must be content with any plat of ground, of what
forme or quantity soeuer it bee, more or lesse, for their Garden,
because a more large or conuenient cannot bee had to their habitation:
Yet I perswade my selfe, that Gentlemen of the better sort and quality,
will prouide such a parcell of ground to bee laid out for their Garden,
and in such conuenient manner, as may be fit and answerable to the
degree they hold. To prescribe one forme for euery man to follow, were
too great presumption and folly: for euery man will please his owne
fancie, according to the extent he designeth out for that purpose,
be it orbicular or round, triangular or three square, quadrangular
or foure square, or more long than broad. I will onely shew you here
the seuerall formes that many men haue taken and delighted in, let
euery man chuse which him liketh best, or may most fitly agree to that
proportion of ground hee hath set out for that purpose. The orbicular
or round forme is held in it owne proper existence, to be the most
absolute forme, containing within it all other formes whatsoeuer;
but few I thinke will chuse such a proportion to be ioyned to their
habitation, being not accepted any where I think, but for the generall
Garden to the Vniuersity at Padoa. The triangular or three square is
such a forme also, as is seldome chosen by any that may make another
choise, and as I thinke is onely had where another forme cannot be had,
necessitie constraining them to be therewith content. The foure square
forme is the most vsually accepted with all, and doth best agree to
any mans dwelling, being (as I said before) behinde the house, all the
backe windowes thereof opening into it. Yet if it bee longer than the
breadth, or broader than the length, the proportion of walkes, squares,
and knots may be soon brought to the square forme, and be so cast, as
the beauty thereof may bee no lesse than the foure square proportion,
or any other better forme, if any be. To forme it therfore with walks,
crosse the middle both waies, and round about it also with hedges,
with squares, knots and trayles, or any other worke within the foure
square parts, is according as euery mans conceit alloweth of it, and
they will be at the charge: For there may be therein walkes eyther open
or close, eyther publike or priuate, a maze or wildernesse, a rocke or
mount, with a fountaine in the midst thereof to conuey water to euery
part of the Garden, eyther in pipes vnder the ground, or brought by
hand, and emptied into large Cisternes or great Turkie Iarres, placed
in conuenient places, to serue as an ease to water the nearest parts
thereunto. Arbours also being both gracefull and necessary, may be
appointed in such conuenient places, as the corners, or else where,
as may be most fit, to serue both for shadow and rest after walking.
And because many are desirous to see the formes of trayles, knots, and
other compartiments, and because the open knots are more proper for
these Out-landish flowers; I haue here caused some to be drawne, to
satisfie their desires, not intending to cumber this worke with ouer
manie, in that it would be almost endlesse, to expresse so many as
might bee conceiued and set downe, for that euery man may inuent others
farre differing from these, or any other can be set forth. Let euery
man therefore, if hee like of these, take what may please his mind, or
out of these or his own conceit, frame any other to his fancy, or cause
others to be done as he liketh best, obseruing this _decorum_, that
according to his ground he do cast out his knots, with conuenient roome
for allies and walkes; for the fairer and larger your allies and walkes
be, the more grace your Garden shall haue, the lesse harme the herbes
and flowers shall receiue, by passing by them that grow next vnto the
allies sides, and the better shall your Weeders cleanse both the beds
and the allies.

CHAP. III.

_The many sorts of herbes and other things, wherewith the beds and
parts of knots are bordered to set out the forme of them, with their
commodities and discommodities._


It is necessary also, that I shew you the seuerall materials, wherewith
these knots and trayles are set forth and bordered; which are of two
sorts: The one are liuing herbes, and the other are dead materials;
as leade, boords, bones, tyles, &c. Of herbes, there are many sorts
wherewith the knots and beds in a Garden are vsed to bee set, to shew
forth the forme of them, and to preserue them the longer in their
forme, as also to be as greene, and sweete herbes, while they grow, to
be cut to perfume the house, keeping them in such order and proportion,
as may be most conuenient for their seuerall natures, and euery mans
pleasure and fancy: Of all which, I intend to giue you the knowledge
here in this place; and first, to begin with that which hath beene
most anciently receiued, which is Thrift. This is an euerliuing greene
herbe, which many take to border their beds, and set their knots and
trayles, and therein much delight, because it will grow thicke and
bushie, and may be kept, being cut with a paire of Garden sheeres, in
some good handsome manner and proportion for a time, and besides, in
the Summer time send forth many short stalkes of pleasant flowers, to
decke vp an house among other sweete herbes: Yet these inconueniences
doe accompany it; it will not onely in a small time ouergrow the knot
or trayle in many places, by growing so thicke and bushie, that it
will put out the forme of a knot in many places: but also much thereof
will dye with the frosts and snowes in Winter, and with the drought
in Summer, whereby many voide places will be seene in the knot, which
doth much deforme it, and must therefore bee yearely refreshed: the
thicknesse also and bushing thereof doth hide and shelter snayles and
other small noysome wormes so plentifully, that Gilloflowers, and other
fine herbes and flowers being planted therein, are much spoyled by
them, and cannot be helped without much industry, and very great and
daily attendance to destroy them. Germander is another herbe, in former
times also much vsed, and yet also in many places; and because it will
grow thicke, and may be kept also in some forme and proportion with
cutting, and that the cuttings are much vsed as a strawing herbe for
houses, being pretty and sweete, is also much affected by diuers: but
this also will often dye and grow out of forme, and besides that, the
stalkes will grow too great, hard and stubby, the rootes doe so farre
shoote vnder ground, that, vpon a little continuance thereof, will
spread into many places within the knot, which if continually they be
not plucked vp, they will spoile the whole knot it selfe; and therefore
once in three or foure yeares at the most, it must be taken vp and new
set, or else it will grow too roynish and cumbersome. Hyssope hath also
been vsed to be set about a knot, and being sweete, will serue for
strewings, as Germander: But this, although the rootes doe not runne
or creep like it, yet the stalkes doe quickly grow great aboue ground,
and dye often after the first yeares setting, whereby the grace of the
knot will be much lost. Marierome, Sauorie, and Thyme, in the like
manner being sweete herbes, are vsed to border vp beds and knots, and
will be kept for a little while, with cutting, into some conformity;
but all and euery of them serve most commonly but for one yeares vse,
and will soone decay and perish: and therefore none of these, no more
than any of the former, doe I commend for a good bordering herbe for
this purpose. Lauander Cotton also being finely slipped and set, is of
many, and those of the highest respect of late daies, accepted, both
for the beauty and forme of the herbe, being of a whitish greene mealy
colour, for his sent smelling somewhat strong, and being euerliuing and
abiding greene all the Winter, will, by cutting, be kept in as euen
proportion as any other herbe may be. This will likewise soone grow
great and stubbed, notwithstanding the cutting, and besides will now
and then perish in some places, especially if you doe not strike or put
off the snow, before the Sunne lying vpon it dissolue it: The rarity
& nouelty of this herbe, being for the most part but in the Gardens
of great persons, doth cause it to be of the greater regard, it must
therfore be renewed wholly euery second or third yeare at the most,
because of the great growing therof. Slips of Iuniper or Yew are also
receiued of some & planted, because they are alwayes green, and that
the Iuniper especially hath not that ill sent that Boxe hath, which I
will presently commend vnto you, yet both Iuniper and Yew will soon
grow too great and stubbed, and force you to take vp your knot sooner,
than if it were planted with Boxe. Which lastly, I chiefly and aboue
all other herbes commend vnto you, and being a small, lowe, or dwarfe
kinde, is called French or Dutch Boxe, and serueth very well to set out
any knot, or border out any beds: for besides that it is euer greene,
it being reasonable thicke set, will easily be cut and formed into any
fashion one will, according to the nature thereof, which is to grow
very slowly, and will not in a long time rise to be of any height,
but shooting forth many small branches from the roote, will grow very
thicke, and yet not require so great tending, nor so much perish as
any of the former, and is onely receiued into the Gardens of those
that are curious. This (as I before said) I commend and hold to bee
the best and surest herbe to abide faire and greene in all the bitter
stormes of the sharpest Winter, and all the great heates and droughts
of Summer, and doth recompence the want of a good sweet sent with his
fresh verdure, euen proportion, and long lasting continuance. Yet
these inconueniences it hath, that besides the vnpleasing sent which
many mislike, and yet is but small, the rootes of this Boxe do so much
spread themselues into the ground of the knot, and doe draw from thence
so much nourishment, that it robbeth all the herbes that grow neare
it of their sap and substance, thereby making all the earth about it
barren, or at least lesse fertile. Wherefore to shew you the remedy of
this inconuenience of spreading, without either taking vp the Boxe of
the border, or the herbes and flowers in the knot, is I thinke a secret
knowne but vnto a few, which is this: You shall take a broad pointed
Iron like vnto a Slise or Chessill, which thrust downe right into the
ground a good depth all along the inside of the border of Boxe somewhat
close thereunto, you may thereby cut away the spreading rootes thereof,
which draw so much moisture from the other herbes on the inside, and
by this meanes both preserue your herbes and flowers in the knot, and
your Boxe also, for that the Boxe will be nourished sufficiently from
the rest of the rootes it shooteth on all the other sides. And thus
much for the liuing herbes, that serue to set or border vp any knot.
Now for the dead materials, they are also, as I said before diuers:
as first, Leade, which some that are curious doe border their knots
withall, causing it to be cut of the breadth of foure fingers, bowing
the lower edge a little outward, that it may lye vnder the vpper crust
of the ground, and that it may stand the faster, and making the vpper
edge either plain, or cut out like vnto the battlements of a Church:
this fashion hath delighted some, who haue accounted it stately (at the
least costly) and fit for their degree, and the rather, because it will
be bowed and bended into any round square, angular, or other proportion
as one listeth, and is not much to be misliked, in that the Leade
doth not easily breake or spoile without much iniury, and keepeth vp
a knot for a very long time in his due proportion: but in my opinion,
the Leade is ouer-hot for Summer, and ouer-cold for Winter. Others doe
take Oaken inch boords, and sawing them foure or fiue inches broad,
do hold vp their knot therewith: but in that these boordes cannot bee
drawne compasse into any small scantling, they must serue rather for
long outright beds, or such knots as haue no rounds, halfe rounds or
compassings in them. And besides, these boordes are not long lasting,
because they stand continually in the weather, especially the ends
where they are fastened together will soonest rot and perish, and so
the whole forme will be spoyled. To preuent that fault, some others
haue chosen the shanke bones of Sheep, which after they haue beene well
cleansed and boyled, to take out the fat from them, are stucke into
the ground the small end downewards, and the knockle head vpwards, and
thus being set side to side, or end to end close together, they set
out the whole knot therewith, which heads of bones although they looke
not white the first yeare, yet after they haue abiden some frosts and
heates will become white, and prettily grace out the ground: but this
inconvenience is incident to them, that the Winter frosts will raise
them out of the ground oftentimes, and if by chance the knockle head
of any doe breake, or be strucke off with any ones foot, &c. going by,
from your store, that lyeth by you of the same sort, set another in
the place, hauing first taken away the broken peece: although these
will last long in forme and order, yet because they are but bones
many mislike them, and indeed I know but few that vse them. Tyles are
also vsed by some, which by reason they may bee brought compasse into
any fashion many are pleased with them, who doe not take the whole
Tyle at length, but halfe Tyles, and other broken pieces set somewhat
deepe, into the ground, that they may stand fast, and these take vp
but little roome, and keepe vp the edge of the beds and knots in a
pretty comely manner, but they are often out of frame, in that many
of them are broken and spoiled, both with mens feete passing by, the
weather and weight of the earth beating them downe and breaking them,
but especially the frosts in Winter doe so cracke off their edges,
both at the toppes and sides that stand close one vnto another, that
they must be continually tended and repaired with fresh and sound ones
put in the place of them that are broken or decayed. And lastly (for
it is the latest inuention) round whitish or blewish pebble stones,
of some reasonable proportion and bignesse, neither too great nor too
little, haue beene vsed by some to be set, or rather in a manner but
laide vpon the ground to fashion out the traile or knot, or all along
by the large grauelly walke sides to set out the walke, and maketh a
pretty handsome shew, and because the stones will not decay with the
iniuries of any time or weather, and will be placed in their places
againe, if any should be thrust out by any accident, as also that their
sight is so conspicuous vpon the ground, especially if they be not hid
with the store of herbes growing in the knot; is accounted both for
durability, beauty of the sight, handsomnesse in the worke, and ease in
the working and charge, to be of all other dead materials the chiefest.
And thus, Gentlemen, I haue shewed you all the varieties that I know
are vsed by any in our Countrey, that are worth the reciting (but as
for the fashion of Iawe-bones, vsed by some in the Low Countries, and
other places beyond the Seas, being too grosse and base, I make no
mention of them) among which euery one may take what pleaseth him best,
or may most fitly be had, or may best agree with the ground or knot.
Moreouer, all these herbes that serue for borderings, doe serue as
well to be set vpon the ground of a leuelled knot; that is, where the
allies and foot-pathes are of the same leuell with the knot, as they
may serue also for the raised knot, that is, where the beds of the knot
are raised higher than the allies; but both Leade, Boordes, Bones, and
Tyles, are only for the raised ground, be it knot or beds. The pebble
stones againe are onely for the leuelled ground, because they are so
shallow, that as I said before, they rather lye vpon the earth than
are thrust any way into it. All this that I haue here set downe, you
must vnderstand is proper for the knots alone of a Garden. But for to
border the whole square or knot about, to serue as a hedge thereunto,
euery one taketh what liketh him best; as either Priuet alone, or
sweete Bryer, and white Thorne enterlaced together, and Roses of one,
or two, or more sorts placed here and there amongst them. Some also
take Lauander, Rosemary, Sage, Southernwood, Lauander Cotton, or some
such other thing. Some againe plant Cornell Trees, and plash them, or
keepe them lowe, to forme them into an hedge. And some againe take a
lowe prickly shrubbe, that abideth alwayes greene, described in the end
of this Booke, called in Latine _Pyracantha_, which in time will make
an euer greene hedge or border, and when it beareth fruit, which are
red berries like vnto Hawthorne berries, make a glorious shew among the
greene leaues in the Winter time, when no other shrubbes haue fruit or
leaues.




CHAP. IV.

_The nature and names of diuers Out-landish flowers, that for their
pride, beauty, and earlinesse, are to be planted in Gardens of pleasure
for delight._


Having thus formed out a Garden, and diuided it into his fit and due
proportion, with all the gracefull knots, arbours, walkes, &c. likewise
what is fit to keepe it in the same comely order, is appointed vnto
it, both for the borders of the squares, and for the knots and beds
themselues; let vs now come and furnish the inward parts, and beds
with those fine flowers that (being strangers vnto vs, and giuing
the beauty and brauery of their colours so early before many of our
home bred flowers, the more to entice vs to their delight) are most
beseeming it; and namely, with Daffodils, Fritillarias, Iacinthes,
Saffron-flowers, Lillies, Flowerdeluces, Tulipas, Anemones, French
Cowslips, or Beares eares, and a number of such other flowers, very
beautifull, delightfull, and pleasant, hereafter described at full,
whereof although many haue little sweete scent to commend them, yet
their earlinesse and exceeding great beautie and varietie doth so
farre counteruaile that defect (and yet I must tell you with all, that
there is among the many sorts of them some, and that not a few, that
doe excell in sweetnesse, being so strong and heady, that they rather
offend by too much than by too little sent, and some againe are of so
milde and moderate temper, that they scarce come short of your most
delicate and daintiest flowers) that they are almost in all places with
all persons, especially with the better sort of the Gentry of the Land,
as greatly desired and accepted as any other the most choisest, and the
rather, for that the most part of these Out-landish flowers, do shew
forth their beauty and colours so early in the yeare, that they seeme
to make a Garden of delight euen in the Winter time, and doe so giue
their flowers one after another, that all their brauery is not fully
spent, vntil that Gilliflowers, the pride of our English Gardens, do
shew themselues: So that whosoeuer would haue of euery sort of these
flowers, may haue for euery moneth seueral colours and varieties, euen
from Christmas vntill Midsommer, or after; and then, after some little
respite, vntill Christmas againe, and that in some plenty, with great
content and without forcing; so that euery man may haue them in euery
place, if they will take any care of them. And because there bee many
Gentlewomen and others, that would gladly haue some fine flowers to
furnish their Gardens, but know not what the names of those things are
that they desire, nor what are the times of their flowring, nor the
skill and knowledge of their right ordering, planting, displanting,
transplanting, and replanting; I haue here for their sakes set downe
the nature, names, times, and manner of ordering in a briefe manner,
referring the more ample declaration of them to the worke following.
And first of their names and natures: Of Daffodils there are almost
an hundred sorts, as they are seuerally described hereafter, euery
one to be distinguished from other, both in their times, formes, and
colours, some being eyther white, or yellow, or mixt, or else being
small or great, single or double, and some hauing but one flower vpon
a stalke, others many, whereof many are so exceeding sweete, that a
very few are sufficient to perfume a whole chamber, and besides, many
of them be so faire and double, eyther one vpon a stalke, or many vpon
a stalke, that one or two stalkes of flowers are in stead of a whole
nose-gay, or bundell of flowers tyed together. This I doe affirme
vpon good knowledge and certaine experience, and not as a great many
others doe, tell of the wonders of another world, which themselues
neuer saw nor euer heard of, except some superficiall relation, which
themselues haue augmented according to their owne fansie and conceit.
Againe, let me here also by the way tell you, that many idle and
ignorant Gardiners and others, who get names by stealth, as they doe
many other things, doe call some of these Daffodils Narcisses, when
as all know that know any Latine, that Narcissus is the Latine name,
and Daffodill the English of one and the same thing; and therefore
alone without any other Epithite cannot properly distinguish seuerall
things. I would willingly therefore that all would grow iudicious, and
call euery thing by his proper English name in speaking English, or
else by such Latine name as euery thing hath that hath not a proper
English name, that thereby they may distinguish the seuerall varieties
of things and not confound them, as also to take away all excuses of
mistaking; as for example: The single English bastard Daffodill (which
groweth wilde in many Woods, Groues, and Orchards in England.) The
double English bastard Daffodill. The French single white Daffodill
many vpon a stalke. The French double yellow Daffodill. The great, or
the little, or the least Spanish yellow bastard Daffodill, or the great
or little Spanish white Daffodill. The Turkie single white Daffodill,
or, The Turkie single or double white Daffodill many vpon a stalke,
&c. Of Fritillaria, or the checkerd Daffodill, there are halfe a score
seuerall sorts, both white and red, both yellow and blacke, which are a
wonderfull grace and ornament to a Garden in regard of the Checker like
spots are in the flowers. Of Iacinthes there are aboue halfe an hundred
sorts, as they are specified hereafter; some like vnto little bells
or starres, others like vnto little bottles or pearles, both white
and blew, sky-coloured and blush, and some starlike of many pretty
various formes, and all to giue delight to them that will be curious
to obserue them. Of Crocus or Saffron flowers, there are also twenty
sorts; some of the Spring time, others flowring onely in the Autume or
Fall, earlier or later than another, some whereof abide but a while,
others indure aboue a moneth in their glorious beauty. The Colchicum or
Medowe Saffron, which some call the sonne before the father, but not
properly, is of many sorts also; some flowring in the Spring of the
yeare, but the most in Autume, whereof some haue faire double flowers
very delightfull to behold, and some partly coloured both single and
double so variable, that it would make any one admire the worke of
the Creatour in the various spots and stripes of these flowers. Then
haue wee of Lillies twenty seuerall sorts and colours, among whom I
must reckon the Crowne Imperiall, that for his stately forme deserueth
some speciall place in this Garden, as also the Martagons, both white
and red, both blush and yellow, that require to be set by themselues
apart, as it were in a small round or square of a knot, without many
other, or tall flowers growing neare them. But to tell you of all the
sorts of Tulipas (which are the pride of delight) they are so many,
and as I may say, almost infinite, doth both passe my ability, and as
I beleeue the skill of any other. They are of two especiall sorts,
some flowring earlier, and others later than their fellowes, and that
naturally in all grounds, wherein there is such a wonderfull variety
and mixture of colours, that it is almost impossible for the wit of
man to descipher them thoroughly, and to giue names that may be true
& seuerall distinctions to euery flower, threescore seuerall sorts of
colours simple and mixed of each kind I can reckon vp that I haue,
and of especiall note, and yet I doubt not, but for euery one of them
there are ten others differing from them, which may be seen at seuerall
times, and in seuerall places: & besides this glory of variety in
colors that these flowers haue, they carry so stately & delightfull
a forme, & do abide so long in their brauery (enduring aboue three
whole moneths from the first vnto the last) that there is no Lady or
Gentlewoman of any worth that is not caught with this delight, or not
delighted with these flowers. The Anemones likewise or Windeflowers
are so full of variety and so dainty, so pleasant and so delightsome
flowers, that the sight of them doth enforce an earnest longing desire
in the minde of any one to be a possessour of some of them at the
least: For without all doubt, this one kinde of flower, so variable
in colours, so differing in forme (being almost as many sorts of them
double as single) so plentifull in bearing flowers, and so durable in
lasting, and also so easie both; to preserue and to encrease, is of it
selfe alone almost sufficient to furnish a garden with their flowers
for almost halfe the yeare, as I shall shew you in a fit and conuenient
place. The Beares eares or French Cowslips must not want their deserued
commendations, seeing that their flowers, being many set together
vpon a stalke, doe seeme euery one of them to bee a Nosegay alone of
it selfe: and besides the many differing colours that are to be seene
in them, as white, yellow, blush, purple, red, tawney, murrey, haire
colour, &c. which encrease much delight in all sorts of the Gentry of
the Land, they are not vnfurnished with a pretty sweete sent, which
doth adde an encrease of pleasure in those that make them an ornament
for their wearing. Flowerdeluces also are of many sorts, but diuided
into two especiall, kindes; the one bearing a leafe like a flagge whose
roots are tuberous, thicke and short (one kinde of them being the Orris
rootes that are sold at the Apothecaries, whereof sweete powders are
made to lye among garments) the other having round rootes like vnto
Onions, and narrow long leaues somewhat like grasse: Of both these
kindes there is much variety, especially in their colours. The greater
Flagge kinde is frequent enough and dispersed in this Land, and well
doth serue to decke vp both a Garden and House with natures beauties:
But the chiefe of all is your Sable flower, so fit for a mourning
habit, that I thinke in the whole compasse of natures store, there is
not a more patheticall, or of greater correspondency, nor yet among
all the flowers I know any one comming neare vnto the colour of it.
The other kinde which hath bulbous or Onion like rootes, diuersifieth
it selfe also into so many fine colours, being of a more neate shape
and succinct forme than the former, that it must not bee wanting to
furnish this Garden. The Hepatica or Noble Liuerwoort is another flower
of account, whereof some are white, others red, or blew, or purple,
somewhat resembling Violets, but that there are white threads in the
middest of their flowers, which adde the more grace vnto them; and one
kinde of them is so double, that it resembleth a double thicke Dasie
or Marigold, but being small and of an excellent blew colour, is like
vnto a Button: but that which commendeth the flower as much as the
beauty, is the earlinesse in flowring, for that it is one of the very
first flowers that open themselues after Christmas, euen in the midst
of Winter. The Cyclamen or Sowebread is a flower of rare receipt,
because it is naturally hard to encrease, and that the flowers are like
vnto red or blush coloured Violets, flowring in the end of Summer or
beginning of Autumne: the leaues likewise hereof haue no small delight
in their pleasant colour, being knotted and circled white vpon greene,
and that which most preferreth it, is the Physicall properties thereof
for women, which I will declare when I shall shew you the seuerall
descriptions of the varieties in his proper place. Many other sorts of
flowers there are fit to furnish this Garden, as Leucoium or Bulbous
Violet, both early and late flowring. Muscari or Muske Grape flower.
Starre flowers of diuers sorts. Phalangium or Spiderwort, the chiefe
of many is that sort whose flowers are like vnto a white Lilly. Winter
Crowfoote or Wolfes bane. The Christmas flower like vnto a single
white Rose. Bell flowers of many kindes. Yellow Larkes spurre, the
prettiest flower of a score in a Garden. Flower-gentle or Floramour.
Flower of the Sunne. The Maruaile of Peru or of the world. Double Marsh
Marigold or double yellow Buttons, much differing and farre exceeding
your double yellow Crowfoote, which some call Batchelours Buttons.
Double French Marigolds that smell well, and is a greater kinde than
the ordinary, and farre surpasseth it. The double red Ranunculus or
Crowfoote (farre excelling the most glorious double Anemone) and is
like vnto our great yellow double Crowfoote. Thus having giuen you
the knowledge of some of the choisest flowers for the beds of this
Garden, let me also shew you what are fittest for your borders and for
your arbours. The Iasmine white and yellow. The double Honysockle.
The Ladies Bower, both white, and red, and purple single and double,
are the fittest of Outlandish plants to set by arbours and banqueting
houses, that are open, both before and aboue to helpe to couer them,
and to giue both sight, smell, and delight. The sorts of Roses are
fittest for Standards in the hedges or borders. The Cherry Bay or
Laurocerasus. The Rose Bay or Oleander. The white and the blew Syringa
or Pipe tree, are all gracefull and delightfull to set at seuerall
distances in the borders of knots; for some of them giue beautifull and
sweete flowers. The Pyracantha or Prickly Corall tree doth remaine with
greene leaues all the yeare, and may be plashed, or laid downe, or tyed
to make a fine hedge to border the whole knot, as is said before. The
Wilde Bay or Laurus Tinus, doth chiefly desire to be sheltered vnder a
wall, where it will best thriue, and giue you his beautifull flowers
in Winter for your delight, in recompence of his fenced dwelling. The
dwarfe Bay or Mesereon, is most commonly either placed in the midst of
a knot, or at the corners thereof, and sometimes all along a walke for
the more grace. And thus to fit euery ones fancy, I haue shewed you the
variety of natures store in some part for you to dispose of them to
your best content.




CHAP. V.

_The nature and names of those that are called vsually English flowers._


Those flowers that haue beene vsually planted in former times in
Gardens of this Kingdome (when as our forefathers knew few or none of
those that are recited before) haue by time and custome attained the
name of English flowers, although the most of them were neuer naturall
of this our Land, but brought in from other Countries at one time or
other, by those that tooke pleasure in them where they first saw them:
and I doubt not, but many other sorts than here are set downe, or
now knowne to vs, haue beene brought, which either haue perished by
their negligence or want of skill that brought them, or else because
they could not abide our cold Winters; those onely remaining with vs
that haue endured of themselues, and by their encreasing haue beene
distributed ouer the whole Land. If I should make any large discourse
of them, being so well knowne to all, I doubt I should make a long
tale to small purpose: I will therefore but briefly recite them, that
you may haue them together in one place, with some little declaration
of the nature and quality of them, and so passe to other matters.
And first of Primroses and Cowslips, whereof there are many prettie
varieties; some better knowne in the West parts of this Kingdome,
others in the North, than in any other, vntill of late being obserued
by some curious louers of varieties, they haue been transplanted
diuersly, and so made more common: for although we haue had formerly
in these parts about London greene Primroses vsually, yet we neuer saw
or heard of greene Cowslips both single and double but of late dayes,
and so likewise for Primroses to be both single and double from one
roote, and diuers vpon one stalke of diuers fashions, I am sure is not
vsuall: all which desire rather to bee planted vnder some hedge, or
fence, or in the shade, than in the Sunne. Single Rose Campions, both
white, red, and blush, and the double red Rose Campion also is knowne
sufficiently, and will abide moderate Sunne as well as the shade. The
flower of Bristow or None-such is likewise another kinde of Campion,
whereof there is both white flowring plants and blush as well as Orange
colour, all of them being single flowers require a moderate Sunne and
not the shadow: But the Orange colour Nonesuch with double flowers,
as it is rare and not common, so for his brauery doth well deserue
a Master of account that will take care to keepe and preserue it.
Batchelours Buttons both white and red, are kindes of wilde Campions
of a very double forme, and will reasonably well like the Sunne but
not the shade. Wall-flowers are common in euery Garden, as well the
ordinary double as the single, and the double kinde desireth no more
shade than the single, but the greater kindes both double and single
must haue the Sunne. Stock-Gilloflowers likewise are almost as common
as Wall-flowers, especially the single kindes in euery womans Garden,
but the double kindes are much more rare, and possessed but of a few,
and those onely that will bee carefull to preserue them in Winter; for
besides that the most of them are more tender, they yeeld no seede as
the single kindes doe to preserue them, although one kinde from the
sowing of the seed yeeld double flowers: They will all require the
comfort of the Sunne, especially the double kindes, and to be defended
from cold, yet so as in the Summer they doe not want water wherein they
much ioy, and which is as it were their life. Queenes Gilloflowers
(which some call Dames Violets, and some Winter Gilloflowers, are a
kinde of Stock-Gilloflower) planted in Gardens to serue to fill vp
the parts thereof for want of better things, hauing in mine opinion
neither sight nor sent much to commend them. Violets are the Springs
chiefe flowers for beauty, smell, and vse, both single and double, the
more shadie and moist they stand the better. Snapdragon are flowers of
much more delight, and in that they are more tender to keep, and will
hardly endure the sharpe Winters, vnlesse they stand well defended,
are scarce seene in many Gardens. Columbines single and double, of
many sorts, fashions, and colours, very variable both speckled and
party coloured, are flowers of that respect, as that no Garden would
willingly bee without them, that could tell how to haue them, yet the
rarer the flowers are, the more trouble to keepe; the ordinary sorts on
the contrary part will not be lost, doe what one will. Larkes heeles,
or spurres, or toes, as in seuerall Countries they are called, exceed
in the varietie of colours, both single and double, any of the former
times; for vntill of late dayes none of the most pleasant colours
were seene or heard of: but now the single kindes are reasonable well
disperst ouer the Land, yet the double kindes of all those pleasant
colours (and some other also as beautifull) which stand like little
double Roses, are enioyed but of a few: all of them rise from seed, and
must be sowne euery yeare, the double as well as the single. Pansyes
or Hartes eases of diuers colours, and although without sent, yet not
without some respect and delight. Double Poppies are flowers of a great
and goodly proportion, adorning a Garden with their variable colours
to the delight of the beholders, wherein there is some speciall care
to be taken, lest they turne single; and that is, if you see them
grow vp too thicke, that you must pull them vp, and not suffer them
to grow within lesse than halfe a yard distance, or more one from
another. Double Daisies are flowers not to be forgotten, although they
be common enough in euery Garden, being both white and red, both blush
and speckled, or party coloured, besides that which is called Iacke
an Apes on horsebacke, they require a moist and shadowie place; for
they are scorched away, if they stand in the Sunne in any dry place.
Double Marigolds also are the most common in all Gardens. And so are
the French Marigolds that haue a strong heady sent, both single and
double, whose glorious shew for colour would cause any to beleeue there
were some rare goodnesse or vertue in them. These all are sometimes
preserued in the Winter, if they bee well defended from the cold. But
what shall I say to the Queene of delight and of flowers, Carnations
and Gilloflowers, whose brauery, variety, and sweete smell ioyned
together, tyeth euery ones affection with great earnestnesse, both to
like and to haue them? Those that were knowne, and enioyed in former
times with much acceptation, are now for the most part lesse accounted
of, except a very few: for now there are so many other varieties of
later inuention, that trebleth the other both in number, beauty, and
worth: The names of them doe differ very variably, in that names are
imposed and altered as euerie ones fancy will haue them, that carryed
or sent them into the seuerall Countries from London, where their
truest name is to be had, in mine opinion. I will here but giue you the
names of some, and referre you to the worke ensuing for your further
knowledge. The red and the gray Hulo. The old Carnation, differing from
them both. The Gran Pere. The Cambersiue. The Sauadge. The Christall.
The Prince. The white Carnation, or Delicate. The ground Carnation. The
French Carnation. The Douer. The Oxford. The Bristow. The Westminster.
The Daintie. The Granado, and many other Gilloflowers too tedious to
recite in this place, because I haue amply declared them in the booke
following. But there is another sort of great delight and varietie,
called the Orange tawny Gilloflower, which for the most part hath risen
from seed, and doth giue seed in a more plentifull manner than any of
the former sorts, and likewise by the sowing of the seed, there hath
been gained so many varieties of that excellent worth and respect, that
it can hardly be expressed or beleeued, and called by diuers names
according to the marking of the flowers; as The Infanta. The Stript
Tawny, The Speckled Tawny. The Flackt Tawny. The Griseld Tawny, and
many others, euery one to bee distinguished from others: Some also haue
their flowers more double and large than others, and some from the same
seed haue single flowers like broad single Pinkes: the further relation
of them, viz. their order to sowe, encrease and preserue them, you
shall haue in the subsequent discourse in a place by it selfe. Pinkes
likewise both single and double are of much variety, all of them very
sweete, comming neare the Gilloflowers. Sweete Williams and Sweete
Iohns, both single and double, both white, red, and spotted, as they
are kindes of wilde Pinkes, so for their grace and beauty helpe to
furnish a Garden, yet desire not to stand so open to the Sunne as the
former. Double and single Peonies are fit flowers to furnish a Garden,
and by reason of their durability, giue out fresh pleasure euery
yeare without any further trouble of sowing. And lastly, Hollihocks
both single and double, of many and sundry colours, yeeld out their
flowers like Roses on their tall branches, like Trees, to sute you with
flowers, when almost you haue no other to grace out your Garden: the
single and double doe both yeeld seed, and yet doe after their seeding
abide many yeares. Thus haue I shewed you most of the English, as well
as (I did before) the Outlandish flowers that are fit to furnish the
knots, trailes, beds, and borders of this Garden. Roses onely, as I
said before, I reserve to circle or encompasse all the rest, because
that for the most part they are planted in the outer borders or the
quarters, and sometimes by themselues in the middle of long beds, the
sorts or kindes whereof are many, as they are declared in their proper
place: but the White Rose, the Red, and the Damaske, are the most
ancient Standards in England, and therefore accounted naturall.




CHAP. VI.

_The order and manner to plant and replant all the sorts of Out-landish
flowers spoken of before, as well those with bulbous rootes, as others
with stringie rootes._


Whereas it is the vsuall custome of most in this Land, to turne vp
their Gardens, and to plant them againe in the Spring of the yeare,
which is the best time that may bee chosen for all English flowers,
yet it is not so for your Out-landish flowers. And herein indeede hath
beene not onely the errour of a great many to hinder their rootes from
bearing out their flowers as they should, but also to hinder many to
take delight in them, because as they say they will not thriue and
prosper with them, when as the whole fault is in the want of knowledge
of the fit and conuenient time wherein they should bee planted. And
because our English Gardiners are all or the most of them vtterly
ignorant in the ordering of these Out-landish flowers, as not being
trained vp to know them, I haue here taken vpon mee the forme of a new
Gardiner, to giue instructions to those that will take pleasure in
them, that they may be the better enabled with these helpes I shall
shew them, both to know how they should be ordered, and to direct
their Gardiners that are ignorant thereof, rightly to dispose them
according to their naturall qualities. And I doe wish all Gentlemen
and Gentlewomen, whom it may concerne for their owne good, to bee as
carefull whom they trust with the planting and replanting of these
fine flowers, as they would be with so many Iewels; for the rootes of
many of them being small, and of great value, may be soone conueyed
away, and a cleanly tale faire told, that such a roote is rotten, or
perished in the ground if none be seen where it should be, or else that
the flower hath changed his colour, when it hath been taken away, or
a counterfeit one hath beene put in the place thereof; and thus many
haue been deceiued of their daintiest flowers, without remedy or true
knowledge of the defect. You shall therefore, if you will take the
right course that is proper for these kindes of flowers, not set or
plant them among your English flowers; for that when the one may be
remoued, the other may not be stirred: but plant those rootes that are
bulbous, or round like Onions, eyther in knots or beds by themselues
which is the best, or with but very few English or Out-landish flower
plants that haue stringie rootes: For you must take this for a generall
rule, that all those rootes that are like Lillies or Onions, are to
bee planted in the moneths of Iuly or August, or vnto the middle or
end of September at the furthest, if you will haue them to prosper as
they should; and not in the Spring of the yeare, when other gardening
is vsed. Yet I must likewise giue you to vnderstand, that if Tulipas,
and Daffodils, and some other that are firme and hard rootes, and
not limber or spongie, being taken vp out of the ground in their fit
season, that is, in Iune, Iuly, and August, and likewise kept well
and dry, may be reserued out of the ground vntill Christmas or after,
and then (if they could not be set sooner) being set, will thriue
reasonable well, but not altogether so well as the former, being set
long before; but if you shall remoue these bulbous rootes againe,
either presently after their planting; hauing shot their small fibres
vnder the round rootes, and sprung likewise vpwards, or before they
be in flower at the soonest (yet Tulipas, Daffodils, and many other
bulbous, may be safely remoued being in flower, and transplanted into
other places, so as they be not kept too long out of the ground) you
shall much endanger them either vtterly to perish, or to be hindered
from bearing out their flowers they then would haue borne, and for
two or three years after from bearing flowers againe. For the order
of their planting there are diuers wayes, some whereof I will shew
you in this place: Your knot or beds being prepared fitly, as before
is declared, you may place and order your rootes therein thus, Eyther
many rootes of one kind set together in a round or cluster, or longwise
crosse a bed one by another, whereby the beauty of many flowers of one
kinde being together, may make a faire shew well pleasing to many; Or
else you may plant one or two in a place dispersedly ouer the whole
knot, or in a proportion or diameter one place answering another of
the knot, as your store will suffer you, or your knot permit: Or you
may also mingle these rootes in their planting many of diuers sorts
together, that they may giue the more glorious shew when they are in
flower; and that you may so doe, you must first obserue the seuerall
kindes of them, which doe flower at one and the same time, and then
to place them in such order and so neare one vnto another, that their
flowers appearing together of seuerall colours, will cause the more
admiration in the beholders: as thus, The Vernall Crocus or Saffron
flowers of the Spring, white, purple, yellow, and stript, with some
Vernall Colchicum or Medow Saffron among them, some Dens Caninus or
Dogges teeth, and some of the small early Leucoium or Bulbous Violet,
all planted in some proportion as neare one vnto another as is fit for
them, will giue such a grace to the Garden, that the place will seeme
like a peece of tapestry of many glorious colours, to encrease euery
ones delight: Or else many of one sort together, as the blew, white,
and blush Grape flowers in the same manner intermingled, doe make a
maruellous delectable shew, especially because all of them rise almost
to an equall height, which causeth the greater grace, as well neare
hand as farre of. The like order may be kept with many other things,
as the Hepatica, white, blew, purple, and red set or sowne together,
will make many to beleeue that one roote doth beare all those colours:
But aboue and beyond all others, the Tulipas may be so matched, one
colour answering and setting of another, that the place where they
stand may resemble a peece of curious needle-worke, or peece of
painting; and I haue knowne in a Garden, the Master as much commended
for this artificiall forme in placing the colours of Tulipas, as for
the goodnesse of his flowers, or any other thing. The diuers sorts and
colours of Anemones or Winde-flowers may be so ordered likewise, which
are very beautifull, to haue the seuerall varieties planted one neare
vnto another, that their seuerall colours appearing in one place will
be a very great grace in a Garden, or if they be dispersed among the
other sorts of flowers, they will make a glorious shew. Another order
in planting you may obserue; which is this, That those plants that
grow low, as the Aconitum Hyemale or Winter-wolues bane, the Vernall
Crocus or Saffron-flowers of diuers sorts, the little early Leucoium
or Bulbous Violet, and some such other as rise not vp high, as also
some Anemones may be very well placed somewhat neare or about your
Martagons, Lillies, or Crownes Imperiall, both because these little
plants will flower earlier than they, and so will bee gone and past,
before the other greater plants will rise vp to any height to hinder
them; which is a way may well be admitted in those Gardens that are
small, to saue roome, and to place things to the most aduantage. Thus
hauing shewed you diuers wayes and orders how to plant your rootes,
that your flowers may giue the greater grace in the Garden, let mee
shew you likewise how to set these kindes of rootes into the ground;
for many know not well eyther which end to set vpwards or downewards,
nor yet to what depth they should be placed in the ground. Daffodils if
they be great rootes, will require (as must bee obserued in all other
great plants) to bee planted somewhat deeper than the smaller of the
same kinde as also that the tops or heads of the rootes be about two
or three fingers breadth hid vnder ground. The Tulipas likewise if you
set them deepe, they will be the safer from frosts if your ground be
cold, which will also cause them to be a little later before they be
in flower, yet vsually if the mould be good, they are to be set a good
hand breadth deep within the ground, so that there may be three or
foure inches of earth at the least aboue the head, which is the smaller
end of the roote: for if they shall lye too neare the vpper face or
crust of the earth, the colds & frosts will pierce and pinch them
the sooner. After the same order and manner must Hyacinthes, whether
great or small, and other such great rootes be planted. Your greater
rootes, as Martagons, Lillies, and Crownes Imperiall, must be set much
deeper than any other bulbous roote, because they are greater rootes
than others, and by themselues also, as is most vsuall either in some
square, round, triangle, or other small part in the Garden, because
they spread and take vp a very great deale of ground. All of them
likewise are to be set with the broad end of the roote downewards, and
the small end vpwards, that is, both Lillies, Daffodils, Hyacinthes,
and Tulipas, and all other sorts of round rootes, which shew one end
to bee smaller than another. But the Colchicum or Medow-Saffron onely
requireth an exception to this generall rule, in regard the roote
thereof hath a small eminence or part on the one side thereof, which
must bee set or planted downeward, and not vpward; for you shall
obserue, if the roote lye a little moist out of the ground, that it
will shoote fibres out at the small long end thereof, although you may
perceiue when you take it vp, that the fibres were at the other broad
end or side of the roote. As for the Crowne Imperiall, which is a broad
round roote and flat withall, hauing a hole in the middle, for the
most part quite thorow, when it is taken vp in his due time out of the
ground, you shall perceiue the scales or cloues of the rootes to bee
a little open on the vpperside, and close and flat on the vnderside,
which will direct you which part to set vpward; as also that the hole
is bigger aboue then it is below. The Persian Lilly is almost like
unto the Crowne Imperiall, but that the roote thereof is not so flat,
and that it hath a smaller head at the one part, whereby it may be
discerned the plainer how to be set. The Fritillaria is a small white
root diuided as it were into two parts, so that many haue doubted, as
formerly in the Crowne Imperiall, what part to set vppermost; you shall
therefore marke, that the two parts of the roote are ioyned together
at the bottome, where it shooteth out fibres or small stringie rootes,
as all other sorts of bulbous rootes doe, and withall you shall see,
that betweene the two parts of the roote a small head will appeare,
which is the burgeon that will spring vp to beare leaues and flowers.
In the rootes of Anemones there are small round swelling heads, easie
enough to be obserued if you marke it, which must be set vpwards. All
other sorts of stringie rooted plants (and not bulbous or tuberous
rooted) that lose their greene leaues in Winter, will shew a head from
whence the leaues and flowers will spring, and all others that keepe
their greene leaues, are to bee planted in the same manner that other
herbes and flower-plants are accustomed to be. But yet for the better
thriuing of the stringie rooted plants, when you will plant them, let
me informe you of the best way of planting, and the most sure to cause
any plant to comprehend in the ground without failing, and is no common
way with any Gardiner in this Kingdome, that euer I heard or knew,
which is thus: Presuming that the stringie rooted plant is fresh and
not old gathered, and a plant that being remoued will grow againe, make
a hole in the ground large enough where you meane to set this roote,
and raise the earth within the hole a little higher in the middle then
on the sides, and set the roote thereon, spreading the strings all
abroad about the middle, that they may as it were couer the middle, and
then put the earth gently round about it, pressing it a little close,
and afterwards water it well, if it be in Summer, or in a dry time, or
otherwise moderately: thus shall euery seuerall string of the roote
haue earth enough to cause it to shoote forth, and thereby to encrease
farre better than by the vsuall way, which is without any great care
and respect to thrust the rootes together into the ground. Diuers other
flower plants are but annuall, to bee new sowne euery yeare; as the
Maruaile of the world, the Indian Cresses, or yellow Larkes heeles,
the Flower of the Sunne, and diuers others: they therefore that will
take pleasure in them, that they may enioy their flowers the earlier
in the yeare, and thereby haue ripe seede of them while warme weather
lasteth, must nurse vp their seedes in a bed of hot dung, as Melons and
Cowcumbers are, but your bed must be prouided earlier for these seeds,
than for Melons, &c. that they may haue the more comfort of the Summer,
which are to be carefully tended after they are transplanted from the
hotbed, and couered with straw from colds, whereby you shall not faile
to gaine ripe seed euery yeare, which otherwise if you should misse
of a very kindly & hot Summer, you should neuer haue. Some of these
seedes neede likewise to be transplanted from the bed of dung vnder a
warme wall, as the Flower of the Sunne, and the Maruaile of the world,
and some others, and that for a while after their transplanting, as
also in the heate of Summer, you water them at the roote with water
that hath stood a day or two in the Sunne, hauing first laid a round
wispe of hay or such other thing round about the roote, that so all
helpes may further their giuing of ripe seede. One or two rules more
I will giue you concerning these dainty flowers, the first whereof
is this, That you shall not bee carefull to water any of your bulbous
or tuberous rooted plants at any time; for they all of them do better
prosper in a dry ground than in a wet, onely all sorts of tuberous
rooted Flowerdeluces vpon their remouall had neede of a little water,
and some will doe so also to such Tulipas and other bulbous rootes as
they transplant, when they are in flower, and this is I grant in some
sort tolerable, if it bee not too much, and done onely to cause the
stalke and flower to abide sometime the longer before they wither, but
else in no other case to be permitted. The second rule is, That I would
aduise you to water none of your dainty flowers or herbes, with any
water that hath presently before been drawne out of a well or pumpe,
but onely with such water that hath stood open in the Sunne in some
cisterne, tubbe, or pot for a day at the least, if more the better: for
that water which is presently drawne out of a well, &c. is so cold,
that it presently chilleth & killeth any dainty plant be it younger or
elder grown, whereof I haue had sufficient proofe: and therfore I giue
you this caution by mine own experience. Thus haue I directed you from
point to point, in all the particulars of preparing & planting that
belong to this Garden, sauing only that yet I would further enforme
you of the time of the flowring of these Out-landish plants, according
to the seuerall moneths in the yeare, that euery one may know what
flowers euery moneth yeeldeth, and may chuse what them liketh best,
in that they may see that there is no moneth, but glorieth in some
peculiar sorts of rare flowers. I would likewise rather in this place
shew you, the true and best manner & order to encrease and preserue
all sorts of Gilloflowers & Carnations, then ioyne it with the Chapter
of Gilloflowers in the worke following, because it would in that place
take vp too much roome. And lastly, I must of necessity oppose three
sundry errours, that haue possessed the mindes of many both in former
and later times, which are, that any flower may be made to grow double
by art, that was but single before by nature: And that one may by art
cause any flower to grow of what colour they will: And that any plants
may be forced to flower out of their due seasons, either earlier or
later, by an art which some can vse. All which being declared, I then
suppose enough is spoken for an introduction to this worke, referring
many other things to the seuerall directions in the Chapters of the
booke.




CHAP. VII.

_The seuerall times of the flowring of these Out-landish flowers,
according to the seuerall moneths of the yeare._


I intend in this place onely to giue you briefly, the names of some of
the chiefest of these Out-landish flowers, according to the seuerall
moneths of the yeare wherein they flower, that euery one seeing what
sorts of flowers euery moneth yeeldeth, may take of them which they
like best. I begin with Ianuary, as the first moneth of the yeare,
wherein if the frosts be not extreme, you shall haue these flowers of
plants; the Christmas flower or Helleborus niger verus, Winter wolues
bane or Aconitum hyemale, Hepatica or Noble Liuer wort blew and red,
and of shrubbes, the Laurus Tinus or Wilde Bay tree, and Mesereon or
the dwarfe Bay: but because Ianuarie is oftentimes too deepe in frosts
and snow, I therefore referre the Hepaticas vnto the moneth following,
which is February, wherein the weather beginneth to be a little
milder, and then they will flower much better, as also diuers sorts of
Crocus or Saffron flower will appeare, the little early Summer foole
or Leucoium bulbosum, and towards the latter end thereof the Vernall
Colchicum, the Dogges tooth Violet or Dens Caninus, and some Anemones,
both single and double, which in some places will flower all the Winter
long. March will yeeld more varieties; for besides that it holdeth some
of the flowers of the former moneth, it will yeeld you both the double
blew Hepatica, and the white and the blush single: then also you shall
haue diuers other sorts of Crocus or Saffron flowers, Double yellow
Daffodils, Orientall Iacinths and others, the Crowne Imperiall, diuers
sorts of early Tulipas, some sorts of French Cowslips, both tawney,
murry, yellow and blush, the early Fritillaria or checkered Daffodill,
and some other sorts of early Daffodils, and many sorts of Anemones.
In Aprill commeth on the pride of these strangers; for herein you may
behold all the sorts of Auricula Vrsi or Beares Eares, many sorts
of Anemones, both single and double, both the sorts of Tulipas, the
earlier vntill the middle of the moneth, and the later then beginning;
which are of so many different colours, that it is almost impossible
to expresse them, the white, red, blacke, and yellow Fritillarias, the
Muscari or Muske Grape flower, both ash colour and yellow. Diuers other
sorts of Iacinths and Daffodils, both single and double, the smaller
sorts of Flowerdeluces, the Veluet Flowerdeluce and double Honysuckles,
with diuers others. May likewise at the beginning seemeth as glorious
as Aprill, although toward the end it doth decline, in regard the heate
of the Sunne hath by this time drawne forth all the store of natures
tenderest dainties, which are vsually spent by the end of this moneth,
and then those of stronger constitution come forward. Herein are to
bee seene at the beginning the middle flowring Tulipas, and at the
end the later sorts: some kindes of Daffodils, the Day Lillies, the
great white Starre flower, the Flowerdeluce of Constantinople or the
mourning Sable flower, the other sorts of Flowerdeluces. Single and
double white Crowfoote, and single and double red Crowfoot, the glory
of a Garden: the early red Martagon, the Persian Lilly, the yellow
Martagon, the Gladiolus or Corne flagge, both white, red, and blush:
the double yellow Rose, and some other sorts of Roses. In Iune doe
flower the white and the blush Martagon, the Martagon Imperiall, the
mountaine Lillies, and the other sorts of white and red Lillies, the
bulbous Flowerdeluces of diuers sorts, the red flowred Ladies bower,
the single and double purple flowred Ladies bower, the white Syringa
or Pipe tree, for the blew Pipe tree flowreth earlier, the white and
the yellow Iasmin. Iuly holdeth in flower some of the Ladies bowers
and Iasmines, and besides doth glory in the Female Balsame apple, the
Indian Cresses or yellow Larkes spurres, the purple Flower-gentle and
the Rose Bay. In August begin some of the Autumne bulbous flowers to
appeare, as the white and the purple Colchicum or Medow Saffron, the
purple mountaine Crocus or Saffron flower, the little Autumne Leucoium
and Autumne Iacinth, the Italian Starrewort, called of some the purple
Marigold, the Meruaile of Peru or of the world, the Flower of the
Sunne, the great blew Bell-flower, the great double French Marigold.
September flourisheth with the Flower of the Sunne, the Meruaile of
the world, the purple Marigold, and blew Bell-flower spoken of before,
and likewise the other sorts of Medow Saffron, and the double kinde
likewise, the siluer Crocus, the Autumne yellow Daffodill, Cyclamen
also or Sowbread shew their flowers in the end of this moneth. October
also will shew the flowers of Cyclamen, and some of the Medow Saffrons.
In Nouember, as also sometimes in the moneth before, the party coloured
Medow Saffron may bee seene, that will longest hold his flower, because
it is the latest that sheweth it selfe, and the ash coloured mountaine
Crocus. And euen December it selfe will not want the true blacke
Hellebor or Christmas flower, and the glorious shew of the Laurus Tinus
or wilde Bay tree. Thus haue I shewed you some of the flowers for euery
moneth, but I referre you to the more ample declarion of them and all
the others, vnto the work following.




CHAP. VIII.

_The true manner and order to encrease and preserue all sorts of
Gilloflowers, as well by slippes as seedes._


Because that Carnations and Gilloflowers bee the chiefest flowers of
account in all our English Gardens, I haue thought good to entreate
somewhat amply of them, and that a part by it selfe, as I said a little
before, in regard there is so much to be said concerning them, and
that if all the matters to be entreated of should haue beene inserted
in the Chapter of Gilloflowers, it would haue made it too tedious and
large, and taken vp too much roome. The particular matters whereof I
mean in this place to entreate are these: How to encrease Gilloflowers
by planting and by sowing, and how to preserue them being encreased,
both in Summer from noysome and hurtfull vermine that destroy them,
and in Winter from frosts, snowes, and windes, that spoile them. There
are two wayes of planting, whereby to encrease these faire flowers;
the one is by slipping which is the old and ready vsuall way, best
knowne in this Kingdome; the other is more sure, perfect, ready, and of
later inuention, _videlicet_, by laying downe the branches. The way to
encrease Gilloflowers by slipping, is so common with all that euer kept
any of them, that I think most persons may thinke me idle, to spend
time to set downe in writing that which is so well known vnto all:
Yet giue me leaue to tell them that so might imagine, that (when they
haue heard or read what I haue written thereof, if they did know fully
as much before) what I here write, was not to informe them, but such
as did not know the best, or so good a way as I teach them: For I am
assured, the greatest number doe vse, and follow the most vsuall way,
and that is not alwaies the best, especially when by good experience
a better way is found, and may be learned; and therefore if some can
doe a thing better than others, I thinke it is no shame to learne it
of them. You shall not then (to take the surest course) take any long
spindled branches, nor those branches that haue any young shootes from
the ioynts on them, nor yet sliue or teare any slippe or branch from
the roote; for all these waies are vsuall and common with most, which
causeth so many good rootes to rot and perish, and also so many slippes
to be lost, when as for the most part, not the one halfe, or with some,
not a third part doth grow and thriue of those slippes they set. And
although many that haue store of plants, doe not so much care what
hauocke they make to gaine some, yet to saue both labour and plants,
I doe wish them to obserue these orders: Take from those rootes from
whence you intend to make your encrease, those shootes onely that are
reasonable strong, but yet young, and not either too small and slender,
or hauing any shootes from the ioynts vpon them; cut these slippes or
shootes off from the stemme or roote with a knife, as conueniently as
the shoote or branch will permit, that is, either close vnto the maine
branch, if it be short, or leauing a ioynt or two behinde you, if it
be long enough, at which it may shoote anew: When you haue cut off
your slippes, you may either set them by and by, or else as the best
Gardiners vse to doe, cast them into a tubbe or pot with water for a
day or two, and then hauing prepared a place conuenient to set them
in, which had neede to bee of the finest, richest, and best mould you
can prouide, that they may thriue therein the better, cut off your
slippe close at the ioynt, and hauing cut away the lowest leaues close
to the stalke, and the vppermost euen at the top, with a little sticke
make a little hole in the earth, and put your slippe therein so deep,
as that the vpper leaues may be wholly aboue the ground, (some vse to
cleaue the stalke in the middle, and put a little earth or clay within
the cleft, but many good and skilfull Gardiners doe not vse it); put
the earth a little close to the slippe with your finger and thumbe,
and there let it rest, and in this manner doe with as many slippes as
you haue, setting them somewhat close together, and not too farre in
sunder, both to saue ground and cost thereon, in that a small compasse
will serue for the first planting, and also the better to giue them
shadow: For you must remember in any case, that these slippes new set,
haue no sight of the Sunne, vntill they be well taken in the ground,
and shot aboue ground, and also that they want not water, both vpon
the new planting and after. When these slippes are well grown vp,
they must be transplanted into such other places as you thinke meete;
that is, either into the ground in beds, or otherwise, or into pots,
which that you may the more safely doe, after you haue well watered
the ground, for halfe a day before you intend to transplant them, you
shall separate them seuerally, by putting down a broad pointed knife
on each side of the slippe, so cutting it out, take euery one by it
selfe, with the earth cleauing close vnto the root, which by reason of
the moisture it had formerly, and that which you gaue presently before,
will be sufficient with any care had, to cause it to hold fast vnto
the roote for the transplanting of it: for if the earth were dry, and
that it should fall away from the roote in the transplanting, it would
hazzard and endanger the roote very much, if it did thriue at all. You
must remember also, that vpon the remouing of these slips, you shadow
them from the heate of the Sunne for a while with some straw or other
thing, vntill they haue taken hold in their new place. Thus although
it bee a little more labour and care than the ordinary way is, yet it
is surer, and will giue you plants that will be so strongly growne
before Winter, that with the care hereafter specified, you shall haue
them beare flowers the next yeare after, and yeeld you encrease of
slippes also. To giue you any set time, wherein these slippes will
take roote, and begin to shoote aboue ground, is very hard to doe; for
that euery slip, or yet euery kinde of Gilloflower is not alike apt
to grow; nor is euery earth in like manner fit to produce and bring
forward the slippes that are set therein: but if both the slippe be apt
to grow, and the earth of the best, fit to produce, I thinke within a
fortnight or three weekes, you shall see them begin to put forth young
leaues in the middle, or else it may be a moneth and more before you
shall see any springing. The best time likewise when to plant, is a
speciall thing to be knowne, and of as great consequence as any thing
else: For if you slippe and set in September, as many vse to doe, or
yet in August, as some may thinke will doe well, yet (vnlesse they be
the most ordinary sorts, which are likely to grow at any time, and
in any place) the most of them, if not all, will either assuredly
perish or neuer prosper well: for the more excellent and dainty the
Gilloflower is, the more tender for the most part, and hard to nurse
vp will the slippes be. The best time therefore is, that you cut off
such slippes as are likely, and such as your rootes may spare, from the
beginning of May vntill the middle of Iune at the furthest, and order
them as I haue shewed you before, that so you may haue faire plants,
plenty of flowers, and encrease sufficient for new supply, without
offence or losse of your store. For the enriching likewise of your
earth, wherein you shall plant your slippes, that they may the better
thriue and prosper, diuers haue vsed diuers sorts of manure; as stable
soyle of horse, beasts or kine, of sheepe, and pigeons, all which are
very good when they are thoroughly turned to mould, to mixe with your
other earth, or being steeped in water, may serue to water the earth
at times, and turned in with it. And some haue likewise proued Tanners
earth, that is, their barke, which after they haue vsed, doth lye on
heapes and rot in their yards, or the like mould from wood-stackes or
yards; but especially, and beyond all other is commended the Willow
earth, that is, that mould which is found in the hollow of old Willow
trees, to be the most principall to mixe with other good earth for
this purpose. And as I haue now giuen you directions for the first
way to encrease them by slipping, so before I come to the other way,
let mee giue you a caueat or two for the preseruing of them, when
they are beginning to runne vtterly to decay and perish: The one
is, that whereas many are, ouer greedy to haue their plants to giue
them flowers, and therefore let them runne all to flower, so farre
spending themselues thereby, that after they haue done flowring, they
grow so weake, hauing out spent themselues, that they cannot possibly
be preserued from the iniuries of the succeeding Winter; you shall
therefore keepe the kinde of any sort you are delighted withall, if you
carefully looke that too many branches doe not runne vp and spindle for
flowers, but rather either cut some of them downe, before they are run
vp too high, within two or three ioynts of the rootes; or else pluck
away the innermost leaues where it springeth forwards, which you see
in the middle of euery branch, before it be runne vp too high, which
will cause them to breake out the faster into slips and suckers at
the ioynts, to hinder their forward luxurie, and to preserue them the
longer: The other is, If you shall perceiue any of your Gilloflower
leaues to change their naturall fresh verdure, and turne yellowish,
or begin to wither in anie part or branch thereof, it is a sure signe
that the roote is infected with some cancker or rottennesse, and will
soon shew it selfe in all the rest of the branches, whereby the plant
will quickly be lost: to preserue it therefore, you shall betime,
before it be runne too farre, (for otherwise it is impossible to saue
it) either couer all or most of the branches with fresh earth, or else
take the fairest slippes from it, as many as you can possibly, and
cast them into a pot or tubbe with water, and let them there abide for
two or three daies at the least: the first way hath recouered many,
being taken in time. Thus you shall see them recouer their former
stiffenesse and colour, and then you may plant them as you haue beene
heretofore directed; and although many of them may perish, yet shall
you haue some of them that will grow to continue the kinde againe.
The other or second way to encrease Gilloflowers by planting, is, as
I said before, by in-laying or laying downe the branches of them and
is a way of later inuention, and as frequently vsed, not onely for the
tawney or yellow Gilloflower, and all the varieties therof, but with
the other kinds of Gilloflowers, whereof experience hath shewed that
they will likewise take if they be so vsed; the manner whereof is thus:
You must choose out the youngest, likeliest, and lowest branches that
are nearest the ground (for the vpper branches will sooner breake at
the ioynt, than bend downe so low into the earth, without some pot
with earth raised vp vnto them) and cut it on the vnderside thereof
vpwards at the second ioynt next vnto the roote, to the middle of the
branch, and no more, and not quite thorough in any case, and then from
that second ioynt vnto the third; slit or cut the branch in the middle
longwise, that so it may be the more easily bended into the ground,
the cut ioynt seeming like the end of a slippe, when you haue bended
downe the branch where it is cut into the ground (which must bee done
very gently for feare of breaking) with a little sticke or two thrust
slopwise, crosse ouer it, keepe it downe within the earth, and raise vp
sufficient earth ouer it, that there it may lye and take roote, which
commonly will be effected within sixe weekes or two moneths in the
Summer time, and then (or longer if you doubt the time too short for it
to take sufficient roote) you may take or cut it away, and transplant
it where you thinke good, yet so as in any case you shadow it from the
heate of the Sunne, vntill it haue taken good hold in the ground. The
other way to encrease Gilloflowers, is by sowing the seede: It is not
vsuall with all sorts of Gilloflowers to giue seede, but such of them
as doe yeeld seede may be encreased thereby, in the same manner as is
here set downe. The Orange tawney Gilloflower and the varieties thereof
is the most vsuall kinde, (and it is a kinde by it selfe, how various
soeuer the plants be that rise from the seede) that doth giue seede,
and is sowne, and from thence ariseth so many varieties of colours,
both plaine and mixt, both single and double, that one can hardly set
them downe in writing: yet such as I haue obserued and marked, you
shall finde expressed in the Chapter of Gilloflowers in the worke
following. First therefore make choise of your seede that you intend
to sowe (if you doe not desire to haue as many more single flowers as
double) that it bee taken from double flowers, and not from single,
and from the best colours, howsoeuer some may boast to haue had double
and stript flowers from the seede of a single one; which if it were
so, yet one Swallow (as we say) maketh no Summer, nor a thing comming
by chance cannot bee reckoned for a certaine and constant rule; you
may be assured they will not vsually doe so: but the best, fairest,
and most double flowers come alwaies, or for the most part, from the
seede of those flowers that were best, fairest, and most double; and
I doe aduise you to take the best and most double: for euen from them
you shall haue single ones enow, you neede not sowe any worser sort.
And againe, see that your seede bee new, of the last yeares gathering,
and also that it was full ripe before it was gathered, lest you lose
your labour, or misse of your purpose, which is, to haue faire and
double flowers. Hauing now made choise of your seede, and prepared you
a bedde to sowe them on, the earth whereof must be rich and good, and
likewise sifted to make it the finer; for the better it is, the better
shall your profit and pleasure bee: hereon, being first made leuell,
plaine, and smooth, sowe your seede somewhat thinne, and not too thicke
in any case, and as euenly as you can, that they be not too many in one
place, and too few in another, which afterwards couer with fine sifted
earth ouer them about one fingers thicknesse; let this be done in the
middle of Aprill, if the time of the yeare be temperate, and not too
cold, or else stay vntill the end of the moneth: after they are sprung
vp and growne to be somewhat bigge, let them bee drawne forth that are
too close and neare one vnto another, and plant them in such place
where they shall continue, so that they stand halfe a yard of ground
distance asunder, which after the planting, let be shadowed for a time,
as is before specified; and this may bee done in the end of Iuly, or
sooner if there be cause. I haue not set downe in all this discourse of
planting, transplanting, sowing, setting, &c. any mention of watering
those slips or plants, not doubting but that euery ones reason will
induce them to thinke, that they cannot prosper without watering: But
let this Caueat be a sufficient remembrance vnto you, that you neuer
water any of these Gilloflowers, nor yet indeede any other fine herbe
or plant with cold water, such as you haue presently before drawne out
from a pumpe or Well, &c. but with such water as hath stood open in
the aire in a cisterne, tubbe, or pot, for one whole day at the least;
if it be two or three daies it will be neuer the worse, but rather the
better, as I haue related before: yet take especiall heede that you doe
not giue them too much to ouer-glut them at any time, but temperately
to irrorate, bedew or sprinkle them often. From the seedes of these
Gilloflowers hath risen both white, red, blush, stamell, tawny lighter
and sadder, marbled, speckled, striped, flaked, and that in diuers
manners, both single and double flowers, as you shall see them set
downe in a more ample manner in the Chapter of Gilloflowers. And thus
much for their encrease by the two wayes of planting and sowing: For as
for a third way, by grafting one into or vpon another, I know none such
to be true, nor to be of any more worth than an old Wiues tale, both
nature, reason, and experience, all contesting against such an idle
fancy, let men make what ostentation they please. It now resteth, that
we also shew you the manner how to preserue them, as well in Summer
from all noysome and hurtfull things, as in the Winter and Spring from
the sharp and chilling colds, and the sharpe and bitter killing windes
in March. The hurtfull things in the Summer are especially these,
too much heate of the Sunne which scorcheth them, which you must be
carefull to preuent, by placing boughes, boords, clothes or mats, &c.
before them, if they bee in the ground; or else if they bee in pots,
to remoue them into the shadow, to giue them refreshing from the
heate, and giue them water also for their life: too much water, or too
little is another annoyance, which you must order as you see there
is iust cause, by withholding or giuing them water gently out of a
watering pot, and not cast on by dishfuls: Some also to water their
Gilloflowers, vse to set their pots into tubbes or pots halfe full of
water, that so the water may soake in at the lower holes in each flower
pot, to giue moisture to the roots of the Gilloflowers onely, without
casting any water vpon the leaues, and assuredly it is an excellent way
to moisten the rootes so sufficiently at one time, that it doth saue a
great deale of paines many other times. Earwickes are a most infestuous
vermine, to spoyle the whole beauty of your flowers, and that in one
night or day; for these creatures delighting to creepe, into any
hollow or shadowie place, doe creepe into the long greene pods of the
Gilloflowers, and doe eate away the white bottomes of their leaues,
which are sweete, whereby the leaues of the flowers being loose, doe
either fall away of themselues before, or when they are gathered, or
handled, or presently wither within the pods before they are gathered,
and blowne away with the winde. To auoide which inconuenience, many
haue deuised many waies and inuentions to destroy them, as pots with
double verges or brimmes, containing a hollow gutter betweene them,
which being filled with water, will not suffer these small vermine to
passe ouer it to the Gilloflowers to spoile them. Others haue vsed old
shooes, and such like hollow things to bee set by them to take them in:
but the best and most vsuall things now vsed, are eyther long hollow
canes, or else beasts hoofes, which being turned downe vpon stickes
ends set into the ground, or into the pots of earth, will soone drawe
into them many Earwickes, lying hid therein from sunne, winde, and
raine, and by care and diligence may soone bee destroyed, if euery
morning and euening one take the hoofes gently off from the stickes,
and knocking them against the ground in a plain allie, shake out all
the Earwicks that are crept into them, which quickly with ones foot may
be trode to peeces. For sodain blasting with thunder and lightening,
or fierce sharp windes, &c. I know no other remedy, vnlesse you can
couer them therefrom when you first foresee the danger, but patiently
to abide the losse, whatsoeuer some haue aduised, to lay litter about
them to auoide blasting; for if any shall make tryall thereof, I am
in doubt, he shall more endanger his rootes thereby, being the Summer
time, when any such feare of blasting is, than any wise saue them from
it, or doe them any good. For the Winter preseruation of them, some
haue aduised to couer them with Bee-hiues, or else with small Willow
stickes, prickt crossewise into the ground ouer your flowers, and bowed
archwise, and with litter laid thereon, to couer the Gilloflowers
quite ouer, after they haue been sprinkled with sope ashes and lyme
mixt together: and this way is commended by some that haue written
thereof, to be such an admirable defence vnto them in Winter, that
neither Ants, nor Snailes, nor Earwickes shall touch them, because of
the sope ashes and lyme, and neyther frosts nor storms shall hurt them,
because of the litter which so well will defend them; and hereby also
your Gilloflowers will bee ready to flower not onely in the Spring
very early, but euen all the Winter. But whosoeuer shall follow these
directions, may peraduenture finde them in some part true, as they are
there set downe for the Winter time, and while they are kept close and
couered; but let them bee assured, that all such plants, or the most
part of them, will certainely perish and dye before the Summer be at an
end: for the sope ashes and lyme will burne vp and spoile any herbe;
and againe it is impossible for any plant that is kept so warme in
Winter, to abide eyther the cold or the winde in the Spring following,
or any heate of the Sun, but that both of them will scorch them, and
carry them quite away. One great hurt vnto them, and to all other
herbes that wee preserue in Winter, is to suffer the snow to lye vpon
them any time after it is fallen, for that it doth so chill them, that
the Sunne afterward, although in Winter, doth scorch them and burne
them vp: looke therefore vnto your Gilloflowers in those times, and
shake or strike off the snow gently off from them, not suffering it to
abide on them any day or night if you can; for assure your selfe, if it
doth not abide on them, the better they will be. The frosts likewise
is another great annoyance vnto them, to corrupt the rootes, and to
cause them to swell, rot, and break: to preuent which inconuenience, I
would aduise you to take the straw or litter of your horse stable, and
lay some thereof about euery roote of your Gilloflowers (especially
those of the best account) close vnto them vpon the ground, but be as
carefull as you can, that none thereof lye vpon the greene leaues,
or as little as may be, and by this onely way haue they been better
defended from the frosts that spoile them in Winter, then by any other
that I haue seen or knowne. The windes in March, and Sunneshine dayes
then, are one of the greatest inconueniences that happeneth vnto them;
for they that haue had hundreds of plants, that haue kept faire and
greene all the Winter vntill the beginning or middle of March, before
the end thereof, haue had scarce one of many, that either hath not
vtterly perished, or been so tainted, that quickly after haue not been
lost; which hath happened chiefly by the neglect of these cautions
before specified, or in not defending them from the bitter sharp windes
and sunne in this moneth of March. You shall therefore for their better
preseruation, besides the litter laid about the rootes, which I aduise
you not to remoue as yet, shelter them somewhat from the windes, with
eyther bottomlesse pots, pales, or such like things, to keep away the
violent force both of windes and sun for that moneth, and for some
time before & after it also: yet so, that they be not couered close
aboue, but open to receiue ayre & raine. Some also vse to wind withes
of hey or straw about the rootes of their Gilloflowers, and fasten
them with stickes thrust into the ground, which serue very well in the
stead of the other. Thus haue I shewed you the whole preseruation of
these worthy and dainty flowers, with the whole manner of ordering them
for their encrease: if any one haue any other better way, I shall be
as willing to learne it of them, as I haue beene to giue them or any
others the knowledge of that I haue here set downe.




CHAP. IX.

_That there is not any art whereby any flower may be made to grow
double, that was naturally single, nor of any other sent or colour than
it first had by nature; nor that the sowing or planting of herbes one
deeper than other, will cause them to be in flower one after another,
euery moneth in the yeare._


The wonderfull desire that many haue to see faire, double, and sweete
flowers, hath transported them beyond both reason and nature, feigning
and boasting often of what they would haue, as if they had it. And I
thinke, from this desire and boasting hath risen all the false tales
and reports, of making flowers double as they list, and of giuing them
colour and sent as they please, and to flower likewise at what time
they will, I doubt not, but that some of these errours are ancient, and
continued long by tradition, and others are of later inuention: and
therefore the more to be condemned, that men of wit and iudgement in
these dayes should expose themselues in their writings, to be rather
laughed at, then beleeued for such idle tales. And although in the
contradiction of them, I know I shall vndergoe many calumnies, yet
notwithstanding, I will endeauour to set downe and declare so much, as
I hope may by reason perswade many in the truth, although I cannot
hope of all, some being so strongly wedded to their owne will, and the
errours they haue beene bred in, that no reason may alter them. First
therefore I say, that if there were any art to make some flowers to
grow double, that naturally were single, by the same art, all sorts of
flowers that are single by nature, may be made to grow double: but the
sorts of flowers that are single by nature, whereof some are double,
were neuer made double by art; for many sorts abide still single,
whereof there was neuer seene double: and therefore there is no such
art in any mans knowledge to bring it to passe. If any man shall say,
that because there are many flowers double, whereof there are single
also of the same kinde, as for example, Violets, Marigolds, Daisyes,
Daffodils, Anemones, and many other, that therefore those double
flowers were so made by the art of man: _viz._ by the obseruation of
the change of the Moone, the constellations or coniunctions of Planets,
or some other Starres or celestiall bodies. Although I doe confesse
and acknowledge, that I thinke some constellations, and peraduenture
changes of the Moone, &c. were appointed by the God of nature, as
conducing and helping to the making of those flowers double, that
nature hath so produced, yet I doe deny, that any man hath or shall
euer be able to proue, that it was done by any art of man, or that any
man can tell the true causes and seasons, what changes of the Moone,
or constellations of the Planets, wrought together for the producing
of those double flowers, or can imitate nature, or rather the God of
nature, to doe the like. If it shall bee demanded, From whence then
came these double flowers that we haue, if they were not so made by
art? I answer, that assuredly all such flowers did first grow wilde,
and were so found double, as they doe now grow in Gardens, but for
how long before they were found they became double, no man can tell;
we onely haue them as nature hath produced them, and so they remaine.
Againe, if any shall say, that it is likely that these double flowers
were forced so to be, by the often planting and transplanting of them,
because it is obserued in most of them, that if they stand long in
any one place, and not be often remoued, they will grow still lesse
double, and in the end turne single. I doe confesse, that _Facilior
est descensus quàm ascensus_, and that the vnfruitfulnesse of the
ground they are planted in, or the neglect or little care had of them,
or the growing of them too thicke or too long, are oftentimes a cause
of the diminishing of the flowers doublenesse; but withall you shall
obserue, that the same rootes that did beare double flowers (and not
any other that neuer were double before) haue returned to their former
doublenesse againe, by good ordering and looking vnto: single flowers
haue only beene made somewhat fairer or larger, by being planted in
the richer and more fruitfull ground of the Garden, than they were
found wilde by nature; but neuer made to grow double, as that which
is naturally so found of it selfe: For I will shew you mine owne
experience in the matter. I haue been as inquisitiue as any man might
be, with euery one I knew, that made any such report, or that I thought
could say any thing therein, but I neuer could finde any one, that
could assuredly resolue me, that he knew certainly any such thing to
be done: all that they could say was but report, for the obseruation
of the Moone, to remoue plants before the change, that is, as some
say, the full of the Moone, others the new Moone, whereupon I haue
made tryall at many times, and in many sorts of plants, accordingly,
and as I thought fit, by planting & transplanting them, but I could
neuer see the effect desired, but rather in many of them the losse of
my plants. And were there indeed such a certaine art, to make single
flowers to grow double, it would haue beene knowne certainly to some
that would practise it, and there are so many single flowers, whereof
there were neuer any of the kinde seene double, that to produce such of
them to be double, would procure both credit and coyne enough to him
that should vse it; but _Vltra posse non est esse_: and therefore let
no man beleeue any such reports, bee they neuer so ancient; for they
are but meere tales and fables. Concerning colours and sents, the many
rules and directions extant in manie mens writings, to cause flowers
to grow yellow, red, greene, or white, that neuer were so naturally,
as also to be of the sent of Cinamon, Muske, &c. would almost perswade
any, that the matters thus set downe by such persons, and with some
shew of probability, were constant and assured proofes thereof: but
when they come to the triall, they all vanish away like smoake. I will
in a few words shew you the matters and manners of their proceedings to
effect this purpose: First (they say) if you shall steepe your seedes
in the lees of red Wine, you shall haue the flowers of those plants to
be of a purple colour. If you will haue Lillies or Gilloflowers to be
of a Scarlet red colour, you shall put Vermillion or Cynaber betweene
the rinde and the small heads growing about the roote: if you will
haue them blew, you shall dissolue Azur or Byse between the rinde and
the heads: if yellow, Orpiment: if greene, Vardigrease, and thus of
any other colour. Others doe aduise to open the head of the roote,
and poure into it any colour dissolued, so that there be no fretting
or corroding thing therein for feare of hurting the roote, and looke
what colour you put in, iust such or neare vnto it shall the colour of
the flower bee. Some againe doe aduise to water the plants you would
haue changed, with such coloured liquor as you desire the flower to be
of, and they shall grow to be so. Also to make Roses to bee yellow,
that you should graft a white Rose (some say a Damaske) vpon a Broome
stalke, and the flower will be yellow, supposing because the Broome
flower is yellow, therefore the Rose will be yellow. Some affirme the
like, if a Rose be grafted on a Barbery bush, because both the blossome
and the barke of the Barbery is yellow, &c. In the like manner for
sents, they haue set downe in their writings, that by putting Cloues,
Muske, Cinamon, Benzoin, or any other such sweete thing, bruised with
Rose water, betweene the barke and the body of trees, the fruit of
them will smell and taste of the same that is put vnto them; and if
they bee put vnto the toppe of the rootes, or else bound vnto the head
of the roote, they will cause the flowers to smell of that sent the
matter put vnto them is of: as also to steep the seeds of Roses, and
other plants in the water of such like sweet things, and then to sowe
them, and water them morning and euening with such like liquor, vntill
they be growne vp; besides a number of such like rules and directions
set downe in bookes so confidently, as if the matters were without all
doubt or question: whenas without all doubt and question I will assure
you, that they are all but meere idle tales & fancies, without all
reason or truth, or shadow of reason or truth: For sents and colours
are both such qualities as follow the essence of plants, euen as formes
are also; and one may as well make any plant to grow of what forme
you will, as to make it of what sent or colour you will; and if any
man can forme plants at his will and pleasure, he can doe as much as
God himselfe that created them. For the things they would adde vnto
the plants to giue them colour, are all corporeall, or of a bodily
substance, and whatsoeuer should giue any colour vnto a liuing and
growing plant, must be spirituall: for no solide corporeall substance
can ioyne it selfe with the life and essence of an herbe or tree, and
the spirituall part of the colour thereof is not the same with the
bodily substance, but is a meere vapour that riseth from the substance,
and seedeth the plant, whereby it groweth, so that there is no ground
or colour of reason, that a substantiall colour should giue colour to a
growing herbe or tree: but for sent (which is a meere vapour) you will
say there is more probability. Yet consider also, that what sweete sent
soeuer you binde or put vnto the rootes of herbes or trees, must be
either buried, or as good as buried in the earth, or barke of the tree,
whereby the substance will in a small time corrupt and rot, and before
it can ioyne it selfe with the life, spirit, and essence of the plant,
the sent also will perish with the substance: For no heterogeneall
things can bee mixed naturally together, as Iron and Clay; and no
other thing but homogeneall, can be nourishment or conuertible into
the substance of man or beast: And as the stomach of man or beast
altereth both formes, sents, and colours of all digestible things; so
whatsoeuer sent or colour is wholsome, and not poysonfull to nature,
being receiued into the body of man or beast, doth neither change the
bloud or skinne into that colour or sent was receiued: no more doth
any colour or sent to any plant; for the plants are onely nourished
by the moisture they draw naturally vnto them, be it of wine or any
other liquor is put vnto them, and not by any corporeal substance, or
heterogeneall vapour or sent, because the earth like vnto the stomach
doth soone alter them, before they are conuerted into the nature and
substance of the plant. Now for the last part I vndertooke to confute,
that no man can by art make all flowers to spring at what time of
the yeare hee will; although, as I haue here before shewed there are
flowers for euery moneth of the yeare, yet I hope there is not any one,
that hath any knowledge in flowers and gardening, but knoweth that the
flowers that appeare and shew themselues in the seuerall moneths of
the yeare, are not one and the same, and so made to flower by art; but
that they are seuerall sorts of plants, which will flower naturally
and constantly in the same moneths one yeare, that they vse to doe in
another, or with but little alteration, if the yeares proue not alike
kindly: As for example, those plants that doe flower in Ianuary and
February, will by no art of industry of man be caused to flower in
Summer or in Autumne; and those that flower in Aprill and May, will not
flower in Ianuary or February; or those in Iuly, August, &c. either
in the Winter or Spring: but euery one knoweth their owne appointed
naturall times, which they constantly obserue and keepe, according
to the temperature of the yeare, or the temper of the climate, being
further North or South, to bring them on earlier or later, as it doth
with all other fruits, flowers, and growing greene herbes, &c. except
that by chance, some one or other extraordinarily may be hindered in
their due season of flowring, and so giue their flowers out of time, or
else to giue their flowers twice in the yeare, by the superaboundance
of nourishment, of the mildnesse of the season, by moderate showers of
raine, &c. as it sometimes also happeneth with fruits, which chance,
as it is seldome, and not constant, so we then terme it but _Lusus
naturæ_: or else by forcing them in hot stoues, which then will perish,
when they haue giuen their flowers or fruits. It is not then, as some
haue written, the sowing of the seedes of Lillies, or any other plants
a foote deepe, or halfe a foote deepe, or two inches deepe, that will
cause them to be in flower one after, another, as they are sowne euery
moneth of the yeare; for it were too grosse to thinke, that any man of
reason and iudgement would so beleeue. Nor is it like wise in the power
of any man, to make the same plants to abide a moneth, two, or three,
or longer in their beauty of flowring, then naturally they vse to doe;
for I thinke that were no humane art, but a supernaturall worke. For
nature still bendeth and tendeth to perfection, that is, after flowring
to giue fruit or seede; nor can it bee hindered in the course thereof
without manifest danger of destruction, euen as it is in all other
fruit-bearing creatures, which stay no longer, then their appointed
time is naturall vnto them, without apparent damage. Some things I
grant may be so ordered in the planting, that according to that order
and time which is obserued in their planting, they shall shew forth
their faire flowers, and they are Anemones, which will in that manner,
that I haue shewed in the worke following, flower in seuerall moneths
of the yeare; which thing as it is incident to none or very few other
plants, and is found out but of late, so likewise is it knowne but vnto
a very few. Thus haue I shewed you the true solution of these doubts:
And although they haue not beene amplified with such Philosophicall
arguments and reasons, as one of greater learning might haue done, yet
are they truely and sincerely set downe, that they may serue _tanquam
galeatum_, against all the calumnies and obiections of wilfull and
obdurate persons, that will not be reformed. As first, that all double
flowers were so found wilde, being the worke of nature alone, and not
the art of any man, by planting or transplanting, at or before the new
or full Moone, or any other obseruation of time, that hath caused the
flower to grow double, that naturally was single: Secondly, that the
rules and directions, to cause flowers to bee of contrary or different
colours or sents, from that they were or would be naturally, are meere
fancies of men, without any ground of reason of truth. And thirdly,
that there is no power or art in man, to cause flowers to shew their
beauty diuers moneths before their naturall time, nor to abide in their
beauty longer then the appointed naturall time for euery one of them.




THE GARDEN OF PLEASANT FLOWERS.




CHAP. I.

_Corona Imperialis._   The Crowne Imperiall.


Because the Lilly is the more stately flower among manie: and amongst
the wonderfull varietie of Lillies, knowne to vs in these daies, much
more then in former times, whereof some are white, others blush, some
purple, others red or yellow, some spotted, others without spots, some
standing vpright, others hanging or turning downewards, The Crowne
Imperiall for his stately beautifulness, deserueth the first place in
this our Garden of delight, to be here entreated of before all other
Lillies; but because it is so well knowne to most persons, being in a
manner euery where common, I shall neede onely to giue you a relation
of the chiefe parts thereof (as I intend in such other things) which
are these: The roote is yellowish on the outside, composed of fewer,
but much thicker scales, then any other Lilly but the Persian, and
doth grow sometimes to be as great as a pretty bigge childes head,
but somewhat flat withall, from the sides whereof, and not from the
bottome, it shooteth forth thicke long fibres, which perish euery
yeare, hauing a hole in the midst thereof, at the end of the yeare,
when the old stalke is dry and withered, and out of the which a new
stalke doth spring againe (from a bud or head to be seen within the
hollownesse on the one side) the yeare following: the stalke then
filling vp the hollownesse, riseth vp three or foure, foote high,
being great, round, and of a purplish colour at the bottome, but
greene aboue, beset from thence to the middle thereof with many long
and broad greene leaues, very like to the leaues of our ordinary white
Lilly, but somewhat shorter and narrower, confusedly without order,
and from the middle is bare or naked without leaues, for a certaine
space vpwards, and then beareth foure, sixe, or tenne flowers, more
or lesse, according to the age of the plant, and the fertility of
the soyle where it groweth: The buddes at the first appearing are
whitish, standing vpright among a bush or tuft of greene leaues,
smaller then those below, and standing aboue the flowers, after a
while they turne themselues, and hang downewards euerie one vpon his
owne footestalke, round about the great stemme or stalke, sometimes
of an euen depth, and other while one lower or higher than another,
which flowers are neare the forme of an ordinary Lilly, yet somewhat
lesser and closer, consisting of sixe leaues of an Orange colour,
striped with purplish lines and veines, which adde a great grace to
the flowers: At the bottome of the flower next vnto the stalke, euery
leafe thereof hath on the outside a certaine bunch or eminence, of a
darke purplish colour, and on the inside there lyeth in those hollow
bunched places, certaine cleare drops of water like vnto pearles, of a
very sweete taste almost like sugar: in the midst of each flower is a
long white stile or pointell, forked or diuided at the end, and sixe
white chiues tipt with yellowish pendents, standing close about it:
after the flowers are past, appeare sixe square seede vessels standing
vpright, winged as it were or welted on the edges, yet seeming but
three square, because each couple of those welted edges are ioyned
closer together, wherein are contained broad, flat, and thinne seedes,
of a pale brownish colour, like vnto other Lillies, but much greater
and thicker also. The stalke of this plant doth oftentimes grow flat,
two, three, or foure fingers broad, and then beareth many more flowers,
but for the most part smaller then when it beareth round stalkes. And
sometimes it happeneth the stalke to be diuided at the top, carrying
two or three tufts of greene leaues, without any flowers on them. And
sometimes likewise, to beare two or three rowes or crownes of flowers
one aboue another vpon one stalke, which is seldome and scarce seene,
and besides, is but meere accidentall: the whole plant and euery part
thereof, as well rootes, as leaues and flowers, doe smell somewhat
strong as it were the fauour of a Foxe, so that if any doe but come
neare it, he cannot but smell it, which yet is not vnwholsome.

I haue not obserued any variety in the colour of this flower, more then
that it will be fairer in a cleare open ayre, and paler, or as it were
blasted in a muddy or smoakie ayre. And although some haue boasted of
one with white flowers, yet I could neuer heare that any such hath
endured in one vniforme colour.


        The Place.

        This plant was first brought from Constantinople into these
        Christian Countries, and by the relation of some that sent it,
        groweth naturally in Persia.


        The Time.

        It flowereth most commonly in the end of March, if the weather
        be milde, and springeth not out of the ground vntill the end
        of February, or beginning of March, so quicke it is in the
        springing: the heads with seed are ripe in the end of May.


        The Names.

        It is of some called _Lilium Persicum_, the Persian Lilly: but
        because wee haue another, which is more vsually called by that
        name, as shall be shewed in the next Chapter, I had rather
        with Alphonsus Pancius the Duke of Florence his Physitian,
        (who first sent the figure thereof vnto Mᶴʳ. Iohn de Brancion)
        call it _Corona Imperialis_, the Crowne Imperiall, then by any
        other name, as also for that this name is now more generally
        receiued. It hath been sent also by the name _Tusai_, and
        _Tuschai_, and _Turfani_, or _Turfanda_, being, as it is like,
        the Turkish names.


        The Vertues.

        For any Physicall Vertues that are in it, I know of none, nor
        haue heard that any hath been found out: notwithstanding the
        strong sent would perswade it might be applyed to good purpose.




CHAP. II.

_Lilium Persicum._   The Persian Lilly.


The roote of the Persian Lilly is very like vnto the root of the Crowne
Imperiall, and losing his fibres in like maner euery yeare, hauing a
hole therin likewise where the old stalke grew, but whiter, rounder,
and a little longer, smaller, and not stinking at all like it, from
whence springeth vp a round whitish greene stalke, not much lower
than the Crowne Imperiall, but much smaller, beset from the bottome
to the middle thereof, with many long and narrow leaues, of a whitish
or blewish greene colour, almost like to the leafe of a Tulipa: from
the middle vpwards, to the toppe of the stalke, stand many flowers one
aboue another round about it, with leaues at the foote of euery one of
them, each whereof is pendulous or hanging downe the head, like vnto
the Crowne Imperiall, and not turning vp any of the flowers againe,
but smaller than in any other kinde of Lilly, yea not so bigge as
the flower of a Fritillaria, consisting of sixe leaues a peece, of a
dead or ouerworne purplish colour, hauing in the midst a small long
pointell, with certaine chiues tipt with yellow pendents: after the
flowers are past (which abide open a long time, and for the most part
flower by degrees, the lowest first, and so vpwards) if the weather be
temperate, come sixe square heads or seede vessels, seeming to be but
three square, by reason of the wings, very like to the heads of the
Crowne Imperiall, but smaller and shorter, wherein are contained such
like flat seed, but smaller also, and of a darker colour.

        The Place.

        This was, as it is thought, first brought from Persia vnto
        Constantinople, and from thence, sent vnto vs by the meanes of
        diuers Turkie Merchants, and in especiall, by the procurement
        of Mʳ. Nicholas Lete, a worthy Merchant, and a louer of all
        faire flowers.


        The Time.

        It springeth out of the ground very neare a moneth before
        the Crowne Imperiall, but doth not flower till it bee quite
        past (that is to say) not vntill the latter end of Aprill, or
        beginning of May: the seed (when it doth come to perfection, as
        it seldome doth) is not ripe vntill Iuly.


        The Names.

        It hath been sent by the name of _Pennachio Persiano_, and
        wee thereupon doe most vsually call it _Lilium Persicum_,
        The Persian Lilly. Clusius saith it hath been sent into the
        Low Countries vnder the name of Susam giul, and he thereupon
        thinking it came from Susis in Persia, called it _Lilium
        Susianum_, The Lilly of Susis.


        The Vertues.

        Wee haue not yet heard, that this hath beene applyed for any
        Physicall respect.




CHAP. III.

_Martagon Imperiale, siue Lilium Montanum maius._
The Martagon Imperiall.


Vnder this title of _Lilium Montanum_, or _Lilium Siluestre_, I do
comprehend only those kindes of Lillies, which carry diuers circles
of greene leaues set together at certaine distances, round about the
stalke, and not sparsedly as the two former, and as other kindes that
follow, doe. And although there bee many of this sort, yet because
their chiefest difference is in the colour of the flower, wee will
containe them all in one Chapter, and begin with the most stately of
them all, because of the number of flowers it beareth vpon one stalke.
The Imperiall Lilly hath a scaly roote, like vnto all the rest of the
Lillies, but of a paler yellow colour, closely compact or set together,
being short and small oftentimes, in comparison of the greatnesse of
the stemme growing from it. The stalke is brownish and round at the
bottome, and sometimes flat from the middle vpwards, three foote high
or more, beset at certaine distances with rondles or circles of many
broad leaues, larger and broader for the most part than any other of
this kinde, and of a darke green colour: It hath two or three, and
sometimes foure of these rondles or circles of leaues, and bare without
any leafe betweene; but aboue toward the tops of the stalkes, it hath
here and there some leaues vpon it, but smaller than any of the other
leaues: at the toppe of the stalke come forth many flowers, sometime
three or foure score, thicke thrust, or confusedly set together, and
not thinne or sparsedly one aboue another, as in the lesser of this
kinde of Mountaine Lilly. It hath been sometimes also obserued in this
kinde, that it hath borne manie flowers at three seuerall spaces of
the stalke, one aboue another, which hath made a goodly shew; each
flower whereof is pendulous, hanging downe, and each leafe of the
flower turning vp againe, being thicke or fleshy, of a fine delayed
purple colour, spotted with many blackish or brownish spots, of a very
pleasant sweet sent, which maketh it the more acceptable: in the middle
of the flower hangeth downe a stile or pointell, knobbed or buttoned at
the end with sixe yellow chiues, tipt with loose pendents of an Orient
red or Vermillion colour, which will easily sticke like dust vpon any
thing that toucheth them: the heads or seede vessels are small and
round, with small edges about them, wherein is contained flat browne
seede like other Lillies, but lesser. This root is very apt to encrease
or set of, as we call it, wherby the plant seldome commeth to so great
a head of flowers, but riseth vp with many stalkes, and then carry
fewer flowers.

[Sidenote: _Martagon Imperiale flore non punctato._]

Of this kinde there is sometimes one found, that beareth flowers
without any spots: the leaues whereof and stalke likewise are paler,
but not else differing.


_Martagon flore albo._   The White Martagon.

We haue also some other of this kind, the first wherof hath his stalke
& leafe greener than the former, the stalke is a little higher, but not
bearing so thicke a head of flowers, although much more plentifull than
the lesser Mountaine Lilly, being altogether of a fine white colour,
without any spots, or but very few, and that but sometimes also: the
pendents in the middle of this flower are not red, as the former, but
yellow; the roote of this, and of the other two that follow, are of a
pale yellow colour, the cloues or scales of them being brittle, and
not closely compact, yet so as if two, and sometimes three scales or
cloues grew one vpon the head or vpperpart of another; which difference
is a speciall note to know these three kindes, from any other kinde
of Mountaine Lilly, as in all old rootes that I haue seene, I haue
obserued, as also in them that are reasonably well growne, but in the
young rootes it is not yet so manifest.


_Martagon flore albo maculato._   The White spotted Martagon.

The second is like vnto the first in all things, saue in this, that
the flowers hereof are not altogether so white, and besides hath many
reddish spots on the inside of the leaues of the flower, and the stalke
also is not so greene but brownish.


_Martagon flore carneo._   The blush Martagon.

A third sort there is of this kinde, whole flowers are wholly of a
delayed flesh colour, with many spots on the flowers, and this is the
difference hereof from the former.


_Lilium Montanum siue siluestre minus._   The lesser Mountaine Lilly.

The lesser Mountaine Lilly is so like in root vnto the greater that is
first described, that it is hard to distinguish them asunder; but when
this is sprung vp out of the ground, which is a moneth after the first:
it also carrieth his leaues in rondles about the stalke, although not
altogether so great nor so many. The flowers are more thinly set on the
stalkes one aboue another, with more distance betweene each flower than
the former, and are of a little deeper flesh colour or purple, spotted
in the same manner. The buds or heads of flowers, in some of these
before they be blowne, are hoary white, or hairie, whereas in others,
there is no hoarinesse at all, but the buddes are smooth and purplish:
in other things this differeth not from the former.

[Sidenote: _Lilium Montanum non maculatum._]

Of this sort also there is one that hath but few spots on the flowers,
whose colour is somewhat paler than the other.


[Illustration:

   1 _Martagon flore albo._ The white Martagon.
   2 _Martagon siue Lilium Canadense maculatum._ The spotted Martagon,
        or Lilly of Canada.
   3 _Martagon Pomponeum._ The Martagon Pompony, or early red Martagon.
]


_Martagon Canadense maculatum._   The spotted Martagon of Canada.

Although this strange Lilly hath not his flowers hanging downe, and
turning vp again, as the former kinds set forth in this Chapter, yet
because the green leaues stand at seuerall ioynts as they do, I must
needs insert it here, not knowing where more fitly to place it. It hath
a small scaly roote, with many small long fibres thereat, from whence
riseth vp a reasonable great stalke, almost as high as any of the
former, bearing at three or foure distances many long and narrow greene
leaues, but not so many or so broad as the former, with diuers ribbes
in them: from among the vppermost rundle of leaues breake forth foure
or fiue flowers together, euery one standing on a long slender foote
stalke, being almost as large as a red Lilly, but a little bending
downewards, and of a faire yellow colour, spotted on the inside with
diuers blackish purple spots or strakes, hauing a middle pointell, and
sixe chiues, with pendents on them.


        The Place.

        All these Lillies haue been found in the diuers Countries of
        Germany, as Austria, Hungaria, Pannonia, Stiria, &c. and are
        all made Denisons in our London Gardens, where they flourish as
        in their owne naturall places. The last was brought into France
        from Canada by the French Colonie, and from thence vnto vs.


        The Time.

        They flower about the later end of Iune for the most part, yet
        the first springeth out of the ground a moneth at the least
        before the other, which are most vsually in flower before it,
        like vnto the Serotine Tulipas, all of them being early vp, and
        neuer the neere.


        The Names.

        The first is vsually called _Martagon Imperiale_, the Imperiall
        Martagon, and is _Lilium Montanum maius_, the greatest
        Mountaine Lilly; for so it deserueth the name, because of the
        number of flowers vpon a head or stalke. Some haue called it
        _Lilium Sarasenicum_, and some _Hemerocallis_, but neither of
        them doth so fitly agree vnto it.

        The second is _Lilium Montanum maius flore albo_, and of some
        _Martagon Imperiale flore albo_, but most vsually _Martagon
        flore albo_, the white Martagon. The second sort of this second
        kinde, is called _Martagon flore albo maculato_, the spotted
        white Martagon. And the third, _Martagon flore carneo_, the
        blush Martagon.

        The third kinde is called _Lilium Montanum_, the Mountaine
        Lilly, and some adde the title _minus_, the lesser, to know it
        more distinctly from the other. Some also _Lilium Siluestre_,
        as Clusius, and some others, and of Matthiolus _Martagon_. Of
        diuers women here in England, from the Dutch name, Lilly of
        Nazareth. The last hath his title _Americanum & Canadense_, and
        in English accordingly.




CHAP. IV.

1. _Martagon Pomponeum siue Lilium rubrum præcox, vel Lilium
Macedonicum._
The early red Martagon, or Martagon Pompony.


As in the former Chapter we described vnto you such Lillies, whose
flowers being pendulous, turne their leaues backe againe, and haue
their greene leaues, set by spaces about the stalke: so in this wee
will set downe those sorts, which carry their greene leaues more
sparsedly, and all along the stalke, their flowers hanging downe,
and turning vp againe as the former, and begin with that which is of
greatest beauty, or at least of most rarity.

[Sidenote: 1. Martagon Pomponeum angusti folium praecox.]

1. This rare Martagon hath a scaly root closely compact, with broader
and thinner scales than others, in time growing very great, and of a
more deepe yellow colour then the former, from whence doth spring vp a
round greene stalke in some plants, and flat in others, two or three
foote high, bearing a number of small, long, and narrow greene leaues,
very like vnto the leaues of Pinkes, but greener, set very thicke
together, and without order about the stalke, vp almost vnto the toppe,
and lesser by degrees vpwards, where stand many flowers, according to
the age of the plant, and thriuing in the place where it groweth; in
those that are young, but a few, and more sparsedly, and in others that
are old many more, and thicker set: for I haue reckoned threescore
flowers and more, growing thicke together on one plant with mee, and an
hundred flowers on another: these flowers are of a pale or yellowish
red colour, and not so deep red as the red Martagon of Constantinople,
hereafter set down, nor fully so large: yet of the same fashion, that
is, euery flower hanging downe, and turning vp his leaues againe. It is
not so plentifull in bearing of seede as the other Lillies, but when it
doth, it differeth not but in being lesse.

[Sidenote: 2. Martagon angusti folium magis serotinum.]

There is another, whose greene leaues are not so thicke set on the
stalke, but else differeth not but in flowring a fortnight later.

[Sidenote: 3. Martagon Pomponeum latifolium praecox.]

There is another also of this kind, so like vnto the former in root,
stalk, flower, & maner of growing, that the difference is hardly
discerned; but consisteth chiefly in these two points: First, that the
leaues of this are a little broader and shorter then the former; and
secondly, that it beareth his flowers a fortnight earlier than the
first. In the colour or forme of the flower, there can no difference
bee discerned, nor (as I said) in any other thing. All these Lillies
doe spring very late out of the ground, euen as the yellow Martagons
doe, but are sooner in flower then any others.

[Sidenote: 4. Martagon flore phaeniceo.]

A fourth kinde hereof hath of late been knowne to vs, whose leaues are
broader and shorter than the last, and the flowers of a paler red,
tending to yellow, of some called a golden red colour: but flowreth not
so early as they.


2. _Lilium rubrum Byzantinum, siue Martagon Constantinopolitanum._
The red Martagon of Constantinople.

1. The red Martagon of Constantinople is become so common euery where,
and so well knowne to all louers of these delights, that I shall seeme
vnto them to lose time, to bestow many lines vpon it; yet because it
is so faire a flower, and was at the first so highly esteemed, it
deserueth his place and commendations, howsoeuer encreasing the plenty
hath not made it dainty. It riseth out of the ground early in the
spring, before many other Lillies, from a great thicke yellow scaly
root, bearing a round brownish stalke, beset with many faire greene
leaues confusedly thereon, but not so broad as the common white Lilly,
vpon the toppe whereof stand one, two, or three, or more flowers, vpon
long footestalkes, which hang downe their heads, and turne vp their
leaues againe, of an excellent red crimson colour, and sometimes paler,
hauing a long pointell in the middle, compassed with sixe whitish
chiues, tipt with loose yellow pendents, of a reasonable good sent,
but somewhat faint. It likewise beareth seede in heads, like vnto the
other, but greater.


_Martagon Constantinopolitanum maculatum._
The red spotted Martagon of Constantinople.

We haue another of this kinde, that groweth somewhat greater and
higher, with a larger flower, and of a deeper colour, spotted with
diuers blacke spots, or strakes and lines, as is to be seene in the
Mountaine Lillies, and in some other hereafter to be described; but is
not so in the former of this kinde, which hath no shew of spots at all.
The whole plant as it is rare, so it is of much more beauty than the
former.


2. _Martagon Pannonicum, siue Exoticum flore spadiceo._
The bright red Martagon of Hungarie.

Although this Martagon or Lilly bee of another Countrey, yet by reason
of the neerenesse both in leafe and flower vnto the former, may more
fitly be placed next vnto them, then in any other place. It hath his
roote very like the other, but the leaues are somewhat larger, and more
sparsedly set vpon the stalke, else not much vnlike: the flowers bend
downe, and turne vp their leaues againe, but somewhat larger, and of a
bright red, tending to an Orenge colour, that is, somewhat yellowish,
and not crimson, like the other.


3. _Martagon Luteum punctatum._   The Yellow spotted Martagon.

1. This Yellow Martagon hath a great scaly or cloued roote, and yellow,
like vnto all these sorts of turning Lillies, from whence springeth vp
a round greene strong stalke, three foote high at the least, confusedly
set with narrow long greene leaues, white on the edges vp to the very
toppe thereof almost, hauing diuers flowers on the head, turning vp
againe as the former doe, of a faint yellowish, or greenish yellow
colour, with many blacke spots or strakes about the middle of the leafe
of euery flower, and a forked pointell, with sixe chiues about it, tipt
with reddish pendents, of a heauie strong smell, not very pleasant to
many. It beareth seede very plentifully, in great heads, like vnto the
other former Lillies, but a little paler.


2. _Martagon Luteum non maculatum._   The Yellow Martagon without spots.

The other yellow Martagon differeth in no other thing from the former,
but onely that it hath no spots at all vpon any of the leaues of the
flowers; agreeing with the former, in colour, forme, height, and all
things else.


3. _Martagon Luteum serotinum._   The late flowring Yellow Martagon.

There is yet another yellow Martagon, that hath no other difference
then the time of his flowring, which is not vntill Iuly, vnlesse in
this, that the flower is of a deeper yellow colour.


        The Place.

        The knowledge of the first kindes of these early Martagons
        hath come from Italy, from whence they haue bin sent into the
        Low-Countries, and to vs, and, as it seemeth by the name,
        whereby they haue bin sent by some into these parts, his
        originall should be from the mountaines in Macedonia.

        The second sort is sufficiently knowne by his name, being first
        brought from Constantinople, his naturall place being not
        farre from thence, as it is likely. But the next sort of this
        second kinde, doth plainly tell vs his place of birth to be the
        mountaines of Pannonia or Hungarie.

        The third kindes grow on the Pyrenæan mountains, where they
        haue been searched out, and found by diuers louers of plants,
        as also in the Kingdome of Naples.


        The Time.

        The first early Martagons flower in the end of May, or
        beginning of Iune, and that is a moneth at the least before
        those that come from Constantinople, which is the second kinde.
        The two first yellow Martagons flower somewhat more early, then
        the early red Martagons, and sometimes at the same time with
        them. But the third yellow Martagon, as is said, flowreth a
        moneth later or more, and is in flower when the red Martagon of
        Constantinople flowreth. And although the early red and yellow
        Martagons, spring later then the other Martagons or Lillies,
        yet they are in flower before them.


        The Names.

        The first early red Lillies or Martagons haue beene sent vnto
        vs by seuerall names, as _Martagon Pomponeum_, and thereafter
        are called Martagon of Pompony, and also _Lilium_ or _Martagon
        Macedonicum_, the Lilly or Martagon of Macedonia. They are also
        called by Clusius _Lilium rubrum præcox_, the one _angustiore
        folio_, the other _latiore folio_. And the last of this kinde
        hath the title _flore phæniceo_ added or giuen vnto it, that
        is, the Martagon or Lilly of Macedonia with gold red flowers.

        The Martagons of Constantinople haue beene sent by the Turkish
        name _Zufiniare_, and is called _Martagon_, or _Lilium
        Byzantinum_ by some, and _Hemerocallis Chalcedonica_ by others;
        but by the name of the Martagon of Constantinople they are most
        commonly receiued with vs, with the distinction of _maculatum_
        to the one, to distinguish the sorts. The last kinde in this
        _classis_, hath his name in his title, as it hath been sent
        vnto vs.

        The Yellow Martagons are distinguished in their seuerall
        titles, as much as is conuenient for them.




CHAP. V.

_Lilium Aureum & Lilium Rubrum._   The Gold and Red Lillies.


There are yet some other kindes of red Lillies to bee described, which
differ from all the former, and remaine to be spoken of in this place.
Some of them grow high, and some lowe, some haue small knots, which wee
call bulbes, growing vpon the stalkes, at the ioynts of the leaues or
flowers, and some haue none: all which shall be intreated of in their
seuerall orders.


_Lilium pumilum cruentum._   The dwarfe red Lilly.

The dwarfe red Lilly hath a scaly roote, somewhat like vnto other
Lillies, but white, and not yellow at all, and the cloues or scales
thicker, shorter, and fewer in number, then in most of the former: the
stalke hereof is not aboue a foote and a halfe high, round and greene,
set confusedly with many faire and short greene leaues, on the toppe
of which doe stand sometimes but a few flowers, and sometimes many, of
a faire purplish red colour, and a little paler in the middle, euery
flower standing vpright, and not hanging downe, as in the former, on
the leaues whereof here and there are some blacke spots, lines or
markes, and in the middle of the flower a long pointell, with some
chiues about it, as is in the rest of these Lillies.

[Sidenote: _Lilium rubrum multiplici flore._]

This kinde is sometimes found to yeeld double flowers, as if all the
single flowers should grow into one, and so make it consist of many
leaues, which notwithstanding his so continuing sundry yeares, vpon
transplanting, will _redire ad ingenium_, that is, quickly come againe
to his old byas or forme.


[Illustration:

   1 _Martagon rubrum siue luteum._ The red or the yellow Martagon.
   2 _Lilium Bulbiferum._ The red bulbed Lilly.
   3 _Lilium aureum._ The gold red Lilly.
   4 _Lilium album._ The white Lilly.
]


_Lilium Aureum._   The Gold red Lilly.

The second red Lilly without bulbes groweth much higher then the first,
and almost as high as any other Lilly: the roote hereof is white and
scaly, the leaues are somewhat longer, and of a darke or sad greene
colour; the flowers are many and large, standing vpright as all these
sorts of red Lillies doe, of a paler red colour tending to an Orenge on
the inside, with many blacke spots and lines on them, as in the former,
and more yellow on the outside: the seede vessels are like vnto the
roundish heads of other Lillies, and so are the seedes in them likewise.


1. _Lilium minus bulbiferum._   The dwarfe bulbed Lilly.

The first of the Lillies that carrieth bulbes on the stalke, hath a
white scaly roote like the former; from whence riseth vp a small round
stalke, not much higher then the first dwarfe Lilly, seeming to be
edged, hauing many leaues thereon of a sad green colour set about it,
close thrust together: the greene heads for flowers, will haue a kind
of woollinesse on them, before the flowers begin to open, and betweene
these heads of flowers, as also vnder them, and among the vppermost
leaues, appeare small bulbes or heads, which being ripe if they be
put into the ground, or if they fall of themselues, will shoote forth
leaues, and beare flowers within two or three yeares like the mother
plant, and so will the bulbes of the other hereafter described: the
flowers of this Lilly are of a faire gold yellow colour, shadowed ouer
with a shew of purple, but not so red as the first, or the next to bee
described. This Lilly will shoote strings vnder ground, like as the
last red Lilly will doe also, whereat will grow white bulbed roots,
like the rootes of the mother plant, thereby quickly encreasing it
selfe.


2. _Lilium Cruentum bulbiferum._   The Fierie red bulbed Lilly.

The second bulbed Lilly riseth vp with his stalke as high as any of
these Lillies, carrying many long and narrow darke greene leaues about
it, and at the toppe many faire red flowers, as large or larger then
any of the former, and of a deeper red colour, with spots on them
likewise, hauing greater bulbes growing about the toppe of the stalke
and among the flowers, then any else.


_Lilium Cruentum flore pleno._   The Fierie red double Lilly.

The difference of this doth chiefly consist in the flower, which is
composed of manie leaues, as if many flowers went to make one, spotted
with black spots, and without any bulbes when it thus beareth, which is
but accidentall, as the former double Lilly is said to be.


3. _Lilium maius bulbiferum._   The greater bulbed red Lilly.

The third red Lilly with bulbes, riseth vp almost as high as the last,
and is the most common kinde we haue bearing bulbes. It hath many
leaues about the stalke, but not of so sad a greene colour as the
former: the flowers are of as pale a reddish yellow colour as any of
the former, and comming neerest vnto the colour of the Gold red Lilly.
This is more plentifull in bulbes, and in shooting strings, to encrease
rootes vnder ground, then the others.


        The Place.

        These Lillies doe all grow in Gardens, but their naturall
        places of growing is the Mountaines and the Vallies neere
        them in Italy, as Matthiolus saith: and in many Countries of
        Germany, as Hungarie, Austria, Stiria, and Bohemia, as Clusius
        and other doe report.


        The Time.

        They flower for the most part in Iune, yet the first of these
        is the earliest of all the rest.


        The Names.

        All these Lillies are called _Lilia Rubra_, Red Lillies:
        Some call them _Lilium Aureum_, _Lilium Purpureum_, _Lilium
        Puniceum_, _&_ _Lilium Cruentum_. Some also call them _Martagon
        Chimistarum_. Clusius calleth these bulbed Lillies _Martagon
        Bulbiferum_. It is thought to be _Hyacinthus Poetarum_, but I
        referre the discussing thereof to a fitter time. Wee haue, to
        distinguish them most fitly (as I take it) giuen their proper
        names in their seuerall titles.




CHAP. VI.

_Lilium Album._   The White Lilly.


Now remaineth onely the White Lilly, of all the whole family or stocke
of the Lillies, to bee spoken of, which is of two sorts. The one is our
common or vulgar White Lilly; and the other, that which was brought
from Constantinople.


_Lilium Album vulgare._   The ordinary White Lilly.

The ordinary White Lilly scarce needeth any description, it is so well
knowne, and so frequent in euery Garden; but to say somewhat thereof,
as I vse to doe of euery thing, be it neuer so common and knowne; it
hath a cloued or scaly roote, yellower and bigger then any of the red
Lillies: the stalke is of a blackish greene colour, and riseth as high
as most of the Lillies, hauing many faire, broad, and long greene
leaues thereon, larger and longer beneath, and smaller vpon the stalke
vpwards; the flowers are many or few, according to the age of the
plant, fertility of the soile, and time of standing where it groweth:
and stand vpon long greene footstalkes, of a faire white colour, with a
long pointell in the middle, and white chiues tipt with yellow pendents
about it; the smell is somewhat heady and strong.


_Lilium Album Byzantinum._   The White Lilly of Constantinople.

The other White Lilly, differeth but little from the former White
Lilly, either in roote, leafe, or flower, but only that this vsually
groweth with more number of flowers, then euer we saw in our ordinary
White Lilly: for I haue seene the stalke of this Lilly turne flat, of
the breadth of an hand, bearing neere two hundred flowers vpon a head,
yet most commonly it beareth not aboue a dozen, or twenty flowers, but
smaller then the ordinary, as the greene leaues are likewise.


        The Place.

        The first groweth onely in Gardens, and hath not beene declared
        where it is found wilde, by any that I can heare of. The other
        hath beene sent from Constantinople, among other rootes, and
        therefore is likely to grow in some parts neere thereunto.


        The Time.

        They flower in Iune or thereabouts, but shoote forth greene
        leaues in Autumne, which abide greene all the Winter, the
        stalke springing vp betweene the lower leaues in the Spring.


        The Names.

        It is called _Lilium Album_, the White Lilly, by most Writers;
        but by Poets _Rosa Iunonis_, Iuno’s Rose. The other hath his
        name in his title.


        The Vertues.

        This Lilly aboue all the rest, yea, and I thinke this onely,
        and none of the rest is vsed in medicines now adayes, although
        in former times Empericks vsed the red; and therefore I haue
        spoken nothing of them in the end of their Chapters, reseruing
        what is to be said in this. This hath a mollifying, digesting,
        and cleansing quality, helping to suppurate tumours, and
        to digest them, for which purpose the roote is much vsed.
        The water of the flowers distilled, is of excellent vertue
        for women in trauell of childe bearing, to procure an easie
        deliuery, as Matthiolus and Camerarius report. It is vsed also
        of diuers women outwardly, for their faces to cleanse the skin,
        and make it white and fresh. Diuers other properties there are
        in these Lillies, which my purpose is not to declare in this
        place. Nor is it the scope of this worke; this that hath been
        said is sufficient: for were it not, that I would giue you some
        taste of the qualities of plants (as I said in my Preface) as
        I goe along with them, a generall worke were fitter to declare
        them then this.




CHAP. VII.

_Fritillaria._   The checkerd Daffodill.


Although diuers learned men do by the name giuen vnto this delightfull
plant, thinke it doth in some things partake with a Tulipa or
Daffodill, and haue therefore placed it betweene them; yet I, finding
it most like vnto a little Lilly, both in roote, stalke, leafe, flower,
and seede, haue (as you see here) placed it next vnto the Lillies, and
before them. Hereof there are many sorts found out of late, as white,
red, blacke, and yellow, besides the purple, which was first knowne;
and of each of them there are also diuers sorts: and first of that
which is most frequent, and then of the rest, euery one in his place
and order.


1. _Fritillaria vulgaris._   The common checkerd Daffodill.

The ordinary checkerd Daffodill (as it is vsually called, but might
more properly be called the small checkerd Lilly) hath a small round
white roote, and somewhat flat, made as it were of two cloues, and
diuided in a maner into two parts, yet ioyning together at the bottome
or seate of the roote, which holdeth them both together: from betweene
this cleft or diuision, the budde for the stalke &c. appeareth, which
in time riseth vp a foote, or a foote and a halfe high, being round and
of a brownish greene colour, especially neere vnto the ground, whereon
there standeth dispersedly foure or fiue narrow long and greene leaues,
being a little hollow: at the toppe of the stalke, betweene the vpper
leaues (which are smaller then the lowest) the flower sheweth it selfe,
hanging or turning downe the head, but not turning vp againe any of his
leaues, as some of the Lillies before described doe; (sometimes this
stalke beareth two flowers, and very seldome three) consisting of sixe
leaues, of a reddish purple colour, spotted diuersly with great spots,
appearing like vnto square checkers, of a deeper colour; the inside
of the flower is of a brighter colour then the outside, which hath
some greennesse at the bottome of euery leafe: within the flower there
appeare sixe chiues tipt with yellow pendents, and a three-forked
stile or pointell compassing a greene head, which when the flower is
past, riseth vpright againe, and becommeth the seede vessell, being
somewhat long and round, yet hauing a small shew of edges, flat at the
head, like the head of a Lilly, and without any crowne as the Tulipa
hath, wherein is contained pale coloured flat seede, like vnto that of
a Lilly, but smaller.

[Sidenote: _Fritillaria vulgaris pallidior, praecox, & serotina._]

There is some variety to be seene in this flower; for in some the
colour is paler, and in others againe of a very high or deepe colour:
sometimes also they haue eight leaues, and sometimes ten or twelue, as
if two flowers were made one, which some thereupon haue called a Double
Fritillaria. Some of them likewise doe flower very early, euen with or
before the early flowring Tulipas; and some againe flower not vntill a
moneth or more after the former.

]


2. _Fritillaria flore atrorubente._   The bloud red Fritillaria.

The roote of this Fritillaria is somewhat rounder and closer then the
former, from whence the stalke riseth vp, being shorter and lower then
in any other of these kindes, hauing one or two leaues thereon, and
at the top thereof two or three more set closer together, which are
broader, shorter, and whiter then any of them before, almost like vnto
the leaues of the yellow Fritillaria, from among which toppe leaues
commeth forth the flower, somewhat bending downe, or rather standing
forth, being larger then any of the former, and almost equall in
bignesse vnto the yellow Fritillaria, of a duskie gray colour all ouer
on the outside, and of a very darke red colour on the inside, diuersly
spotted or straked: this very hardly encreaseth by the roote, and as
seldome giueth ripe seede, but flowreth with the other first sorts, and
before the blacke, and abideth lesse time in flower then any.


3. _Fritillaria maxima purpurea siue rubra._
The great purple or red Fritillaria.

This great Fritillaria hath his roote equall to the bignesse of the
rest of his parts, from whence riseth vp one, & oftentimes two stalks,
hauing one, two or three flowers a peece on them, as nature and the
seasons are fitting: euery one of these flowers are larger and greater
then any of the former described, and pendulous as they are, of a sad
red or purplish colour, with many thwart lines on them, and small
long markes, which hardly seeme checkerwise, nor are so eminent or
conspicuous as in the former: the stalke is strong and high, whereon
are set diuers long whitish greene leaues, larger and broader then
those of the former.


4. _Fritillaria alba._   The white Fritillaria.

The white Fritillaria is so like vnto the first, that I shall not neede
to make another description of this: it shall (I hope) be sufficient to
shew the chiefe differences, and so proceed to the rest. The stalke and
leaues of this are wholly greene, whereby it may easily be knowne from
the former, which, as is said, is brownish at the bottome. The flower
is white, without almost any shew of spot or marke in it, yet in some
the markes are somewhat more plainly to be seene, and in some againe
there is a shew of a faint kinde of blush colour to be seene in the
flower, especially in the inside, the bottomes of the leaues of euery
flower sometimes are greenish, hauing also a small list of greene,
comming downe towards the middle of each leafe: the head or seede
vessell, as also the seede and the roote, are so like vnto the former,
that the most cunning cannot distinguish them.


5. _Fritillaria flore duplici albicante._
The double blush Fritillaria.

This Fritillaria hath a round flattish white roote, very like vnto the
last Fritillaria, bearing a stalke with long greene leaues thereon,
little differing from it, or the first ordinary Fritillaria: the
flower is said to be constant, composed of many leaues, being ten at
the least, and most vsually twelue, of a pale whitish purple colour,
spotted like vnto the paler ordinary Fritillaria that is early, so that
one would verily thinke it were but an accidentall kinde thereof,
whereas it is (as is said before) held to bee constant, continuing in
this manner.


6. _Fritillaria flore luteo puro._   The pure yellow Fritillaria.

The pure yellow Fritillaria hath a more round, and not so flat a
whitish roote as the former kindes, and of a meane bignesse; from the
middle riseth vp a stalke a foote and a halfe high, and sometimes
higher, whereon are set without order diuers long and somewhat broad
leaues of a whitish greene colour, like vnto the leaues of the blacke
Fritillaria, but not aboue halfe so broad: the flower is somewhat small
and long, not much vnlike to the blacke for shape and fashion, but
that the leaues are smaller and rounder pointed, of a faint yellowish
colour, without any shew of spots or checkers at all, eyther within
or without the flower, hauing some chiues and yellow pendents in the
middle, as is to be seene in all of them: the seede is like the first
kinde.


7. _Fritillaria flore luteo vario siue punctato._
The checkerd yellow Fritillaria.

This Fritillaria groweth not much lower then the former, and brownish
at the rising vp, hauing his leaues whiter, broader, and shorter then
it, and almost round pointed. The flower is greater, and larger spread
then any other before, of a faire pale yellow colour, spotted in very
good order, with fine small checkers, which adde a wonderfull pleasing
beauty thereunto: it hath also some lists of greene running downe the
backe of euery leafe. It seldome giueth seede; the roote also is like
the other, but not so flat.


8. _Fritillaria lutea maxima Italica._
The great yellow Italian Fritillaria.

This kinde of Fritillaria riseth vp with a round and browne greene
stalke, whereon are set diuers leaues somewhat broad and short, which
compasse the stalke at the bottome of them, of a darke greene colour;
at the toppe of the stalke, which bendeth a little downewards, doe most
vsually stand three or foure leaues, betweene which commeth forth most
vsually but one flower, which is longer then the last, hanging downe
the head as all the others doe, consisting of sixe leaues, of a darke
yellowish purple colour, spotted with some small red checkers. This
kinde flowreth late, and not vntill all the rest are past.


9. _Fritillaria Italorum polyanthos flore parno._
The small Italian Fritillaria.

This small Italian Fritillaria carrieth more store of flowers on the
stalke, but they are much smaller, and of a yellowish greene colour,
spotted with long and small darke red checkers or markes: the stalke
hath diuers small short greene leaues thereon, vnto the very toppe.


10. _Fritillaria lutea Iuncifolia Lusitanica._
The small yellow Fritillaria of Portugall.

The leaues of this Fritillaria are so small, narrow and long, that it
hath caused them to take the name of rushes, as if you should call it,
The rush leafed Fritillaria, which stand on a long weake round stalke,
set without order the flower is small and yellow, but thicker checkerd
with red spots then any of the other yellow Fritillaria’s; the stalk of
the flower, at the head thereof, being also of a yellowish colour.


11. _Fritillaria Pyrenæa siue Apenninea._   The blacke Fritillaria.

The roote of this kinde doth often grow so great, that it seemeth like
vnto the roote of a small Crowne Imperiall: the stalke is strong,
round, and high, set without order, with broader and whiter greene
leaues then any of the former, bearing one, two, or three flowers;
sometimes at the toppe, being not so large as those of the ordinary
purple Fritillaria, but smaller, longer, and rounder, sometimes a
little turning vp the brims or edges of the leaues againe, and are of
a yellowish shining greene colour on the inside, sometimes spotted
with red spots almost through the whole inside of the flower, vnto the
very edge, which abideth of a pale yellow colour, and sometimes there
are very few spots to be seene, and those from the middle onely on
the inside (for on the outside there neuer appeareth any spots at all
in this kinde) and sometimes with no shew of spots at all, sometimes
also of a more pale greene, and sometime of a more yellow colour: the
outside of the flowers doe likewise vary, for in some the outside of
the leaues are of a darke sullen yellow, &c. else more pale yellow, and
in other of a darke purplish yellow colour, which in some is so deepe,
and so much, that it rather seemeth blacke then purple or yellow, and
this especially about the bottome of the flower, next vnto the stalke,
but the edges are still of a yellowish greene: the head of seede, and
the seede likewise is like vnto the former, but bigger in all respects.


12. _Fritillaria Hispanica vmbellifera._
The Spanish blacke Fritillaria.

This Fritillaria is no doubt of kindred to the last recited, it is
so like, but greater in all parts thereof, as if growing in a more
fruitfull soile, it were the stronger and lustier to beare more store
of flowers: the flowers grow foure or fiue from the head together,
hanging downe round about the stalke, like vnto a Crowne Imperiall, and
are of a yellowish greene colour on the inside, spotted with a few red
spots, the outside being blackish as the former.


        The Place.

        The first of these plants was first brought to our knowledge
        from France, where it groweth plentifully about Orleance;
        the other sorts grow in diuers other Countries, as some in
        Portugall, Spaine, Italy, &c. as their names doe import, and
        as in time they haue been obserued by those that were curious
        searchers of these rarities, haue been sent to vs.


        The Time.

        The early kindes doe flower in the beginning of Aprill or
        thereabouts, according to the mildenesse or sharpenesse of the
        precedent Winter. The other doe flower after the first are
        past, for a moneths space one after another, and the great
        yellow is very late, not flowring vntill about the middle or
        end of May.


        The Names.

        This hath receiued diuers names: some calling it _Flos
        Meleagridis_, the Ginny Hen Flower, of the variety of the
        colours in the flower, agreeing with the feathers of that
        Bird. Some call it _Narcissus Caparonius_, of the name of the
        first inuentor or finder thereof, called Noel Caperon, an
        Apothecary dwelling in Orleance, at the time he first found it,
        and was shortly after the finding thereof taken away in the
        Massacre in France. It is now generally called _Fritillaria_,
        of the word _Fritillus_, which diuers doe take for the Chesse
        borde or table whereon they play, whereunto, by reason of the
        resemblance of the great squares or spots so like it, they did
        presently referre it. It is called by Lobel _Lilionarcissus
        purpureus variegatus, & sessulatus_, making it a kinde of
        Tulipa; but as I said in the beginning of the Chapter, it
        doth most neerely resemble a small pendulous Lilly, and might
        therefore rightly hold the name of _Lilium variegatum_, or
        in English, the checkerd Lilly. But because the errour which
        first referred it to a Daffodill, is growne strong by custome
        of continuance, I leaue to euery one their owne will, to call
        it in English eyther Fritillaria, as it is called of most, or
        the checkerd Daffodill, or the Ginnie Hen flower, or, as I doe,
        the checkerd Lilly. I shall not neede in this place further to
        explaine the seuerall names of euery of them, hauing giuen you
        them in their titles.


        The Vertues.

        I haue not found or heard by any others of any property
        peculiar in this plant, to be applied either inwardly or
        outwardly for any disease: the chiefe or onely vse thereof
        is, to be an ornament for the Gardens of the curious louers
        of these delights, and to be worne of them abroad, which for
        the gallant beauty of many of them, deserueth their courteous
        entertainment, among many other the like pleasures.




CHAP. VIII.

_Tulipa._   The Turkes Cap.


Next vnto the Lillies, and before the Narcissi or Daffodils, the
discourse of Tulipas deserueth his place, for that it partaketh of both
their natures; agreeing with the Lillies in leaues, flowers, and seede,
and somewhat with the Daffodils in rootes. There are not onely diuers
kindes of Tulipas, but sundry diuersities of colours in them, found
out in these later dayes by many the searchers of natures varieties,
which haue not formerly been obserued: our age being more delighted in
the search, curiosity, and rarities of these pleasant delights, then
any age I thinke before. But indeede, this flower, aboue many other,
deserueth his true commendations and acceptance with all louers of
these beauties, both for the stately aspect, and for the admirable
varietie of colours, that daily doe arise in them, farre beyond all
other plants that grow, in so much, that I doubt, although I shall in
this Chapter set downe the varieties of a great many, I shall leaue
more vnspoken of, then I shall describe; for I may well say, there
is in this one plant no end of diuersity to be expected, euery yeare
yeelding a mixture and variety that hath not before been obserued, and
all this arising from the sowing of the seede. The chiefe diuision
of Tulipas, is into two sorts: _Præcoces_, early flowring Tulipas,
and _Serotinæ_, late flowring Tulipas. For that sort which is called
_Mediæ_ or _Dubiæ_, that is, which flower in the middle time betweene
them both, and may be thought to be a kinde or sort by it selfe, as
well as any of the other two: yet because they doe neerer participate
with the _Serotinæ_ then with the _Præcoces_, not onely in the colour
of the leafe, being of the same greennesse with the _Serotinæ_, and
most vsually also, for that it beareth his stalke and flower, high and
large like as the _Serotinæ_ doe; but especially, for that the seede
of a _Media Tulipa_ did neuer bring forth a _Præcox_ flower (although
I know Clusius, an industrious, learned, and painfull searcher and
publisher of these rarities, saith otherwise) so farre as euer I
could, by mine owne care or knowledge, in sowing their seede apart, or
the assurance of any others, the louers and sowers of Tulipa seede,
obserue, learne, or know: and because also that the seede of the
_Serotinæ_ bringeth forth _Medias_, and the seede of _Medias Serotinæ_,
they may well bee comprehended vnder the generall title of _Serotinæ_:
But because they haue generally receiued the name _Mediæ_, or middle
flowring Tulipas, to distinguish between them, and those that vsually
doe flower after them; I am content to set them downe, and speake of
them seuerally, as of three sorts. Vnto the place and ranke likewise
of the _Præcoces_, or early flowring Tulipas, there are some other
seuerall kinds of Tulipas to be added, which are notably differing, not
onely from the former _Præcox Tulipa_, but euery one of them, one from
another, in some speciall note or other: as the _Tulipa Boloniensis
flore rubro_, the red Bolonia Tulipa. _Tulipa Boloniensis flore luteo_,
the yellow Bolonia Tulipa. _Tulipa Persica_, Persian Tulipa. _Tulipa
Cretica_, the Candie Tulipa, and others: all which shall bee described
and entreated of, euery one apart by it selfe, in the end of the ranke
of the _Præcoces_, because all of them flower much about their time.
To begin then with the _Præcox_, or early flowring Tulipas, and after
them with the _Medias_ and _Serotinas_, I shall for the better method,
diuide their flowers into foure primary or principall colours, that is
to say, White, Purple, Red and Yellow, and vnder every one of these
colours, set downe the seuerall varieties of mixtures we haue seene
and obserued in them, that so they may be both the better described by
me, and the better conceiued by others, and euery one placed in their
proper ranke. Yet I shall in this, as I intend to doe in diuers other
plants that are variable, giue but one description in generall of the
plant, and then set downe the varietie of forme or colour afterwards
briefly by themselues.


_Tulipa præcox._   The early flowring Tulipa.

The early Tulipa (and so all other Tulipas) springeth out of the ground
with his leaues folded one within another, the first or lowest leafe
riseth vp first, sharpe pointed, and folded round together, vntill
it be an inch or two aboue the ground, which then openeth it selfe,
shewing another leafe folded also in the bosome or belly of the first,
which in time likewise opening it selfe, sheweth forth a third, and
sometimes a fourth and a fifth: the lower leaues are larger then the
vpper, and are faire, thicke, broad, long, and hollow like a gutter,
and sometimes crumpled on the edges, which will hold water that falleth
thereon a long time, of a pale or whitish greene colour, (and the
_Mediæ_ and _Serotinæ_ more greene) couered ouer as it were with a
mealinesse or hoarinesse, with an eye or shew of rednesse towards the
bottome of the leaues, and the edges in this kinde being more notable
white, which are two principall notes to know a _Præcox Tulipa_ from
a _Media_ or _Serotina_: the stalke with the flower riseth vp in the
middle, as it were through these leaues, which in time stand one aboue
another, compassing it at certaine vnequall distances, and is often
obserued to bend it selfe crookedly downe to the ground, as if it would
thrust his head thereinto, but turning vp his head (which will be
the flower) againe, afterwards standeth vpright, sometimes but three
or foure fingers or inches high, but more often halfe a foote, and a
foot high, but the _Medias_, and _Serotinas_ much higher, carrying
(for the most part) but one flower on the toppe thereof, like vnto a
Lilly for the forme, consisting of sixe leaues, greene at the first,
and afterwards changing into diuers and sundry seuerall colours and
varieties, the bottomes likewise of the leaues of these sometimes, but
most especially of the _Mediæ_, being as variable as the flower, which
are in some yellow, or green, or blacke, in others white, blew, purple,
or tawnie; and sometimes one colour circling another: some of them haue
little or no sent at all, and some haue a better then others. After
it hath been blowne open three or foure dayes or more, it will in the
heate of the Sunne spread it selfe open, and lay it selfe almost flat
to the stalke: in the middle of the flower standeth a greene long head
(which will be the seed vessell) compassed about with sixe chiues,
which doe much vary, in being sometimes of one, and sometimes of
another colour, tipt with pendents diuersly varied likewise: the head
in the middle of the flower groweth after the flower is fallen, to be
long, round, and edged, as it were three square, the edges meeting at
the toppe, where it is smallest, and making as it were a crowne (which
is not seen in the head of any Lilly) and when it is ripe, diuideth
it selfe on the inside into sixe rowes, of flat, thinne, brownish,
gristly seede, very like vnto the seede of the Lillies, but brighter,
stiffer, and more transparent: the roote being well growne is round,
and somewhat great, small and pointed at the toppe, and broader, yet
roundish at the bottome, with a certaine eminence or seate on the one
side, as the roote of the Colchicum hath; but not so long, or great, it
hath also an hollownesse on the one side (if it haue borne a flower)
where the stalke grew, (for although in the time of the first springing
vp, vntill it shew the budde for flower, the stalke with the leaues
thereon rise vp out of the middle of the roote; yet when the stalke is
risen vp, and sheweth the budde for flower, it commeth to one side,
making an impression therein) couered ouer with a brownish thin coate
or skin, like an Onion, hauing a little woollinesse at the bottome;
but white within, and firme, yet composed of many coates, one folding
within another, as the roote of the Daffodils be, of a reasonable
good taste, neyther very sweete, nor yet vnpleasant. This description
may well serue for the other Tulipas, being _Medias_ or _Serotinas_,
concerning their springing and bearing, which haue not any other great
variety therein worth the note, which is not expressed here; the chiefe
difference resting in the variety of the colours of the flower, and
their seuerall mixtures and markes, as I said before: sauing onely,
that the flowers of some are great and large, and of others smaller,
and the leaues of some long and pointed, and of others broad and
round, or bluntly pointed, as shall bee shewed in the end of the
Chapter: I shall therefore onely expresse the colours, with the mixture
or composure of them, and giue you withall the names of some of them,
(for it is impossible I thinke to any man, to giue seuerall names to
all varieties) as they are called by those that chiefly delight in them
with vs.

          The early red Tulipa.

          1 An ordinary red, with a yellow, & sometimes a blacke
          bottome.

          2 A deep red, with a small edge of yellow, called a Roane.

          3 A Baron, that is, a faire red with a small yellow edge.

          4 A Duke, a greater and a lesser, that is, a more or less
          faire deep red, with greater or lesser yellow edges, and a
          great yellow bottome. Some of this sort are much more or
          lesse faire then others, some also haue a blacke or darke
          greene bottome.

          5 A Dutchesse, that is like vnto the Duke, but more yellow
          then red, with greater yellow edges, and the red more or
          lesse circling the middle of the flower on the inside, with a
          large yellow bottome.

          6 A Testament Brancion, or a Brancion Duke, that is, a
          faire deepe red, or lesse red, with a pale yellow or butter
          coloured edge, some larger others smaller: and some more
          pleasing then others, in a very variable manner.

          7 A Flambant, differing from the Dutchesse; for this hath no
          such great yellow edge, but streaks of yellow through the
          leafe vnto the very edge.

          8 An Orenge colour, that is, a reddish yellow, or a red and
          yellow equally mixed, with small yellow edges, and sometimes
          without.

          9 A Vermillion, that is, a purplish red, streamed with
          yellow, the bottome yellow, and sometimes the edges.

          10 The Kings flower, that is, a crimson or bloud red,
          streamed with a gold yellow, differing from the Flambant, the
          bottome yellow, circled with red.

          11 A Fooles coate, parted with red and yellow guardes.

          The early yellow Tulipa.

          1 A faire gold yellow without mixture.

          2 A strawe colour.

          3 A faire yellow with reddish edges.

          4 A strawe colour, with red edges.

          5 A faire yellow, reddish on the out side onely.

          6 A gold or paler yellow, circled on the inside a little with
          red, very like the Dutchesse, but that it hath lesse red
          therein.

          7 A gold yellow with red toppes, and may be called, The early
          Fooles Cap.


_Tulipa de Caffa._   The Tulipa of Caffa.

There is another sort or kinde of early Tulipa, differing from the
former, whose pale greene leaues being as broad and large as they, and
sometimes crumpled or waued at the edges, in some haue the edges onely
of the said leaues for a good breadth, of a whitish or whitish yellow
colour, and in others, the leaues are lifted or parted with whitish
yellow and greene: the stalke riseth not vp so high as the former,
and beareth a flower at the toppe like vnto the former, in some of a
reddish yellow colour, with a russet coloured ground or bottome, and in
others, of other seuerall colours: the seede and roote is so like vnto
others of this kinde, that they cannot be distinguished.

There is (as I doe heare) of this kinde, both _Præcoces_ and _Serotinæ_
early flowring, and late flowring, whereof although wee haue not so
exact knowledge, as of the rest, yet I thought good to speake so much,
as I could hitherto vnderstand of them, and giue others leaue (if I doe
not) hereafter to amplifie it.


_Tulipa Boloniensis, siue Bombycina flore rubro major._
The greater red Bolonia Tulipa.

There are likewise other kindes of early Tulipas to bee spoken of,
and first of the red Bolonia Tulipa; the roote whereof is plainly
discerned, to be differing from all others: for that it is longer, and
not hauing so plaine an eminence at the bottome thereof, as the former
and later Tulipas, but more especially because the toppe is plentifully
stored with a yellowish silke-like woollinesse: the outside likewise or
skinne is of a brighter or paler red, not so easie to be pilled away,
and runneth vnder ground both downeright and sidewise (especially in
the countrey ground and ayre, where it will encrease aboundantly, but
not either in our London ayre, or forc’t grounds) somewhat like vnto
the yellow Bolonia Tulipa next following. It shooteth out of the ground
with broad and long leaues, like the former; but neither so broad, nor
of so white or mealy a greene colour as the former, but more darke then
the late flowring Tulipa, so that this may bee easily discerned by his
leafe from any other Tulipa aboue the ground, by one that is skilfull.
It beareth likewise three or foure leaues vpon the stalke, like the
former, and a flower also at the toppe of the same fashion, but that
the leaues hereof are alwayes long, and somewhat narrow, hauing a large
blacke bottome, made like vnto a cheuerne, the point whereof riseth vp
vnto the middle of the leafe, higher then any other Tulipa; the flower
is of a pale red colour, nothing so liuely as in the early or late red
Tulipas, yet sweeter for the most part then any of them, and neerest
vnto the yellow Bolonia Tulipa, which is much about the same sent.


_Tulipa pumilio rubra, siue Bergomensis rubra media & minor._
The dwarfe red Bergomo Tulipa, a bigger and a lesser.

There are two other sorts hereof, and because they were found about
Bergomo, do carry that name, the one bigger or lesser then another, yet
neither so great as the former, hauing very little other difference to
bee obserued in them, then that they are smaller in all parts of them.


_Tulipa Boloniensis flore luteo._   The yellow Bolonia Tulipa.

The roote of this Tulipa may likewise bee knowne from the former red
(or any other Tulipa) in that it seldome commeth to bee so bigge, and
is not so woolly at the toppe, and the skinne or outside is somewhat
paler, harder, and sharper pointed: but the bottome is like the former
red, and not so eminent as the early or late Tulipas. This beareth
much longer and narrower leaues then any (except the Persian & dwarfe
yellow Tulipas) and of a whitish greene colour: it beareth sometimes
but one flower on a stalke, and sometimes two or three wholly yellow,
but smaller, & more open then the other kinds, and (as I said) smelleth
sweete, the head for seede is smaller then in others, and hath not that
crowne at the head thereof yet the seed is like, but smaller.


_Tulipa Narbonensis, siue Monspeliensis vel pumilio._
The French or dwarfe yellow Tulipa.

This Tulipa is very like vnto the yellow Bolonia Tulipa, both in roote,
leafe, and flower, as also in the colour thereof, being yellow: the
onely difference is, that it is in all things lesser and lower, and is
not so apt to beare, nor so plentifull to encrease by the roote.


_Tulipa Italica maior & minor._
The Italian Tulipa the greater and the lesser.

Both these kindes of Tulipas doe so neere resemble the last kinde,
that I might almost say they were the same, but that some difference
which I saw in them, maketh mee set them apart; and consisteth in these
things, the stalkes of neither of both these rise so high, as of the
first yellow Bolonia Tulipa: the leaues of both sorts are writhed in
and out at the edges, or made like a waue of the sea, lying neerer the
ground, and the flower being yellow within, is brownish or reddish on
the backe, in the middle of the three outer leaues the edges appearing
yellow. Both these kindes doe differ one from the other in nothing, but
in that one is bigger, and the other smaller then the other which I saw
with Iohn Tradescante, my very good friend often remembred.


_Tulipa Lusitanica, siue pumilio versicolor._
The dwarfe stript Tulipa.

This dwarfe Tulipa is also of the same kindred with the three last
described; for there is no other difference in this from them, then
that the flower hath some red veins running in the leaues thereof.

There are two other sorts of dwarfe Tulipas with white flowers, whereof
Lobel hath made mention in the Appendix to his _Aduersaria_; the one
whereof is the same that Clusius setteth forth, vnder the title of
_Pumilio altera_: but because I haue not seen either of them both, I
speake no further of them.


_Tulipa pumilio alba._   The white dwarfe Tulipa.

But that white flower that Iohn Tradescante shewed me, and as hee
saith, was deliuered him for a white Pumilio, had a stalke longer then
they set out theirs to haue, and the flower also larger, but yet had
narrower leaues then other sorts of white Tulipas haue.


_Tulipa Bicolor._   The small party coloured Tulipa.

Vnto these kindes, I may well adde this kinde of Tulipa also, which was
sent out of Italy, whose leaues are small, long, and narrow, and of a
darke greene colour, somewhat like vnto the leaues of an Hyacinth: the
flower is small also, consisting of sixe leaues, as all other Tulipas
doe, three whereof are wholly of a red colour, and the other three
wholly of a yellow.

_Tulipa Persica._   The Persian Tulipa.

This rare Tulipa, wherewith we haue beene but lately acquainted, doth
most fitly deserue to be described in this place, because it doth so
neerely participate with the Bolonia and Italian Tulipas, in roote,
leafe, and flower: the roote hereof is small, couered with a thicke
hard blackish shell or skinne, with a yellowish woollinesse both at the
toppe, and vnder the shell. It riseth out of the ground at the first,
with one very long and small round leafe, which when it is three or
foure inches high, doth open it selfe, and shew forth another small
leafe (as long almost as the former) breaking out of the one side
thereat, and after it a third, and sometimes a fourth, and a fift;
but each shorter then other, which afterwards be of the breadth of
the dwarfe yellow Tulipa, or somewhat broader but much longer then
any other, and abiding more hollow, and of the colour of the early
Tulipas on the inside: the stalke riseth vp a foot and a halfe high
sometimes, bearing one flower thereon, composed of sixe long and
pointed leaues of the forme of other small Tulipas, and not shewing
much bigger then the yellow Italian Tulipa, and, is wholly white, both
inside and outside of all the leaues, except the three outtermost,
which haue on the backe of them, from the middle toward the edges, a
shew of a brownish blush or pale red colour, yet deeper in the midst,
and the edges remaining wholly white: the bottomes of all these leaues
are of a darke or dun tawnie colour, and the chiues and tippes of a
darkish purple or tawnie also. This doth beare seed but seldome in our
country, that euer I could vnderstand, but when it doth, it is small
like vnto the Bolonia or dwarfe yellow Tulipas, being not so plentifull
also in parting, or setting of by the roote as they, and neuer groweth
nor abideth so great as it is brought vnto vs, and seldome likewise
flowreth after the first yeare: for the rootes for the most part with
euery one grow lesse and lesse, decaying euery yeare, and so perish for
the most part by reason of the frosts and cold, and yet they haue been
set deepe to defend them, although of their owne nature they will runne
downe deep into the ground.


_Tulipa Byzantina duobus floribus Clusij._
The small Tulipa of Constantinople.

The small Tulipa of Constantinople, beareth for the most part but two
leaues on the stalke, which are faire and broad, almost like vnto the
Candy Tulipa, next hereunto to be described: the stalke it selfe riseth
not aboue a foote high, bearing sometimes but one flower, but most
commonly two thereon, one below another, and are no bigger then the
flowers of the yellow Bolonia Tulipa, but differing in colour; for this
is on the outside of a purplish colour, mixed with white and greene,
and on the inside of a faire blush colour, the bottome and chiues being
yellow, and the tippes or pendents blackish: the roote is very like the
yellow Bolonia Tulipa.


_Tulipa Cretica._   The Tulipa of Candie.

This Tulipa is of later knowledge with vs then the Persian, but doth
more hardly thriue, in regard of our cold climate; the description
whereof, for so much as wee haue knowledge, by the sight of the roote
and leafe, and relation from others of the flower, (for I haue not yet
heard that it hath very often flowred in our Country) is as followeth.
It beareth faire broad leaues, resembling the leaues of a Lilly, of a
greenish colour, and not very whitish: the stalke beareth thereon one
flower, larger and more open then many other, which is either wholly
white, or of a deepe red colour, or else is variably mixed, white with
a fine reddish purple, the bottomes being yellow, with purplish chiues
tipt with blackish pendents: the roote is small, and somewhat like the
dwarfe yellow Tulipa, but somewhat bigger.


_Tulipa Armeniaca._   The Tulipa of Armenia.

This small Tulipa is much differing from all the former (except the
small or dwarfe white Tulipas remembred by Lobel and Clusius, as is
before set downe) in that it beareth three or foure small, long, and
somewhat narrow greene leaues, altogether at one ioynt or place; the
stalke being not high, and naked or without leaues from them to the
toppe, where it beareth one small flower like vnto an ordinary red
Tulipa, but somewhat more yellow, tending to an Orenge colour with a
blacke bottome: the roote is not much bigger then the ordinary yellow
Bolonia Tulipa, before set downe.

And these are the sorts of this first _Classis_ of early Tulipas.


_Tulipa Media._   The meaner or middle flowring Tulipa.

For any other, or further description of this kinde of Tulipa, it shall
not neede, hauing giuen it sufficiently in the former early Tulipa, the
maine difference consisting first in the time of flowring, which is
about a moneth after the early Tulipas, yet some more some lesse; for
euen in the _Præcoces_, or early ones, some flower a little earlier,
and later then others, and then in the colours of the flowers; for wee
haue obserued many colours, and mixtures, or varieties of colours
in the _Medias_, which we could neuer see in the _Præcoces_, and so
also some in the _Præcoces_, which are not in the _Medias_: yet there
is farre greater varieties of mixture of colours in these _Medias_,
then hath been obserued in all the _Præcoces_, (although Clusius saith
otherwise) eyther by my selfe, or by any other that I haue conuersed
with about this matter, and all this hath happened by the sowing of the
seede, as I said before. I will therefore in this place not trouble
you with any further circumstance, then to distinguish them, as I haue
done in the former early Tulipas, into their foure primary colours, and
vnder them, giue you their seuerall varieties and names, for so much
as hath come to my knowledge, not doubting, but that many that haue
trauelled in the sowing of the seed of Tulipas many yeares, may obserue
each of them to haue some variety that others haue not: and therefore
I thinke no one man can come to the knowledge of all particular
distinctions.

          9 A pale or whitish yellow, which after a few dayes groweth
          more white, with purplish red edges, and some streakes
          running inward from the edge, which we call an Hackney.

          10 A white mixed with a bloud red very variably, and with a
          pure white, or other coloured bottome.

          11 A white, streamed with crimson flames, and spots through

          diuers sorts, with white, yellow, or blew bottomes, all which
          doe hold their markes constant, and doe not spread their

          foure dayes.

          13 A cloth of siluer of diuers sorts, that is, a white
          spotted, striped, or otherwise marked with red or purple, in

          part, with bloud red or purplish spots and lines vnto the
          very edges, which abide large and white. Of this kinde there
          are found very great varieties, not to be expressed.

          Of this sort there is so much variety, some being larger or
          fairer marked then others, their bottomes also varying, that
          it is almost impossible to express them.

          fallen, and therefore called, _Fucille mort_.

          10 A yellow shadowed with red, and striped also through all
          the leaues, the backside of them being of a red crimson, and
          the edges pale.

          11 A pale yellow, shadowed and striped with red, in some more
          in some lesse, the bottomes being either yellow or green.

          12 A _Testamentum Clusij_, that is, a shadowed pale yellow,
          both within & without, spotted round about the middle on the
          inside, as all other Holias are, the backe of the leaues
          being more obscure or shadowed with pale yellow edges, and a
          greene bottome.

          13 A yellow Flambant of diuers sorts, that is, the whole
          flower more or lesse streamed or spotted on the inside, and
          in some on the outside with red, the bottome in most being
          blacke, yet in some yellow.

          14 A paler yellow Flambant more beautifull.

          15 A yellow Holias, paler or deeper yellow very variable,
          spotted on the inside round about the middle, with red
          sometimes plentifully, or else sparingly with a green or dark
          tawny bottome.

          16 A strawe coloured Holias, spotted and streamed with red,
          as is to bee seene in the white Holias.

          17 A yellow Fooles coate, of some called a flame colour,
          wherein the yellow is more then the red, diuersly streamed.

          Vnto these may be added the greene Tulipa which is also of
          diuers sorts. One hauing a great flower of a deepe green
          colour, seldome opening it selfe, but abiding alwaies as it
          were halfe shut vp and closed, the chiues being as it were
          feathered. Another of a paler or yellowish green, paned with
          yellow, and is called, The Parret, &c. with white edges. A
          third of a more yellowish green, with red or purplish edges.
          A fourth, hath the leaues of the flower equally almost
          parted, with greene and a light purple colour, which abiding
          a long time in flower, groweth in time to be fairer marked:
          for at the first it doth not shew it selfe so plainely
          diuided. Some call this a greene Swisser. A fifth hath the
          longest leaues standing like a starre, consisting of greene
          and purple.


_Tulipa Serotina._   The late flowring Tulipa.

The late flowring Tulipa hath had his description expressed in the
precedent discourse, so that I shall not neede to make a repetition of
what hath already beene set downe. The greatest matter of knowledge in
this kinde is this, That it hath no such plentifull variety of colours
or mixtures in his flowers, as are in the two former sorts, but is
confined within these limits here expressed, as farre as hath come to
our knowledge.

          called the Suns eye.

          An ordinary yellow.

          A yellow with red edges.

          A yellow with red spots and veines, the bottome black or
          discoloured.

There yet remaine many obseruations, concerning these beautifull
flowers, fit to be knowne, which could not, without too much prolixity,
be comprehended within the body of the description of them; but are
reserued to bee intreated of a part by themselues.

All sorts of Tulipas beare vsually but one stalke, and that without
any branches: but sometimes nature is so plentifull in bearing, that
it hath two or three stalkes, and sometimes two, or more branches out
of one stalke (euery stalke or branch bearing one flower at the toppe)
but this is but seldome seene; and when it doth happen once, it is
hardly seene againe in the same roote, but is a great signe, that the
roote that doth thus, being an old roote, will the same yeare part into
diuers rootes, whereof euery one, being of a reasonable greatnesse,
will beare both his stalke and flower the next yeare, agreeing with the
mother plant in colour, as all the of-sets of Tulipas doe for the most
part: for although the young of-sets of some doe vary from the maine
roote, euen while it groweth with them, yet being separated, it will
bee of the same colour with the mother plant.

There groweth oftentimes in the _Medias_, and sometimes also in the
_Præcoces_, but more seldome, a small bulbe or roote, hard aboue the
ground, at the bottome of the stalke, and betweene it and the lower
leafe, which when the stalke is dry, and it ripe, being put into the
ground, will bring forth in time a flower like vnto the mother plant,
from whence it was taken.

The flowers also of Tulipas consist most commonly of sixe leaues, but
sometimes they are seene to haue eight or tenne, or more leaues; but
vsually, those rootes beare but their ordinary number of sixe leaues
the next yeare: the head for seede then, is for the most part foure
square, which at all other times is but three square, or when the
flower wanteth a leafe or two, as sometimes also it doth, it then is
flat, hauing but two sides.

The forme of the flower is also very variable; for the leaues of some
Tulipas are all sharpe pointed, or all blunt and round pointed, and
many haue the three outer leaues sharpe pointed, and the three inner
round or pointed, and some contrariwise, the three outermost round
pointed, and the three inner sharpe pointed. Againe, some haue all the
leaues of the flowers long and narrow, and some haue them broader and
shorter. Some _Præcoces_ also haue their flowers very large and great,
equall vnto eyther the _Media_, or _Serotina_, which most commonly are
the largest, and others haue them as small as the Bolonia Tulipa.

The bottomes of the leaues of the flowers are also variably
diuersified, and so are both the chiues or threeds that stand vp about
the head, and the tips or pendents that are hanging loose on the toppes
of them; and by the difference of the bottomes or chiues, many flowers
are distinguished, which else are very like in colour, and alike also
marked.

For the smell also there is some diuersity; for that the flowers of
some are very sweete, of others nothing at all, and some betweene both,
of a small sent, but not offensiue: and yet some I haue obserued haue
had a strong ill sent; but how to shew you to distinguish them, more
then by your owne sense, I cannot: for the seedes of sweete smelling
Tulipas doe not follow their mother plant, no more then they doe in the
colour.

And lastly, take this, which is not the least obseruation, worth the
noting, that I haue obserued in many: When they haue beene of one
entire colour for diuers yeares, yet in some yeare they haue altered
very much, as if it had not beene the same, viz. from a purple or
stamell, it hath beene variably either parted, or mixed, or striped
with white, eyther in part, or through the whole flower, and so in a
red or yellow flower, that it hath had eyther red or yellow edges, or
yellow or red spots, lines, veines, or flames, running through the red
or yellow colour, and sometimes it hath happened, that three leaues
haue been equally parted in the middle with red yellow, the other three
abiding of one colour, and in some the red had some yellow in it, and
the yellow some red spots in it also; whereof I haue obserued, that
all such flowers, not hauing their originall in that manner, (for some
that haue such or the like markes from the beginning, that is, from the
first and second yeares flowring, are constant, and doe not change) but
as I said, were of one colour at the first, doe shew the weaknesse and
decay of the roote, and that this extraordinary beauty in the flower,
is but as the brightnesse of a light, vpon the very extinguishing
thereof, and doth plainly declare, that it can doe his Master no more
seruice, and therefore with this iollity doth bid him good night.
I know there is a common opinion among many (and very confidently
maintained) that a Tulipa with a white flower, hath changed to beare
a red or yellow, and so of the red or yellow, and other colours, that
they are likewise inconstant, as though no flowers were certaine: but I
could neuer either see or heare for certaine any such alteration, nor
any other variation, but what is formerly expressed. Let not therefore
any iudicious be carried away with any such idle conceit, but rather
suspect some deceit in their Gardeners or others, by taking vp one, and
putting in another in the place, or else their owne mistaking.

Now for the sowing, planting, transplanting, choise, and ordering of
Tulipas, which is not the least of regard, concerning this subiect in
hand, but (as I think) would be willingly entertained; What I haue by
my best endeauours learned, by mine owne paines in almost forty yeares
trauell, or from others informations, I am willing here to set downe;
not doubting, but that some may adde what hath not come to my knowledge.

First, in the sowing of seedes of Tulipas, I haue not obserued
(whatsoeuer others haue written) nor could of certainty learne of
others, that there doth arise from the seedes of _Præcoces_ any
_Medias_ or _Serotine_ Tulipas, (or but very seldome) nor am certainly
assured of any: but that the seedes of all _Præcoces_ (so they be
not doubtfull, or of the last flowring sorts) will bring _Præcoces_:
And I am out of doubt, that I neuer saw, nor could learne, that euer
the seede of the _Medias_ or _Serotines_ haue giuen _Præcoces_; but
_Medias_ or _Serotines_, according to their naturall kinde. But if
there should bee any degeneration, I rather incline to thinke, that
it sooner commeth to passe (_à meliore ad pelus_, for _facilis est
descensus_, that is) that _Præcoces_ may giue _Medias_, then that
_Medias_ or _Serotines_ should giue _Præcoces_.

For the choise of your seede to sowe. First, for the _Præcoces_,
Clusius saith, that the _Præcox Tulipa_, that beareth a white flower,
is the best to giue the greatest variety of colours. Some among vs
haue reported, that they haue found great variety rise from the seede
of the red _Præcox_, which I can more hardly beleeue: but Clusius his
experience hath the greater probability, but especially if it haue
some mixture of red or purple in it. The purple I haue found to be the
best, next thereunto is the purple with white edges, and so likewise
the red with yellow edges, each of them will bring most of their owne
colours. Then the choise of the best _Medias_, is to take those colours
that are light, rather white then yellow, and purple then red; yea
white, not yellow, purple, not red: but these againe to be spotted is
the best, and the more the better; but withall, or aboue all in these,
respect the ground or bottome of the flower, (which in the _Præcox
Tulipa_ cannot, because you shall seldome see any other ground in them
but yellow) for if the flower be white, or whitish, spotted, or edged,
and straked, and the bottome blew or purple (such as is found in the
Holias, and in the Cloth of siluer), this is beyond all other the most
excellent, and out of question the choisest of an hundred, to haue the
greatest and most pleasant variety and rarity. And so in degree, the
meaner, in beauty you sowe, the lesser shall your pleasure in rarities
be. Bestowe not your time in sowing red or yellow Tulipa seede, or the
diuers mixtures of them; for they will (as I haue found by experience)
seldome be worth your paines. The _Serotina_, or late flowring Tulipa,
because it is seldome seene, with any especiall beautifull variety, you
may easily your selues ghesse that it can bring forth (euen as I haue
also learned) no raritie, and little or no diuersity at all.

The time and manner to sowe these seedes is next to be considered. You
may not sowe them in the spring of the yeare, if you hope to haue any
good of them; but in the Autumne, or presently after they be thorough
ripe and dry: yet if you sowe them not vntill the end of October,
they will come forward neuer the worse, but rather the better; for it
is often seene, that ouer early sowing causeth them to spring out of
the ground ouer early, so that if a sharp spring chance, to follow,
it may go neere to spoile all, or the most of your seede. Wee vsually
sowe the same yeares seede, yet if you chance to keepe of your owne,
or haue from others such seed, as is two years old, they will thriue
and doe well enough especially if they were ripe and well gathered:
You must not sowe them too thicke, for so doing hath lost many a pecke
of good seede, as I can tell; for if the seede lye one vpon another,
that it hath not roome vpon the sprouting, to enter and take roote in
the earth, it perisheth by and by. Some vse to tread downe the ground,
where they meane to sowe their seede, and hauing sowne them thereon,
doe couer them ouer the thicknesse of a mans thumbe with fine sifted
earth, and they thinke they doe well, and haue good reason for it: for
considering the nature of the young Tulipa rootes, is to runne downe
deeper into the ground, euery yeare more then other, they thinke to
hinder their quicke descent by the fastnesse of the ground, that so
they may encrease the better. This way may please some, but I doe not
vse it, nor can finde the reason sufficient; for they doe not consider,
that the stiffenesse of the earth, doth cause the rootes of the young
Tulipas to bee long before they grow great, in that a stiffe ground
doth more hinder the well thriuing of the rootes, then a loose doth,
and although the rootes doe runne downe deeper in a loose earth, yet
they may easily by transplanting be holpen, and raised vp high enough.
I haue also seene some Tulipas not once remoued from their sowing to
their flowring; but if you will not lose them, you must take them vp
while their leafe or stalk is fresh, and not withered: for if you doe
not follow the stalke downe to the roote, be it neuer so deepe, you
will leaue them behinde you. The ground also must be respected; for the
finer, softer, and richer the mould is, wherein you sowe your seede,
the greater shall be your encrease and varietie: Sift it therefore from
all stones and rubbish, and let it be either fat naturall ground of it
selfe, or being muckt, that it bee thoroughly rotten: but some I know,
to mend their ground, doe make such a mixture of grounds, that they
marre it in the making.

After the seede is thus sowne, the first yeares springing bringeth
forth leaues, little bigger then the ordinary grasse leaues; the second
yeare bigger, and so by degrees euery yeare bigger then other. The
leaues of the _Præcoces_ while they are young, may be discerned from
the _Medias_ by this note, which I haue obserued. The leaues of them
doe wholly stand vp aboue the ground, shewing the small footstalkes,
whereby euerie leafe doth stand, but the leaues of the _Medias_ or
_Serotines_ doe neuer wholly appeare out of the ground, but the lower
part which is broad, abideth vnder the vpper face of the earth. Those
Tulipas now growing to bee three yeares old, (yet some at the second,
if the ground and ayre be correspondent) are to bee taken vp out of
the ground, wherein yee shall finde they haue runne deepe, and to
be anew planted, after they haue been a little dryed and cleansed,
eyther in the same, or another ground againe, placing them reasonable
neare one vnto another, according to their greatnesse, which being
planted and couered ouer with earth againe, of about an inch or two
thicknesse, may be left vntaken vp againe for two yeare longer, if you
will, or else remoued euery yeare after, as you please; and thus by
transplanting them in their due season (which is still in the end of
Iuly, or beginning of August, or thereabouts) you shall according to
your seede and soyle, haue some come to bearing, in the fifth yeare
after the flowring, (and some haue had them in the fourth, but that
hath beene but few, and none of the best, or in a rich ground) some in
the sixth and seuenth, and some peraduenture, not vntill the eighth
or tenth yeare: but still remember, that as your rootes grow greater,
that in re-planting you giue them the more roome to be distant one from
another, or else the one will hinder, if not rot the other.

The seede of the _Præcoces_ doe not thriue and come forward so fast as
the _Medias_ or _Serotines_, nor doe giue any of-sets in their running
downe as the _Medias_ doe, which vsually leaue a small roote at the
head of the other that is runne downe euery yeare; and besides, are
more tender, and require more care and attendance then the _Medias_,
and therefore they are the more respected.

This is a generall and certaine rule in all Tulipas, that all the while
they beare but one leafe, they will not beare flower, whether they bee
seedlings, or the of-sets of elder rootes, or the rootes themselues,
that haue heretofore borne flowers; but when they shew a second leafe,
breaking out of the first, it is a certaine signe, that it will then
beare a flower, vnlesse some casualty hinder it, as frost or raine, to
nip or spoile the bud, or other vntimely accident befall it.

To set or plant your best and bearing Tulipas somewhat deeper then
other rootes, I hold it the best way; for if the ground bee either
cold, or lye too open to the cold Northerne ayre, they will be
the better defended therein, and not suffer the frosts or cold to
pierce them so soone: for the deepe frosts and snowes doe pinch the
_Præcoces_ chiefly, if they bee too neare the vppermost crust of
the earth; and therefore many, with good successe, couer ouer their
ground before Winter, with either fresh or old rotten dung, and that
will maruellously preserue them. The like course you may hold with
seedlings, to cause them to come on the forwarder, so it bee after the
first yeares sowing, and not till then.

To remoue Tulipas after they haue shot forth their fibres or small
strings, which grow vnder the great round rootes, (that is, from
September vntill they bee in flower) is very dangerous; for by remouing
them when they haue taken fast hold in the ground, you doe both hinder
them in the bearing out their flower, and besides, put them in hazzard
to perish, at least to bee put backe from bearing for a while after,
as oftentimes I haue proued by experience: But when they are now risen
to flower, and so for any time after, you may safely take them vp if
you will, and remoue them without danger, if you haue any good regard
vnto them, vnlesse it be a young bearing roote, which you shall in so
doing much hinder, because it is yet tender, by reason it now beareth
his first flower. But all Tulipa roots when their stalke and leaues are
dry, may most safely then be taken vp out of the ground, and be so kept
(so that they lye in a dry, and not in a moist place) for sixe moneths
without any great harme: yea I haue knowne them that haue had them nine
moneths out of the ground, and haue done reasonable well, but this
you must vnderstand withall, that they haue not been young but elder
rootes, and they haue been orderly taken vp and preserued. The dryer
you keep a Tulipa roote the better, so as you let it not lye in the
sunne or winde, which will pierce it and spoile it.

Thus Gentlewomen for your delights, (for these pleasures are the
delights of leasure, which hath bred your loue & liking to them, and
although you are herein predominant, yet cannot they be barred from
your beloued, who I doubt not, wil share with you in the delight as
much as is fit) haue I taken this paines, to set downe, and bring to
your knowledge such rules of art, as my small skill hath enabled mee
withall concerning this subiect, which of all other, seemed fittest
in this manner to be enlarged, both for the varietie of matter, and
excellency of beautie herein, and also that these rules set forth
together in one place, might saue many repetitions in other places, so
that for the planting and ordering of all other bulbous rootes, and
the sowing the seedes of them, you may haue recourse vnto these rules,
(_tanquam ad normam & examen_) which may serue in generall for all
other, little diuersitie of particulars needing exception.


        The Place.

        The greater Tulipas haue first beene sent vs from
        Constantinople, and other parts of Turkie, where it is said
        they grow naturally wilde in the Fields, Woods, and Mountaines;
        as Thracia, Macedonia, Pontus about the Euxine Sea, Cappadocia,
        Bithynia, and about Tripolis and Aleppo in Syria also: the
        lesser haue come from other seuerall places, as their names doe
        decipher it out vnto vs; as Armenia, Persia, Candye, Portugall,
        Spaine, Italy, and France. They are all now made denizens
        in our Gardens, where they yeeld vs more delight, and more
        encrease for their proportion, by reason of the culture, then
        they did vnto their owne naturals.


        The Time.

        These doe flower some earlier, some later, for three whole
        moneths together at the least, therein adorning out a Garden
        most gloriously, in that being but one kinde of flower, it is
        so full of variety, as no other (except the Daffodils, which
        yet are not comparable, in that they yield not that alluring
        pleasant variety) doe the like besides. Some of the _Præcoces_
        haue beene in flower with vs, (for I speake not of their owne
        naturall places, where the Winters are milder, and the Spring,
        earlier then ours) in the moneth of Ianuary, when the Winter
        before hath beene milde, but many in February, and all the
        _Præcoces_, from the beginning to the end of March, if the
        yeare be kindly: at what time the _Medias_ doe begin, and abide
        all Aprill, and part of May, when the _Serotines_ flower and
        fade; but this, as I said, if the yeare be kindly, or else each
        kinde will be a moneth later. The seede is ripe in Iune and
        Iuly, according to their early or late flowring.


        The Names.

        There haue beene diuers opinions among our moderne Writers, by
        what name this plant was knowne to the ancient Authors. Some
        would haue it be _Cosmosandatos_, of the Ancient. Dodonæus
        referreth it to πυπῶν of Theophrastus, in his seuenth Booke
        and thirteenth Chapter: but thereof he is so briefe, that
        besides the bare name, wee cannot finde him to make any further
        relation of forme, or quality. And Bauhinus, vpon Matthiolus
        Commentaries of Dioscorides, and in his Pinax also, followeth
        his opinion. Camerarius in his Hortus Medicus is of opinion,
        it may be referred to the Helychrysum of Crateua. Gesner, as I
        thinke, first of all, and after him Lobel, Camerarius, Clusius
        and many others, referre it to the Satyrium of Dioscorides:
        and surely this opinion is the most probable for many reasons.
        First, for that this plant doth grow very frequent in many
        places of Greece, and the lesser Asia, which were no doubt
        sufficiently knowne both to Theophrastus, and Dioscorides,
        and was accounted among bulbous rootes, although by sundry
        names. And secondly, as Dioscorides setteth forth his Satyrium,
        so this most commonly beareth three leaues vpon a stalke
        (although sometimes with vs it hath foure or fiue) like vnto
        a Lilly, whereof some are often seen to be both red, in the
        first springing, and also vpon the decaying, especially in a
        dry time, and in a dry ground: the flower likewise of some
        is white, and like a Lilly; the roote is round, and as white
        within as the white of an egge, couered with a browne coate,
        hauing a sweetish, but not vnpleasant taste, as any man without
        danger many try. This description doth so liuely set forth
        this plant, that I thinke wee shall not neede to be any longer
        in doubt, where to finde Dioscorides his Satyrium Triphyllum,
        seeing wee haue such plenty growing with vs. And thirdly, there
        is no doubt, but that it hath the same qualities, as you shall
        hereafter heare further. And lastly, that plant likewise that
        beareth a red flower, may very well agree with his Erythronium;
        for the descriptions in Dioscorides are both alike, as are
        their qualities, the greatest doubt may be in the seede, which
        yet may agree vnto Lin or Flaxe as fitly, or rather more then
        many other plants doe, in many of his comparisons, which yet
        wee receiue for currant. For the seede of Tulipas are flat,
        hard, and shining as the seede of _Linum_ or Flaxe, although
        of another colour, and bigger, as Dioscorides himselfe setteth
        it downe. But if there should be a mistaking in the writing
        of λὶνου for κρὶνου or λεῖριου in the Greeke Text, as the
        slippe is both easie and likely, it were then out of all
        question the same: for the seede is very like vnto the seede
        of Lillies, as any man may easily discerne that know them,
        or will compare them. It is generally called by all the late
        Writers, _Tulipa_, which is deriued from the name _Tulpan_,
        whereby the Turkes of _Dalmatia_ doe entitle their head
        Tyres, or Caps; and this flower being blowne, laide open, and
        inuerted, doth very well resemble them. We haue receiued the
        early kinde from Constantinople, by the name of _Cafa lale_,
        and the other by the name of _Cauala lale_. Lobel and others
        doe call it _Lilio-narcissus_, because it doth resemble a Lilly
        in the leafe, flower, and seede, and a Daffodil in the roote.
        We call it in English the Turkes Cap, but most vsually Tulipa,
        as most other Christian Countries that delight therein doe.
        Daleschampius calleth it Oulada.


        The Vertues.

        Dioscorides writeth, that his first Satyrium is profitable for
        them that haue a convulsion in their necke, (which wee call a
        cricke in the necke) if it be drunke in harsh (which we call
        red) wine.

        That the roots of Tulipas are nourishing, there is no doubt,
        the pleasant, or at least the no vnpleasant taste, may hereunto
        perswade; for diuers haue had them sent by their friends from
        beyond Sea, and mistaking them to bee Onions, haue vsed them as
        Onions in their pottage or broth, and neuer found any cause of
        mislike, or any sense of euill quality produced by them, but
        accounted them sweete Onions.

        Further, I haue made tryall of them my selfe in this manner. I
        haue preserued the rootes of these Tulipas in Sugar, as I haue
        done the rootes of Eringus, Orchis, or any other such like, and
        haue found them to be almost as pleasant as the Eringus rootes,
        being firme and sound, fit to be presented to the curious; but
        for force of Venereous quality, I cannot say, either from my
        selfe, not hauing eaten many, or from any other, on whom I haue
        bestowed them: but surely, if there be any speciall propertie
        in the rootes of Orchis, or some other tending to that purpose,
        I thinke this may as well haue it as they. It should seeme,
        that Dioscorides doth attribute a great Venereous faculty to
        the seede, whereof I know not any hath made any especiall
        experiment with vs as yet.




CHAP. IX.

_Narcissus._   The Daffodill.


There hath beene great confusion among many of our moderne Writers of
plants, in not distinguishing the manifold varieties of Daffodils;
for euery one almost, without consideration of kinde or forme, or
other speciall note, giueth names so diuersly one from another, that
if any one shall receiue from seuerall places the Catalogues of their
names (as I haue had many) as they set them down, and compare the
one Catalogue with the other, he shall scarce haue three names in a
dozen to agree together, one calling that by one name, which another
calleth by another, that very few can tell what they meane. And this
their confusion, in not distinguishing the name of _Narcissus_ from
_Pseudonarcissus_, is of all other in this kinde the greatest and
grossest errour. To auoide therefore that gulfe, whereof I complaine
that so manie haue bin endrenched; and to reduce the Daffodils into
such a methodicall order, that euery one may know, to what _Classis_
or forme any one doth appertaine, I will first diuide them into
two principall or primary kindes: that is, into _Narcissos_, true
Daffodils, and _Pseudonarcissos_, bastard Daffodils: which distinction
I hold to be most necessarie to be set downe first of all, that euery
one may be named without confusion vnder his owne primary kind, and
then to let the other parts of the subdiuision follow, as is proper
to them, and fittest to expresse them. Now to cause you to vnderstand
the difference betweene a true Daffodill and a false, is this; it
consisteth onely in the flower, (when as in all other parts they cannot
bee distinguished) and chiefly in the middle cup or chalice; for that
we doe in a manner onely account those to bee _Pseudonarcissos_,
bastard Daffodils, whose middle cup is altogether as long, and sometime
a little longer then the outter leaues that doe encompasse it, so
that it seemeth rather like a trunke or long nose, then a cup or
chalice, such as almost all the _Narcissi_, or true Daffodils haue; I
say almost, because I know that some of them haue their middle cup so
small, that we rather call it a crowne then a cup; and againe, some of
them haue them so long, that they may seem to be of the number of the
_Pseudonyms_, or bastard Daffodils: but yet may easily be knowne from
them, in that, although the cup of some of the true Daffodils be great,
yet it is wider open at the brim of edge, and not so long and narrow
all alike as the bastard kindes are; and this is the chiefe and onely
way to know how to seuer these kindes, which rule holdeth certaine in
all, except that kinde which is called _Narcissus Iuncifolius reflexo
flore_, whose cup is narrow, and as long as the leaues that turne vp
againe.

Secondly, I will subdiuide each of these again apart by themselues,
into foure sorts; and first the _Narcissos_, or true Daffodils into

_Latifolios_, broad leafed Daffodils.

_Angustifolios_, narrow leafed Daffodils.

_Iuncifolios_, Rushe Daffodils, and

_Marinos_, Sea Daffodils.

These sorts againe doe comprehend vnder them some other diuisions,
whereby they may the better be distinguished, and yet still bee
referred to one of those foure former sorts: as

_Monanthos_, that is, Daffodils that beare but one flower, or two at
the most vpon a stalke, and

_Polyanthos_, those that beare many flowers together vpon a stalke: as
also

_Simplici flore_, those that beare single flowers, and

_Multiplici flore_, or _flore pleno_, that is, haue double flowers.

_Vernales_, those that flower in the Spring, and among them some that
are earlier; and therefore called

_Præcoces_, early flowring Daffodils, and

_Autumnales_, those that flower in Autumne onely.

And lastly, with the _Pseudonarcissos_, or bastard Daffodils, I will
keepe the same order, to distinguish them likewise into their foure
seuerall sorts; and as with the true Daffodils, so with these false,
describe vnder euery sort: first, those that beare single flowers,
whether one or many vpon a stalke; and then those that beare double
flowers, one or many also. As for the distinctions of _maior_ and
_minor_, greater and lesser, and of _maximus_ and _minimus_, greatest
and least, they doe not onely belong to these Daffodils; and therefore
must be vsed as occasion permitteth, but vnto all other sort of plants.
To begin therefore, I thinke fittest with that stately Daffodill, which
for his excellency carrieth the name of None such.


1. _Narcissus latifolius omnium maximus, amplo calice flauo, siue
Nompareille._
The great None such Daffodill, or Incomparable Daffodill.

This _Narcissus Nompareille_ hath three or foure long and broad leaues,
of a grayish greene colour, among which riseth vp a stalke two foote
high at the least, at the toppe whereof, out of a thinne skinnie huske,
as all Daffodils haue, commeth forth one large single flower, and no
more vsually, consisting of sixe very pale yellow large leaues, almost
round at the point, with a large cuppe in the middle, somewhat yellower
then the leaues, the bottome whereof next vnto the stalke is narrow and
round, rising wider to the mouth, which is very large and open, and
vneuenly cut in or indented about the edges. The cup doth very well
resemble the chalice, that in former dayes with vs, and beyond the Seas
is still vsed to hold the Sacramentall Wine, that is with a narrower
bottome, and a wide mouth. After the flower is past, sometimes there
commeth (for it doth not often) a round greene head, and blacke round
seede therein, like vnto other Daffodils, but greater. The roote is
great, as other Daffodils that beare large flowers, and is couered ouer
with a brownish coate or skinne. The flower hath little or no sent at
all.

[Sidenote: _Flore geminato._]

This doth sometimes bring forth a flower with ten or twelue leaues, and
a cup much larger, as if it would be two, euen as the flower seemeth.


2. _Narcissus omnium maximus flore & calice flauo._
The great yellow Incomparable Daffodill.

This other kinde differeth neither in forme, nor bignesse of leafe or
flower from the former, but in the colour of the circling leaues of the
flower, which are of the same yellow colour with the cup.

[Sidenote: _Flore geminato._]

This doth sometimes degenerate and grow luxurious also, bringing forth
two flowers vpon a stalke, each distinct from other, and sometimes
two flowers thrust together, as if they were but one, although it be
but seldome; for it is not a peculiar kinde that is constant, yearly
abiding in the same forme.


3. _Narcissus maximus griseus calice flauo._
The gray Peerlesse Daffodill.

This Peerlesse Daffodill well deserueth his place among these kindes,
for that it doth much resemble them, and peraduenture is but a
difference raised from the seede of the former, it is so like in leafe
and flower, but that the leaues seeme to be somewhat greater, and the
sixe outer leaues of the flower to be of a glistering whitish gray
colour, and the cup yellow, as the former, but larger.


4. _Narcissus latifolius flauo flore amplo calice, siue Mattenesse._
The lesser yellow Nompareille, or the Lady Mattenesses Daffodill.

The leaues of this Daffodill, are somewhat like vnto the leaues of the
first kind, but not altogether so long or broad: the stalke likewise
riseth not vp fully so high, and beareth one flower like the former,
but lesser, and both the cuppe and the leaues are of one colour, that
is, of a pale yellow, yet more yellow then in the former: the cup of
this also is lesser, and a little differing; for it is neither fully
so small in the bottome, nor so large at the edges, nor so crumpled at
the brimmes, so that all these differences doe plainly shew it to be
another kinde, quite from the former.


        The Place.

        The places of none of these are certainly knowne to vs where
        they grow naturally, but we haue them onely in our Gardens, and
        haue beene sent, and procured from diuers places.


        The Time.

        They flower sometimes in the end of March, but chiefly in
        Aprill.


        The Names.

        The first and second haue been sent vs by the name of _Narcisse
        Nompareille_, as it is called in French; and in Latine,
        _Narcissus omnium maximus amplo calice flauo_, and _Narcissus
        Incomparabilis_, that is, the Incomparable Daffodill, or the
        greatest Daffodill of all other, with a large yellow cuppe:
        but assuredly, although this Daffodill doth exceed many other,
        both in length and bignesse, yet the great Spanish bastard
        Daffodill, which shall be spoken of hereafter, is in my
        perswasion oftentimes a farre higher and larger flower; and
        therefore this name was giuen but relatiuely, we may call it
        in English, The great None such Daffodill, or the Incomparable
        Daffodill, or the great Peerlesse Daffodill, or the Nompareille
        Daffodill, which you will: for they all doe answer either the
        French or the Latine name; and because this name _Nompareille_
        is growne currant by custome, I know not well how to alter it.
        The third kinde may passe with the title giuen it, without
        controule. The last is very well knowne beyond the Seas,
        especially in the Low Countries, and those parts, by the Lady
        Mattenesse Daffodill, because Clusius receiued it from her. We
        may call it in English, for the correspondency with the former,
        The lesser yellow Nompareille, or Peerlesse Daffodill, or the
        Lady Mattenesse Daffodill, which you will.


_Narcissus Indicus flore rubro, dictus Iacobæus._
The Indian Daffodill with a red flower.

This Indian Daffodill is so differing, both in forme, not hauing a
cuppe, and in colour being red, from the whole Family of the Daffodils
(except the next that followeth, and the Autumne Daffodils) that some
might justly question the fitnesse of his place here. But because as
all the plants, whether bulbous or other, that come from the Indies,
either East or West (although they differ very notably, from those that
grow in these parts of the world) must in a generall suruey and muster
be ranked euery one, as neere as the surueiours wit will direct him,
vnder some other growing with vs, that is of neerest likenesse; Euen so
vntill some other can direct his place more fitly, I shall require you
to accept of him in this, with this description that followeth, which
I must tell you also, is more by relation then knowledge, or sight of
the plant it selfe. This Daffodill hath diuers broad leaues, somewhat
like vnto the common or ordinary white Daffodill, of a grayish greene
colour; from the sides whereof, as also from the middle of them, rise
vp sometimes two stalkes together, but most vsually one after another
(for very often it flowreth twice in a Summer) and often also but one
stalke alone, which is of a faint reddish colour, about a foote high or
more, at the toppe whereof, out of a deepe red skinne or huske, commeth
forth one flower bending downwards, consisting of sixe long leaues
without any cup in the middle, of an excellent red colour, tending to a
crimson; three of these leaues that turne vpwards, are somewhat larger
then those three that hang downewards, hauing sixe threads or chiues in
the middle, tipt with yellow pendents, and a three forked stile longer
then the rest, and turning vp the end thereof againe: the roote is
round and bigge, of a brownish colour on the outside, and white within.
This is set forth by Aldinus, Cardinall Farnesius his Physitian, that
at Rome it rose vp with stalks of flowers before any leaues appeared.


        The Place, Time, and Names.

        This naturally groweth in the West Indies, from whence it was
        brought into Spaine, where it bore both in Iune and Iuly, and
        by the Indians in their tongue named AZCAL XOCHITL, and hath
        beene sent from Spaine, vnto diuers louers of plants, into
        seuerall parts of Christendome, but haue not thriued long in
        these transalpine colde Countries, so far as I can heare.


_Narcissus Trapezunticus flore luteo præcocissimus._
The early Daffodill of Trebizond.

Because this Daffodill is so like in flower vnto the former, although
differing in colour, I thought it the fittest place to ioyne it the
next thereunto. This early Daffodill hath three or foure short very
greene leaues, so like vnto the leaues of the Autumne Daffodill,
that many may easily bee deceiued in mistaking one for another, the
difference consisting chiefly in this, that the leaues of this are not
so broad or so long, nor rise vp in Autumne: in the midst of these
leaues riseth vp a short green stalke, an handfull high, or not much
higher vsually, (I speake of it as it hath often flowred with mee,
whether the cause be the coldnesse of the time wherein it flowreth, or
the nature of the plant, or of our climate, I am in some doubt; but I
doe well remember, that the stalkes of some plants, that haue flowred
later with me then the first, haue by the greater strength, and comfort
of the Sunne, risen a good deale higher then the first) bearing at the
top, out of a whitish thinne skinne stripped with greene, one flower a
little bending downewards, consisting of sixe leaues, laid open almost
in the same manner with the former Indian Daffodill, whereof some doe
a little turne vp their points againe, of a faire pale yellow colour,
hauing sixe white chiues within it, tipt with yellow pendents, and
a longer pointell: the roote is not very great, but blackish on the
outside, so like vnto the Autumne Daffodill, but that it is yellow
vnder the first or outermost coate, that one may easily mistake one for
another.


        The Place.

        It was sent vs from Constantinople among other rootes, but
        as wee may ghesse by the name, it should come thither from
        Trapezunte or Trebizond.


        The Time.

        It flowreth sometimes in December, if the former part of the
        Winter haue been milde; but most vsually about the end of
        Ianuary, or else in Februarie the beginning or the end.


        The Names.

        Wee doe vsually call it from the Turkish name, _Narcissus
        Trapezunticus_, and some also call it _Narcissus vernus
        præcox_, as Clusius doth, in English, The early Daffodill of
        Trebizond.

_Narcissus Montanus albus apophysibus præditus._
The white Mountaine Daffodill with eares, or The white winged Daffodill.


This Mountaine Daffodill riseth vp with three or four broad leaues,
somewhat long, of a whitish greene colour, among which riseth vp a
stalke a foote and a halfe high, whereon standeth one large flower,
and sometimes two, consisting of sixe white leaues a peece, not very
broad, and without any shew of yellownesse in them, three whereof haue
vsually each of them on the back part, at the bottome vpon the one side
of them, and not on both, a little small white peece of a leafe like an
eare, the other three hauing none at all: the cup is almost as large,
or not much lesse then the small Nompareille, small at the bottome, and
very large, open at the brimme, of a faire yellow colour, and sometimes
the edges or brimmes of the cup will haue a deeper yellow colour about
it, like as if it were discoloured with Saffron: the flower is verie
sweete, the roote is great and white, couered with a pale coate or
skinne, not verie blacke, and is not very apt to encrease, seldome
giuing of-sets; neither haue I euer gathered seede thereof, because it
passeth away without bearing any with me.


_Narcissus Montanus, siue Nompareille totus albus amplo calice._
The white Nompareille Daffodill.

This white Nompareille Daffodill, is in roote and leafe very like vnto
the former mountain or winged Daffodill, but that they are a little
larger: the stalke from among the leaues riseth vp not much higher then
it, bearing at the top one large flower, composed of sixe long white
leaues, each whereof is as it were folded halfe way together, in the
middle whereof standeth forth a large white cup, broader at the mouth
or brims then at the bottome, very like vnto the lesser Nompareille
Daffodill before remembred, which hath caused it to be so entituled:
the sent whereof is no lesse sweete then the former.


        The Place.

        The naturall places of these Daffodils are not certainly knowne
        to vs; but by the names they carry, they should seeme to bee
        bred in the Mountaines.


        The Time.

        These flower not so early as many other kindes doe, but rather
        are to bee accounted among the late flowring Daffodils; for
        they shew not their flowers vntill the beginning of May, or the
        latter end of Aprill, with the soonest.


        The Names.

        The names set downe ouer the heads of either of them be such,
        whereby they are knowne to vs; yet some doe call the first
        _Narcissus auriculatus_, that is to say, The Daffodill with
        eares: and the other, _Narcissus Nompareille totus albus_, that
        is to say, The white Nompareille, or Peerlesse Daffodill.


1. _Narcissus albus oblongo calice luteo præcox minor._
The small early white Daffodill with a long cup.

The leaues of this early Daffodill are broad, very greene, and not
whitish as others, three or foure standing together, about a foote
long or better, among which riseth vp a greene stalke, not full so
high as the leaues, bearing one flower at the toppe thereof of a
reasonable bignesse, but not so great as the later kindes that follow
are, consisting of six whitish leaues, but not perfect white, hauing
a show of a Creame colour appearing in them; in the middle is a long
round yellow cup, about halfe an inch long or better. The smell of this
flower is reasonable sweete, the roote is of a reasonable bignesse, yet
lesser then the rootes of the later kindes.


2. _Narcissus pallidus oblongo calice flauo præcox._
The early Strawe coloured Daffodill with a long cup.

The leaues of this Daffodill are as greene as the former, but much
narrower; and the leaues of the flower are more enclining to yellow,
but yet very pale, as if it were a light strawe colour, and seeme to
bee a little more narrow and pointed then the former: the cup of this,
is as long and yellow as the precedent. The smell whereof is very like
the former, yet neither of them being so sweete as those that follow.


3. _Narcissus albus oblongo calice luteo serotinus maier._
The great late flowring white Daffodill with a long cup.

This later flowring Daffodill hath his leaues somewhat narrow & long,
of a grayish or whitish greene colour, among which the stalke riseth
vp a foote and a halfe high, bearing one flower at the toppe, made of
six white leaues, hauing the cup in the middle thereof as long as the
former, and of a deepe yellow: the edges of this cuppe are sometimes
plaine, and sometimes a little crumpled; they are often also circled at
the brimmes with a Saffron colour, and often also without it, the smell
whereof is very pleasant, and not heady: the roote hereof is reasonable
bigge, and couered ouer rather with a pale then blackish skinne. This
flower doth sometimes alter his forme into eight leaues, which being
narrow and long, seeme like a white starre, compassing a yellow trunke.


4. _Narcissus totus pallidus oblongo calice serotinus minor._
The late pale coloured Daffodill with a long cup.

There is another of this kinde, whose flowers is wholly of a pale
white, or yellowish colour, differing neither in leafe nor roote from
the former.


5. _Narcissus pallidus oblongo calice flauo serotinus._
The Strawe coloured late flowring Daffodill with a long yellow cup.

The chiefe difference of this Daffodill from the former, consisteth
in the colour of the cup, which is a more yellow colour, and a little
larger then the former, and the brimmes or edges of the cup of a deeper
yellow, or Saffron colour. The smell of this is no lesse sweete then in
the former.


6. _Narcissus albus oblongo calice flauo serotinus, duobus floribus in
caule._
The late white Daffodill with a long cup, and two flowers on a stalke.

This Daffodill is surely a kinde of it selfe, although it be so like
the former, abiding constant in his forme and manner of flowring,
vsually bearing without missing two flowers vpon a stalke, very like
vnto the former great white kinde, that one cannot know any greater
matter of difference betweene them, then that it beareth two flowers
on a stalke: the cuppes whereof are seldome touched with any shew of
Saffron colour on them at the brimmes or edges, as some of the former
haue.


        The Place.

        All these Daffodils doe grow on the Pyrenæan mountaines, and
        haue been sought out, and brought into these parts, by those
        curious or couetous searchers of these delights, that haue made
        vs partakers of them.


        The Time.

        The former kindes flower earlier by a fortnight then the later,
        the one in the later end of March, and the other not vntill the
        middle of Aprill.


        The Names.

        Their names are giuen to euery one of them in their seuerall
        titles, as fitly as may best agree with their natures; and
        therefore I shall not neede to speake any further of them.


_Narcissus medioluteus vulgaris._
The common white Daffodill called Primrose Peerlesse.

This Daffodill is so common in euery Country Garden almost through
England, that I doubt I shall but spend my time in vaine, to describe
that which is so well knowne, yet for their sakes that know it not,
I will set downe the description of it in this manner. It hath long
limber and broad leaues, of a grayish greene colour, among which riseth
vp a stalke, bearing at the toppe out of a skinnie huske sometimes
but one flower, but most commonly two flowers, and seldome three or
more, but larger for the most part, then any that beare many flowers
vpon a stalke, of a pale whitish Creame colour, tending somewhat neare
vnto the colour of a pale Primrose (which hath caused our Countrey
Gentlewomen, I thinke, to entitle it Primrose Peerlesse) with a small
round flat Crowne, rather then a cup in the middle, of a pale yellow
colour, with some pale chiues standing therein, being of a sweete, but
stuffing sent: the roote is reasonable great, and encreasing more then
a better plant.


_Narcissus mediocroceus serotinus._   The late flowring white Daffodill.

This Daffodill hath much smaller leaues, and shorter then the last,
the stalke also riseth not so high by much, and beareth but one flower
thereon, of a pure white colour, made of six small leaues, and somewhat
narrow, standing seuerally one from another, and not so close together
as the former, but appearing like a starre: the cup is small and round,
of a pale yellow colour, but saffrony about the brims, hauing six small
pale chiues in the middle, the smell whereof is much sweeter then in
the former.


        The Place.

        The first is thought to grow naturally in England, but I could
        neuer heare of his naturall place. I am sure it is plentifull
        enough in all Country Gardens, so that wee scarce giue it place
        in our more curious parkes. The second liueth only with them
        that delight in varieties.


        The Time.

        The first Daffodill flowreth in the middle time, being neither
        of the earliest, nor of the latest; but about the middle, or
        end of April. The other flowreth with the latest in May.


        The Names.

        I shall not neede to trouble you with further repetitions of
        names, they hauing been set downe in their titles, which are
        proper to them.

1. _Narcissus medio purpureus præcox._
The early purple ringed Daffodill.

This early Daffodill hath many long grayish greene leaues, somewhat
narrower and stiffer than the former common white Daffodill, among
which riseth vp a long naked hollow stalke (as all other Daffodils
haue) bearing at the toppe one flower, and seldome two, made of sixe
long white leaues, standing close together about the stalke; the cup
is yellow, and so flat, that it might rather bee called a crowne: for
it standeth very close to the middle, and very open at the brimmes,
circled with a reddish or purple coloured ring, hauing certaine chiues
in the middle of it also. The smell hereof is very sweete, exceeding
many other.


2. _Narcissus medio purpureus serotinus._
The late purple ringed Daffodill.

The leaues of this Daffodill are alwayes broader then the former early
one, and some are very neare twice as broad: the flower is very like
the former, being large, and his leaues standing close one to the side
of another; the ring likewise that compasseth the yellow coronet, is
sometimes of a paler reddish purple, and sometimes as deep a red as the
former: so that it differeth not in any other materiall point, then
that it flowreth not vntill the other is past and gone. The sent of
this is like the former, the roote hereof is greater, as well as the
leafe and flower.


3. _Narcissus medio purpureus maximus._
The great white purple ringed Daffodill.

There is another kinde, whose flower (as well as leaues and rootes) is
larger then any other of this kinde, which only maketh it a distinct
sort from the other: it flowreth also with the later sort of these
purple ringed Daffodils.


4. _Narcissus medio purpureus stellaris._
The starry purple ringed Daffodill.

This Daffodill hath his leaues a little narrower and greener then the
former sorts, the flower also of this hath his sixe white leaues not
so broad, but narrower, and seeming longer then they, not closing
together, but standing apart one from another, making it seem like a
white starre: it hath also a yellow coronet in the middle, circled
about with purple, like the former. This doth smell nothing so sweete
as the first but yet hath a good sent.


        The Place.

        The first, third, and fourth of these Daffodils, haue always
        beene sent vs from Constantinople among other bulbous rootes,
        so that wee know no further of their naturall places.

        The second groweth in many places of Europe, both in Germany,
        France, and Italy, as Clusius hath noted.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth very early in March, euen with the first
        Daffodils. The second, third, and fourth, about a moneth after.


        The Names.

        The early and starre Daffodils, haue been sent vs by the
        Turkish name of _Deuebohini_, and _Serincade_. But their names,
        they haue receiued since, to bee endenizond with vs, are set
        downe in their seuerall titles.


_Narcissus Persicus._   The Persian Daffodill.

This Persian Daffodill differeth from all other kindes of Daffodils in
his manner of growing, for it neuer hath leaues and flowers at one
time together, wherein it is like vnto a Colchicum, yet in roote and
leafe it is a Daffodill. The roote is a little blackish on the outside,
somewhat like the roote of the Autumne Daffodill, from whence riseth vp
a naked foote stalke, bearing one pale yellow flower, breaking through
a thinne skinne, which first enclosed it, composed of six leaues, the
three outermost being a little larger then the rest, in the middle of
the flower there are six small chiues, and a longer pointell. The whole
flower is of an vnpleasant sent. After the flower is past, come vp the
leaues, sometimes before Winter, but most vsually after the deepe of
Winter is past with vs, in the beginning of the yeare, which are broad,
long, and of a pale greene colour, like the leaues of other Daffodils,
but not greene as the Autumne Daffodill is, and besides they doe a
little twine themselues, as some of the Pancratium, or bastard Sea
Daffodils doe.


_Narcissus Autumnalis maior._   The greater Autumne or Winter Daffodill.

The greater Autumne Daffodill riseth vp with three or foure faire broad
and short leaues at the first, but afterwards grow longer, of a very
deepe or darke greene colour, in the middle of which riseth vp a short,
stiffe, rounded footestalke, bearing one faire yellow flower on the
head thereof (inclosed at the first in a thinne skinne, or huske) and
consisteth of six leaues as the former, with certaine chiues in the
middle, as all or most other Daffodils haue, which passeth away without
shew of any seed, or head for seed, although vnder the head there is a
little greene knot, which peraduenture would beare seede, if our sharpe
Winters did not hinder it. The roote is great and round, couered ouer
with a blackish skinne or coate.


_Narcissus Autumnalis minor._   The lesser Autumne or Winter Daffodill.

Clusius setteth downe, that the manner of the flowring of this lesser
Daffodill, is more like vnto the Persian Daffodill, then vnto the
former greater Autumne kind; but I doe fine that it doth in the same
sort, as the greater kinde, rise vp with his leaues first, and the
flowers a while after: the flower of this is lesser, and a little paler
then the flower of the greater kinde, but consisting in like sort of
six leaues, narrow and sharpe pointed; the greene leaues also are
almost of as deepe a green colour, as the greater kinde, but smaller
and narrower, and a little hollow in the middle. The roote is also
alike, but lesser, and couered with a blackish skinne as the former.
This hath sometimes borne blacke round seede in three square heads.


        The Place.

        The Persian Daffodill hath beene sent sometimes, but very
        seldome, among other roots from Constantinople, and it is
        probable by the name whereby it was sent, that it should
        naturally grow in Persia.

        The other two haue likewise beene sent from Constantinople, and
        as it is thought, grow in Thracia, or thereabouts.


        The Time.

        They all doe flower much about one time, that is, about the end
        of September, and in October.


        The Names.

        The first hath been sent by the name of _Serincade Persiana_,
        and thereupon is called _Narcissus Persicus_, The Persian
        Daffodill.

        The other two haue been thought by diuers to be Colchica, and
        so haue they called them, vpon no other ground, but that their
        flower is in forme and time somewhat like Colchicum, when as
        if they had marked them better, they might plainly discerne,
        that in all other things they did resemble Daffodils; but now
        the names of _Colchicum luteum maius, & minus_, is quite
        lost, time hauing worne them out, and they are called by most
        Herbarists now adayes, _Narcissus Autumnalis maior & minor_,
        The greater and the lesser Autumne Daffodill.

Thus farre haue I proceeded with those Daffodils, that hauing broad
leaues, beare but one single flower, or two at the most vpon a stalke:
And now to proceed with the rest, that haue broad leaues, and beare
single flowers, but many vpon a stalke.


_Narcissus Africanus aureus maior._
The great yellow Daffodill of Africa.

This braue and stately Daffodill hath many very long and broad leaues,
of a better green colour, then many others that are grayish, among
which appeareth a stalke, not rising to the height of the leaues,
bearing at the toppe out of a skinnie hose many faire, goodly, and
large flowers, to the number of ten or twelue, if the roote bee well
growne, and stand in a warme place, euery one being larger then any
of the French, Spanish, or Turkie Daffodils, that beare many single
flowers vpon a stalke, and commeth neere vnto the bignesse of the
English Daffodill, called Primrose Peerlesse, before described, or that
French kinde hereafter described, that beareth the largest flowers,
many vpon a stalke (which some would make to bee a kinde of English
Daffodill, but bearing more flowers) and of a faire shining yellow
colour, hauing large, round, and open cups or boules, yellower then the
outer leaues; and is of so exceeding sweete a sent, that it doth rather
offend the senses by the aboundance thereof: the roote is great, and
couered with a blackish browne coate or skinne.


_Narcissus Africanus aureus minor._   The lesser Barbary Daffodill.

This lesser kinde is very neere the same with the former, but that it
lacketh somewhat of his statlinesse of height, largenesse of flower and
cup (being a paler yellow) and beauty of colour, for it beareth neither
of these equall vnto the former, but is in them all inferiour. And thus
by this priuatiue, you may vnderstand his positive, and that shall be
sufficient at this time.


_Narcissus Byzantinus totus luteus._   The yellow Turkie Daffodill.

Whereas the last described, came short of the beauty of the former, so
this lacketh of that beauty is in the last; for this, although it haue
very long leaues, and a high stalke, yet the flowers are neither so
many, as not being aboue foure or fiue, nor so large, being not much
greater then the ordinary French Daffodill hereafter described, nor the
colour so faire, but much paler, and the cup also smaller; and herein
consisteth the chiefest differences betweene this, and both the other,
but that the sent of this is also weaker.


        The Place.

        The first and the second grow in Barbary, about Argiers, and
        Fez, as by the relation of them, that haue brought them into
        these parts, wee haue been enformed.

        The last hath been often brought from Constantinople among
        other varieties of Daffodils, but from whence they receiued
        them, I could neuer learne.


        The Time.

        These Daffodils do flower very early, euen with the first sort
        of Daffodils, I meane after they haue been accustomed vnto our
        climate: for oftentimes vpon their first bringing ouer, they
        flower in Ianuary or February, especially if they be preserued
        from the frosts, and kept in any warme place; for they are very
        tender, and will soone perish, being left abroad.


        The Names.

        The first is called by diuers in French, _Narcisse d’ Algiers_
        and in many places of the Low Countries, _Narcissen van Heck_,
        or _Narcissus Heckius_; by diuers others _Narcissus Africanus
        aureus maior_, we may call it in English, The great African
        Daffodill, or the great Barbary Daffodill, or the great yellow
        Daffodill of Argiers, which you please.

        The second hath no other variation of name, then a diminutiue
        of the former, as is set downe in the title.

        The third is no doubt the same, that Clusius setteth downe
        in the twelfth Chapter of his second Booke of the History of
        more rare plants, and maketh the fourth sort, which came from
        Constantinople, and may also be the same, which he maketh his
        fifth, which (as he saith) he receiued from Doctour _Simor
        Touar_ of Seuill in Spaine. Wee call it, from the place from
        whence we receiued it, _Narcissus Byzantinus_, with the
        addition of _totus luteus_, to put a difference from other
        sorts that come from thence also: in English, The yellow single
        Daffodill of Turkie.


_Narcissus Sulphureus maior._ The greater Lemon coloured Daffodill.

The greater of these Daffodils, beareth three or foure greene and very
long leaues, a foote and a halfe long at the least, among which riseth
vp a round, yet crested stalke, not so high as the leaues, bearing
fiue or sixe single flowers thereon, euery one of them being greater
then the ordinary French or Italian Daffodils, with many flowers vpon
a stalke; of a faint, but yet pleasant yellow colour at the first,
which after they haue been in flower a fortnight or thereabouts, change
into a deeper, or more sullen yellow colour: the cup in the middle is
likewise larger, then in those formerly named, and of a deeper yellow
colour then the outer leaues, hauing onely three chiues within it. The
smell is very pleasant.


_Narcissus Sulphureus minor._ The lesser Lemon coloured Daffodill.

This lesser Daffodill hath broader and shorter leaues then the former,
of the colour of other Daffodils, and not greene like the former: the
stalke of this riseth vp higher then the leaues, bearing foure or
fiue flowers vpon shorter footestalkes, and no bigger then the French
Daffodill, of a pale yellow, which most doe call a Brimstone colour,
the cup or rather crowne in the middle, is small, and broad open, of a
little deeper yellow, hauing many chiues within it, and is as it were
sprinkled ouer with a kinde of mealinesse. The smell of this is not
full so pleasant as the former.


        The Place.

        Both these haue been gathered on the Pyrenæan Mountaines, and
        both likewise haue been sent out of Italy.


        The Time.

        They both flower in the middle time of the Daffodils flowring,
        that is, in Aprill.


        The Name.

        They haue their Latine names expressed in their titles and so
        are their English also, if you please so to let them passe; or
        else according to the Latine, you may call them, The greater
        and the lesser Brimstone coloured Daffodils; some haue called
        them _Narcissus Italicus_, but the Italians themselues haue
        sent them by the name of _Narcisso Solfarigno_.


_Narcissus totus albus polyanthos._
The milke white Daffodill many vpon a stalke.

The leaues of this Daffodill are of a meane size, both for length
and breadth, yet somewhat greener then in the ordinary sorts, that
haue some whitenesse in them: the flowers are many vpon the stalke,
as small for the most part, as any of these kindes that beare many
together, being wholly of a milke, or rather snow white colour, both
the cuppe, which is small, and the outer leaues that compasse it; after
which come small heads, wherein is contained round blacke seede, as
all other Daffodils doe, although some greater, and others lesser,
according to the proportion of the plants: the roote is couered ouer
with a blackish skinne or coate; the smell is very sweete.

There are two other sorts more of this kinde, the differences whereof
are, that the one hath his leaues somewhat broader, and the flowers
greater then the former: And the other smaller leaues and flowers also,
whose cups being small, are neuer seene fully open, but as it were
halfe closed at the brimmes.


_Narcissus latifolius totus albus, mediocri calice reflexus._
The milke white Daffodill with the great cup.

There is yet another sort of these milke white Daffodils, whose leaues
are as broad as any of the former, and whose cup in the middle of the
flower, is somewhat larger then in any of the lesser sorts, and lesser
then in the greater kinde: but the leaues of the flowers doe a little
turne themselues vpwards, which maketh a chiefe difference.


        The Place.

        These Daffodils grow in Spaine, from whence I receiued many
        that flourished a while, but perished by some fierce cold
        Winters: they likewise grow in France, from whence many also
        haue been brought vnto vs. They haue likewise been sent from
        Constantinople to vs, among other kindes of Daffodils.


        The Time.

        They that come from Constantinople, for the most part doe
        flower earlier then the other, euen after they are accustomed
        to our ayre. Some of them flower notwithstanding in the end of
        March, the rest in Aprill.


        The Names.

        They are vsually called _Narcissus totus albus polyanthos_,
        adding thereunto the differences of _maior_, _medius_, and
        _minor_, that is, The milke white Daffodill, the greater, the
        middle, and the lesser; for so some doe distinguish them. The
        last, for distinction, hath his name in his title sufficient to
        expresse him.


1. _Narcissus Narbonensis, siue medio luteus præcox._
The early French Daffodill.

The leaues of this Daffodill, spring vp out of the ground a moneth or
two sometimes before the other of this kinde, that follow; being also
shorter and narrower: the stalke likewise is not very high, bearing
diuers flowers at the top, breaking through a thinne skinne, as is
vsuall with all the Daffodils, euery one whereof is small, consisting
of six white leaues, and small yellow cup in the middle, which is of
a prettie small sent, nothing so strong as many others: the roote is
great and round, and seldome parteth into of-sets, euen as all the
other that follow, bearing many single flowers, doe.

        of Africa.
   2 _Narcissus Africanus luteus minor._ The lesser yellow Daffodill
        of Africa.
   3 _Narcissus Narbonensis medio luteus._ The French Daffodill.

   5 _Narcissus Mussart._ Mussart his Daffodill.
   6 _Narcissus Anglicus polyanthos._ The great English Daffodill.
]


2. _Narcissus Narbonensis vulgaris._   The ordinary French Daffodill.

This Daffodill hath long and broad greene leaues, a little hollowish
in the middle, and edged on both sides; the stalke is a foote and a
halfe high, bearing at the toppe diuers flowers, somewhat larger then
the former, consisting of six white leaues, somewhat round; the cup is
yellow in the middle, small and round, like vnto an Acorne cuppe, or a
little fuller in the middle: this is the forme of that sort which was
first brought vnto vs: But since there is found out some, whose cup
is shorter, others flatter, some of a paler, others of a deeper yellow
colour, and some that haue their cuppe longer then the rest. The rootes
of them all are couered with a blackish skin or coate.


3. _Narcissus Narbonensis maior amplo flore._
The French Daffodill with great flowers.

The leaues of this Daffodill are somewhat like vnto the last, but
not so broad, yet full as long, and spring sooner out of the ground,
yet not so early as the first of these kindes: the stalke hereof is
flatter, and riseth higher, bearing foure or fiue flowers, much larger
then any of this kinde; for euery one of them doth equall the English
Daffodill, before described, but whiter then it, and the yellow cup
larger, and more open then in any of the rest. The roote of this is not
so great, or round, as the former, but is more plentifull in of-sets,
then any other of these French, or Italian kindes.


4. _Narcissus Pisanus._   The Italian Daffodill.

This Italian Daffodill hath his leaues as large, or larger then the
second French Daffodill, and his stalke somewhat higher, bearing many
white flowers, very like vnto the common French Daffodill, but somewhat
larger also; and the yellow cup in the middle likewise is larger, and
rounder, then is vsually seen in any of the French kinds, except the
last with the greatest flowers.


5. _Narcissus mediocroceus polyanthos._
The French Daffodill with Saffron coloured cups.

This French Daffodill hath diuers leaues of a grayish greene colour,
not so broad or long as the last recited Daffodill, but comming neerer
vnto the second French kinde, the flowers likewise are white, and many
vpon a stalke, like thereunto, but the yellow cup is somewhat large,
and circled with a Saffron like brimme or edge, which maketh the
chiefest difference.


6. _Narcissus mediocroceus alter, dictus Mussart._
Mussart his Daffodill.

The affinity between this & the last, (for it is not the same to be
expressed vnder one title) hath made me ioyne it next vnto it, yet
because it hath a notable difference, it deserueth a place by himselfe.
The leaues are large and long, and the flowers, being white, are
larger also then in any other, except the greatest, but the cup hereof
is small and short, rather seeming a coronet then a cup, of a deepe
Saffron colour all about the brimmes or edges.


7. _Narcissus Anglicus polyanthos._   The great English Daffodill.

This Daffodill hath his leaues not much broader or longer, then the
French kinde with great flowers, before described, the stalke with
flowers riseth not fully so high as it, bearing many flowers thereon,
not altogether so white, yet whiter then the former English Daffodill,
called Primrose Peerlesse, but nothing so large, and with short, broad,
and almost round leaues, standing close one vnto another: the yellow
cup in the middle is bowle fashion, being somewhat deeper then in any
of the former kinds, but not much greater: the smell hereof is very
sweete and pleasant.


8. _Narcissus Narbonensis, siue medio luteus serotinus maior._
The greater late flowring French Daffodill.

The roote as well as the leaues of this Daffodill, are greater, larger,
broader, and longer then in any other of the former French, or Italian
kindes; the stalke is as high as any of them, bearing at the toppe fiue
or sixe white flowers, standing open spread like a starre, and not
close together, euery one whereof is large, and round pointed, the cup
is yellow, small and short, yet not lying flat to the flower, but a
little standing out with some threads in the middle, as all the former
Daffodils haue. This is not so sweete as the earlier kindes.


9. _Narcissus medioluteus alter serotinus calice breui._
The lesser late flowring French Daffodill.

This Daffodill is of the same kinde with the last described, the onley
difference is, that it is lesser, and the yellow cuppe in the middle of
the flower, is somewhat shorter then the former, although the former be
shorter then many others, otherwise it differeth not, no not in time;
for it flowreth late as the former doth.


        The Place.

        These Daffodils haue been brought vs from diuers places; The
        first and second grow naturally in many places of Spaine, that
        are open to the Sea: they grow likewise about Mompelier, and
        those parts in France. They haue been likewise sent among many
        other sorts of Daffodils from Constantinople, so that I may
        thinke, they grow in some places neere thereunto.

        The fourth groweth plentifully in Italy, about Pisa in Tuscane,
        from whence we haue had plants to furnish our Gardens.

        The seuenth is accounted beyond Sea to be naturall of our
        Country, but I know not any with vs that haue it, but they haue
        had it from them.

        The rest haue been brought at diuers times, but wee know no
        further of their naturall places.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth earlier then any of the rest by a moneth,
        euen in the beginning of March, or earlier, if the weather
        be milde. The other in Aprill, some a little before or after
        another. The late kinds flower not vntill May.


        The Names.

        There can be no more said of the names of any of them, then
        hath beene set out in their titles; for they distinguish euery
        sort as fitly as we can: onely some doe call the first two
        sorts, by the name of _Donax Narbonensis_.

After all these Daffodils, that hauing broad leaues beare single
flowers, either one or many vpon a stalke, I shall now goe on to set
forth those broad leafed Daffodils, that carry double flowers, either
one or many vpon a stalke together, in the same order that we haue vsed
before.


1. _Narcissus albus multiplex._   The double white Daffodill.

The leaues of this Daffodill are not very broad, but rather of a meane
size, being of the same largenesse with the leaues of the purple
ringed Daffodill, the stalke riseth vp to be a foote and a halfe
high, bearing out of a thinne white skinne or hose, one flower and no
more, consisting of many leaues, of a faire white colour, the flower
is larger then any other double white Daffodill, hauing euery leafe,
especially the outermost, as large almost as any leafe of the single
Daffodill with the yellow cup, or purple ring. Sometimes it happeneth,
that the flower is very little double, and almost single, but that
is either in a bad ground, or for that it hath stood long in a place
without remouing; for then it hath such a great encrease of rootes
about it, that it draweth away into many parts, the nourishment that
should be for a few: but if you doe transplant it, taking away the
of-sets, and set his rootes single, it will then thriue, and beare his
flower as goodly and double, as I haue before described it: and is very
sweete.


2. _Narcissus mediopurpureus multiplex._
The double purple ringed Daffodill.

There is little difference in the leaues of this kinde, from the leaues
of the single purple ringed Daffodill; for it is probable it is of
the same kinde, but by natures gift (and not by any humane art) made
more plentifull, which abideth constant, and hath not that dalliance,
which oftentimes nature sheweth, to recreate the senses of men for
the present, and appeareth not againe in the same forme: the chiefest
difference is, that the flower (being but sometimes one on a stalke,
and sometimes two) consisteth of six white outer leaues, as large as
the leaues of the single kinde, hauing many small yellow peeces, edged
with purple circles round about them, instead of a cup; and in the
middle of these peeces, stand other six white leaues, lesser then the
former, and a yellow cup edged with a purple circle likewise, parted
into peeces, and they comprehend a few other white leaues, smaller than
any of the other, hauing among them some broken peeces of the cup,
with a few chiues also in the middle of the flower. The flower is very
sweete.

There is of this kinde another, whose flower hath not so plaine a
distinction, of a triple rowe of leaues in it: but the whole flower is
confusedly set together, the outer leaues being not so large, and the
inner leaues larger then the former; the broken yellow cuppe, which is
tipt with purple, running diuersly among the leaues; so that it sheweth
a fairer, and more double flower then the former, as it is indeed.


3. _Narcissus medioluteus corona duplici._
The Turkie Daffodill with a double crowne.

This Daffodill hath three or foure leaues, as large and long almost, as
the great double Daffodill of Constantinople next following hath: the
stalke likewise is very neere as great, but as high altogether, bearing
at the toppe foure or fiue flowers, the leaues whereof are as large,
as of the first or second kinde of French Daffodils, before described,
but not altogether of so pure a white colour; and being six in number,
stand like the former single French Daffodils, but that the yellow cup
in the middle of this is thicke and double, or as it were crumpled
together, not standing very high to be conspicuous, but abiding lowe
and short, so that it is not presently marked, vnlesse one looke vpon
it precisely; yet is exceeding sweete. The roote is like vnto the roote
of the purple ringed Daffodill, or somewhat bigger.


4. _Narcissus Chalcedonicus flore pleno albo polyanthos._
The double white Daffodill of Constantinople.

This beautifull and goodly Daffodill (wherewith all Florists greatly
desire to bee acquainted, as well for the beauty of his double flowers,
as also for his superabounding sweete smell, one stalke with flowers
being instead of a nosegay) hath many very broad, and very long leaues,
somewhat greener then gray, among which riseth vp a strong round
stalke, being sometimes almost flat, and ribbed, bearing foure or
fiue, or more white flowers at the toppe, euery one being very great,
large, and double, the leaues being confusedly set together, hauing
little peeces of a yellow cup running among them, without any shew of
that purple ring that is in the former, and fall away without bearing
seed, euen as all, or most other double flowers doe: the smell is so
exceeding sweet and strong, that it will soone offend the senses of
any, that shall smell much vnto it: the roote is great and thicke,
couered with a blackish coate.


5. _Narcissus Chalcedonicus fimbriatus multiplex polyanthos._
The great double purple ringed Daffodill of Constantinople.

This Daffodill differeth very little or nothing in leafe from the
former, the onely difference is in the flowers, which although they bee
double, and beare many vpon a stalke, like vnto them, yet this hath the
peeces of the yellow cuppes tipt with purple, as if they were shred
or scattered among the white leaues, whereas the other hath only the
yellow, without any shew of purple tips vpon them: the smell of this is
as strong as of the other.

        Daffodill.
   4 _Narcissus Chalcedonicus flore pleno albo polyanthos._ The double
        white Daffodill of Constantinople.
]


6. _Narcissus Cyprius flore pleno lutes polyanthos._
The double yellow Daffodill of Cyprus.

The leaues of this Daffodill are almost as broad and long as the
former, the stalke is a foot high and more, bearing foure or fiue
flowers on the top, euery one very double, and of a fine pale yellow
colour, of a strong heady sent. The root of this is also like the
former.


        The Place.

        The first of these Daffodils, was full brought into England
        by Mʳ. Iohn de Franqueuille the elder, who gathered it in his
        owne Countrey of Cambray, where it groweth wild, from whose
        sonne, Mʳ. Iohn de Franqueuille, now liuing, we all haue had
        it. The rest haue come from Constantinople at seuerall times;
        and the last is thought to come from Cyprus. Wee haue it
        credibly affirmed also, that it groweth in Barbary about Fez
        and Argiers. Some of the double white kindes grow in Candy, and
        about Aleppo also.


        The Time.

        The Turkie kindes doe for the most part all flower early, in
        the end of March, or beginning of Aprill at the furthest, and
        the first double, about the middle or end of April.


        The Names.

        All these Daffodils, except the first, haue had diuers Turkish
        names set vpon the packets, wherein they haue been sent, but
        there is small regard of certainty to be expected from them;
        for that the name _Serincade_, without any more addition, which
        is a single Daffodill, hath beene imposed vpon that parcell of
        rootes, that have borne most of them double flowers of diuers
        sorts; and the name _Serincade Catamer lale_ which signifieth a
        double flowered Daffodill, hath had many single white flowers,
        with yellow cups, and some whose flowers have been wholly
        white, cuppe and all, and some purple ringed, and double also
        among them. Their names, whereby they are knowne and called
        with vs, are, as fitly as may be, imposed in their titles: And
        this I hope shall suffice, to have spoken of these sorts of
        Daffodils.

Hauing finished the discourse of the former sort of broad leafed
Daffodils, it is fit to proceede to the next, which are _Angustifolios
Narcissos_, those Daffodils that have narrow leaures, and first to set
down those that beare single flowers, whether one or many flowers vpon
a stalke, and then those that beare double flowers in the same manner.


_Narcissus Virginens._   The Virginia Daffodill.

This plant I thought fittest to place here in the beginning of this
_Classis_, not finding where better to shroud it. It hath two or three
long, and very narrow leaues, as greene as the leaues of the great
_Leucoium bulbosum_, and shining withall, which grow sometimes reddish,
especially at the edges: the stalke riseth vp a spanne high, bearing
one flower and no more on the head thereof, standing vpright like a
little Lilly or Tulipa, made of six leaues, wholly white, both within
and without, except that at the bottome next to the stalke, and a
little on the backside of the three outer leaues, it hath a small dash
or shew of a reddish purple colour: it hath in the middle a few chiues,
standing about a small head pointed; which head groweth to bee small
and long, containing small blackish flat seede: the roote is small,
long, and round, a little blackish on the outside, and white on the
inside.


        The Place.

        This bulbous plant was brought vs from Virginia, where they
        grow aboundantly; but they hardly thriue and abide in our
        Gardens to beare flowers.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in May, and seldome before.


        The Names.

        The Indians in Virginia do call it _Attamusco_, some among vs
        do call it _Lilionarcissus Virginianus_, of the likenesse of
        the flower to a Lilly, and the leaues and roote to a Daffodill.
        Wee for breuity doe called it _Narcissus Virgineus_, that is,
        The Daffodill of Virginia, or else you may call it according to
        the former Latine name, The Lilly Daffodill of Virginia, which
        you will; for both names may serue well to expresse the plant.


_Narcissus angustifolius albidus præcox oblongo calice._
The early white narrow leafed Daffodill with a long cup.

This Daffodill hath three or foure narrow, long, and very green leaues,
a foot long for the most part: the stalke riseth not vp so high as the
leaves, whereon standeth one flower, not altogether so great as the
late flowring Daffodill, with a long cuppe, described before among
the broad leafed ones, which consisteth of six pale coloured leaves,
not pure white, but hauing a wash of light yellow among the white:
the cuppe in the middle is round and long, yet not so long as to bee
accounted a bastard Daffodill, within which is a middle pointell,
compassed with six chiues, hauing yellow mealy pendents.


        The Place.

        The Daffodill groweth with the other sorts of broad leafed
        ones, on the Pyrenæan Mountaines, from whence they have beene
        brought vnto vs, to furnish our Gardens.


        The Time.

        It flowreth early, a month before the other sorts of the same
        fashion, that is, in the beginning of March, if the time be
        milde, which the other before spoken of the doe not.


        The Names.

        It hath no other name that I know, then is expressed in the
        title.


2. _Narcissus mediocroceus tenuifolius._
The small Daffodill with a Saffron crown.

This small Daffodill hath foure or fiue narrow leaues, about a spanne
long, among which riseth vp a stalke some nine inches high, bearing
at the toppe one small white flower, made of six leaues, with a small
yellow cup in the middle, shadowed ouer at the brimmes with a Saffron
colour: the roote is small, rounded, and little long withall, couered
with a blackish skinne or coate.


3. _Narcissus minimus mediopurpureus._
The least purple ringed Daffodill.

This little Daffodill hath small narrow leaues, shorter by much then
any of the purple ringed Daffodils, before described: the stalke and
flower keepe an equal proportion to the rest of the plant, being in
forme and colour of the flower, like vnto the Starre Daffodill before
recited, but vnlike in the greatnesse: this also is to bee obserued,
that the purple colour that circleth the brimmes of the cuppe, is so
small, that sometimes it is not well perceiued.


4. _Narcissus minimus Iuncifolij flore._   The least Daffodill of all.

This least Daffodill hath two or three whitish greene leaues, narrower
then the two last recited Daffodils, and shorter by halfe, being but
aboue two or three inches long, the stalke likewise is not aboue three
or foure inches high, bearing one single flower at the toppe, somewhat
bigger then the smalnesse of the plant should seeme to beare, very like
vnto the least Rush Daffodill, and of the same bignesse, or rather
somewhat bigger, being of a faint yellow colour, both leaues, and
cup, or crowne, (if you please so to call it); for the middle part is
spread very much, euen to the middle of the leaues almost, and lyeth
flat open vpon the flower: the roote is small, euen the smallest of any
Daffodill, and couered with a blackish skinne or coate.


        The Place.

        The first of these Daffodils haue beene brought vs from the
        Pyrenæan Mountaines, among a number of other rare plants, and
        the last by a French man, called Francis le Veau, the honestest
        roote-gatherer that euer came ouer to vs. The second was sent
        to Mʳ. Iohn de Franqueuille, before remembred, who imparted
        it to mee, as hee hath done many other good things; but his
        naturall place wee know not.


        The Time.

        They all flower about the latter end of Aprill.


        The Names.

        Being brought without names, wee haue giuen them their names
        according to their face and fashion, as they are set downe in
        their titles.


_Narcissus Autumnalis minor albus._
The little white Autumne Daffodill.

This little Autumne Daffodill riseth with his flowers first out of the
ground, without any leaues at all. It springeth vp with one or two
stalkes about a finger long, euery one bearing out of a small huske
one small white flower, laid open abroad like vnto the Starre white
Daffodill, before spoken of: in the middle of the flower is a small
yellow cup of a meane size, and after the flower is past, there commeth
in the same place a small head, containing small, round, blacke seede,
like vnto the Autumne Hyacinth: the leaues come vp after the seede is
ripe and gone, being small and narrow, not much bigger then the Autumne
Hyacinth: the roote is small and blackish on the outside.


        The Place.

        This Daffodill groweth in Spaine, where Clusius saw it, and
        brought it into these parts.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in the beginning of Autumne, and his seede is ripe
        in the end of October in those hot Countries, but in ours it
        will scarce abide to shew a flower.


        The Names.

        The Spaniards, as Clusius reporteth, call it _Tonada_, and he
        vpon the sight thereof, _Narcissus Autumnalis minor albus_,
        and wee in English thereafter, The little white Autumne
        Daffodill.

]


_Narcissus albus Autumnalis medio obsoletus._
The white Autumne Daffodill with a sullen crowne.

This Autumne Daffodill hath two or three leaues at the most, and very
narrow, so that some doe reckon it among the Rush Daffodils, being
somewhat broad at the bottome, and more pointed at the toppe, betweene
these leaues commeth vp the stalke, bearing vsually two flowers and no
more at the toppe, made of sixe white leaues a peece, pointed and not
round: the cup is small and round like vnto the cup or crowne of the
least Rush Daffodill, of a yellow colour at the bottome but toward the
edge of a dunne or sullen colour.


_Narcissus angustifolius luteus semper florens Caccini._
The yellow Italian Daffodill of Caccini.

This Daffodill beareth a number of small, long, narrow, and very greene
leaues, broader then the leaues of any Rush Daffodill, among which
rise vp diuers stalkes, bearing at the head two or three flowers a
peece, each of them being small and yellow, the cup or crowne is small
also, of a deeper yellow then the flower. The Nobleman of Florence,
who first sent this plant to Christian Porret at Leyden, after the
death of Carolus Clusius, writeth that euery stalke doth beare with him
more store of flowers, then are formerly set downe, and that it neuer
ceaseth to beare flowers, but that after one or more stalkes haue been
in flower together, and are past, there succeed other in their places.


        The Place.

        The first is naturall of Spain, the naturall place of the other
        is not known to vs.


        The Time.

        The times of the flowring, are set downe both in the title and
        in the descriptions; the one to be in Autumne, the other to be
        all the Summer long.


        The Names.

        The Latine names are imposed on them, as are fittest for them,
        and the last by that honourable man that sent it, which is most
        fit to continue, and not to bee changed. But wee, to let it bee
        knowne by an English name to English people, haue entituled it,
        The yellow Italian Daffodill of Caccini: if any man can giue it
        a more proper name, I shall bee therewith right well content.


_Narcissus angustifolius, siue Iuncifolius maximus, amplo calice._
The great Iunquilia with the large flower or cup.

Although this Daffodill importeth by his name, not to be of this
family, but of the next, considering it is so like vnto them, but
bigger; yet I haue thought good to place it in the end of these narrow
leafed Daffodils, as being indifferent, whether it should bee referred
to this or to that. For this carrieth diuers long green leaues, like
vnto the other Rush Daffodils, but thicker and broader, so that it
may without any great errour, bee reckoned among these narrow leafed
Daffodils, bearing at the toppe two or three very faire large flowers,
with a large and more open cuppe, then in any other of the Rush
Daffodils, both of them of a faire yellow colour, yet the cuppe a
little deeper then the flower, and a little crumpled about the edges,
and both a pretty sharpe sent: the roote is greater and longer then the
other Rush Daffodill, and couered likewise with a blackish coate.


        The Place.

        We haue this in Gardens onely, and haue not heard of his
        naturall place.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in Aprill.


        The Names.

        I leaue it indifferent, as I said, whether you will call it
        _Narcissus angustifolius_, or _Iuncifolius magno calice_, or
        _maximus_, because it is the greatest of all the rest of that
        kinde.


_Narcissus totus albus flore pleno Virginianus._
The double white Daffodill of Virginia.

The roote of this Daffodill, is very like vnto the former single
Virginia Daffodill, set forth in the first place of this ranke of
narrow leafed Daffodils, but that it is a little bigger and rounder,
being a little long withall, and blackish also on the outside, as that
is: from whence riseth vp two leaues, somewhat broader then the former:
but of a like greennesse: the stalke riseth vp betweene these two
leaues, about a span high, or not much higher, bearing one faire double
snow white flower, very like in the fashion vnto the pale yellow double
Daffodill, or bastard Daffodill of Robinus, hereafter described: For
it is in the like manner laid open flat, and composed of six rowes of
leaues, euery rowe lying in order iust opposite, or one before another,
whereof those six leaues that make the first or outermost course, are
the greatest, and all the rest lying, as I said, one vpon or before
another, are euery rowe smaller then others from the middle of this
flower, thrusteth forth a small long pointed forke or horne, white as
the flower is.


        The Place.

        The place is named to be Virginia, but in what part it is not
        known to vs.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in the end of Aprill.


        The Names.

        It may be that this doth grow among the former single kinde,
        and called by the same name Attamusco, for that the plant is
        not much differing, yet hereof I am not certaine: But we, from
        the forme and countenance of the plant, do call it _Narcissus
        Virginianus_, The Virginian Daffodill, and because it beareth a
        double flower, it hath the title of double added vnto it.


The third order of Daffodils, I said in the beginning was of
_Iuncifolios_, Rush Daffodils, which are now next to be entreated of,
I shall herein keepe the same order I vsed in the former; but because
I finde none of this order, that beare but one flower vpon a stalke, I
must begin with those that beare many.


1. _Narcissus Iuncifolius albus._   The white Iunquilia.

This white Rush Daffodill hath small long leaues, a little broader, and
of a whiter greene colour then the ordinary yellow Rush Daffodils: the
stalke riseth vp halfe a foote high or more, bearing two or three small
white flowers vpon a stalke, yet somewhat bigger then the common yellow
Rush Daffodill, hauing a small round cuppe in the middle, white also as
the leaues are. The seede is small, blacke, and round, as other seedes
of Daffodils are: the roote is small and round, couered with a blackish
coate.


_Narcissus Iuncifolius albus magno calice._
The white Iunquilia with a great cup.

There is of this kinde another sort, that hath the cup in the middle
of the flower, a little larger then the other, but in all other things
alike.


2. _Narcissus Iuncifolius flore albo reflexo._
The white turning Iunquilia, or Rush Daffodill.

This turning white Daffodill hath foure or fiue long greene leaues,
yet shorter and broader then the ordinary yellow Iunquilia, and fully
as greene also, from among which riseth vp a slender greene stalke, a
foote high bearing out of a thinne skinnie huske, three or foure, or
more snow white flowers, standing vpon long greene foot-stalkes, euery
flower hanging downe his head, and turning vp his six narrow and long
leaues, euen to the very foot-stalk againe: from the middle of the
flower hangeth downe a long round cuppe, as white as the leaues, within
which are contained three small white chiues, tipt with yellow, and a
small long pointell, thrusting out beyond the brimmes of the cup: after
the flowers are past, there come vp in their places small three square
heads, wherein is contained very small, round, and blacke shining
seede: the roote is small, round, and a little long withall, couered
with a blackish browne coate or skin. The flower is quite without any
good sent, or indeed rather none at all.


3. _Narcissus Iuncifolius flore luteo reflexo._
The yellow turning Iunquilia, or Rush Daffodill.

The leaues of the Rush Daffodill are greater and longer then the
former, and of a paler greene colour: the stalke riseth somewhat
higher, bearing two or three flowers thereon wholly of a gold yellow
colour, both the cuppe and the leaues that turne vp againe.


4. _Narcissus Iuncifolius calice albo reflexis folijs luteis._
The yellow turning Iunquilia with a white cup.

This Daffodill hath his long rush-like leaues standing vpright as the
former, betweene which riseth vp a greene stalke, about a foote high or
more, bearing two or three flowers thereon, whose turning leaues are of
a faire pale yellow, and the cuppe pale white, and not so pure a white
as the former.


5. _Narcissus Iuncifolius calice luteo reflexis folijs albidis._
The white turning Iunquilia with a yellow cup.

As the last had the leaues of the flower that turne vp againe yellow,
and the cuppe whitish, so this hath contrariwise the turning leaues of
a whitish yellow, and the long cup yellower, else in his long green
leaues, or any other thing, there is small difference.


6. _Narcissus Iuncifolius luteus magno calice._
The Iunquilia, or Rush Daffodill with a great cup.

This Rush Daffodill hath bigger leaues, and longer then the ordinary
yellow Rush Daffodill, being a little flat on the one side, and round
on the other, but of the same greennesse with all the rest: the stalke
riseth vp two foote high, bearing two, and sometimes three flowers
thereon, being of a faire yellow colour, with a large open cup in the
middle, of a little deeper yellow colour, like vnto the great Iunquilia
with the large flower, before set downe, whereof this is a kinde, no
doubt; but that is larger and greater then this, both in leafe, flower,
cup, &c. and this onely somewhat lesse in all parts then that.

]


7. _Narcissus Iuncifolius luteus vulgaris maior._
The ordinary Iunquilia, or Rush Daffodill.

This ordinary Rush Daffodill hath foure or fiue long greene round
leaues, like vnto Rushes, whereof it tooke the name: among these leaues
riseth vp the stalke, round and greene, a foote and a halfe high very
often, bearing at the toppe three or foure flowers all yellow, but much
smaller then the last, and so is the cup also: the seede is small and
blacke, inclosed in small cornered heads; the roote is blackish on the
outside. The smell of the flower is very sweete in all these sorts of
Rush Daffodils.


8. _Narcissus Iuncifolius luteus medius_. The smaller Iunquilia, or
Rush Daffodill.

The leaues of this Daffodill are like vnto the former, but smaller and
rounder, the stalke riseth vp so high, nor are the flowers so great,
but the leaues of the flower are a little rounder, and not so pointed
as in the former, in all things else alike, sauing lesser.


9. _Narcissus Iuncifolius luteus minor._
The least Iunquilia, or Rush Daffodill.

This least Daffodill hath fiue or six small greene leaues, a little
broader, and not so long as the last, among which riseth vp a stalke
almost a foote high, bearing one or two small flowers at the toppe, of
a paler yellow colour then the former, with a yellow open cuppe, or
crowne rather in the middle, bigger then in either of the last two: the
roote is very small and blacke, like vnto the last in roundnesse and
colour.


10. _Narcissus Iuncifolius luteus albicantibus lineis distinctus._
The yellow Iunquilia, or Rush Daffodill with white lines.

This Rush Daffodill, hath round, greene, and long leaues, like vnto
the ordinary Rush Daffodill, with a stalke bearing two or three yellow
flowers, hauing leaues somewhat round at the point or end, with a
line or strake of white in the middle of euerie one of them, the cup
is short, and crowne fashion, a little crumpled about the brims: the
seede, roote, or anything else differeth not.


11. _Narcissus Iuncifolius Autumnalis flore viridi._
The Autumne Rush Daffodill with a greene flower.

This strange Rush Daffodill (I call it strange, not onely because it
differeth from all others of this kinde, but also because there are but
few in these parts that haue had it, and fewer that doe still enioy it,
in that it is perished withall that had it) hath but one onely leafe,
very long, round, and greene, in all that euer I saw growing, which
beareth no flower while that greene leafe is fresh, and to bee seene:
but afterwards the stalke riseth vp, being like vnto the former greene
leafe, round, naked, and greene vp to the toppe, where two or three
flowers breake forth out of a small thin skinne, euery one consisting
of six small and narrow greene leaues, very sharpe pointed at the
end, and as it were ending in a small pricke or thorne: in the middle
whereof is a small round cup, or rather crowne, of the same colour with
the leaues and stalke, which flower smelleth very sweete, somewhat like
vnto the rest of the Rush Daffodils: this sheweth not his flower vntill
October, and the frosts quickly following after their flowring, cause
them soone to perish.


12. _Narcissus angustifolius aureus multiplex._
The golden double narrow leafed Daffodill.

The leaues of this Daffodill are very narrow, and of a whitish greene
colour, not aboue foure or fiue inches long, from among which riseth vp
a stalke about a foote high, bearing at the top one flower, consisting
of some outer leaues, which are of a yellow colour, and of many other
leaues in the middle being smaller, and set thicke and round together
of a more yellow gold colour, but with some whiter leaues among them,
the middle part a little pointing forth; the flower standeth long
before it doth perfect his colour, and abideth long in flower before
the colour decay: the roote is in fashion almost like the ordinary
Iunquilia, or Rush Daffodill. I acknowledge this Daffodill hath not his
proper place; but because the figure is set in this table, let it thus
passe at this time.


13. _Narcissus Iuncifolius luteus flore pleno._
The double Iunquilia, or Rush Daffodill.

The double Rush Daffodill hath his long greene leaues round, like
the leaues of the common or ordinary Rush Daffodill, and of the same
bignesse, among which riseth vp a long slender greene stalke, bearing
two or three, seldome more small flowers, yellow and double, that is,
with diuers rowes of leaues, hauing the yellow cup such as is in the
single flower, broken into small threads or peeces, running among the
leaues of the flower, which peeces in some flowers are not so easily
seene, being smaller then in others, this beareth no button or head
vnder the flower for seede, his roote is round and blackish, browne on
the outside, so like vnto the common Rush Daffodill, that it is almost
impossible to know the one from the other.

[Sidenote: _Alter minori flore._]

There is another of this kinde, whose flowers are smaller, and not so
double, one, two, or three at the most vpon a stalke, and of lesse
beauty by much.


        The Place.

        All these Rush Daffodils, doe for the most part grow in Spaine
        and France, and on the Pyrenæan Mountaines, which are betweene
        Spaine and France, which Mountains are the Nourseries of many
        of the finest flowers, that doe adorne the Gardens of these
        louers of natures pride, and gathered in part by industrious,
        learned, generous men, inhabiting neare thereunto, and in part
        by such as make a gaine of their labours, bestowed vpon these
        things. Onely that with the greene flower was gathered in
        Barbary, and imparted vnto vs from France.


        The Time.

        They flower in the Spring, that is, in March and Aprill, except
        such whose time is set downe to be in Autumne.


        The Names.

        Their names are specified in their titles, and therefore I
        shall not need to set downe any further repetitions.


To conclude therefore this discourse of true Daffodils, there remaineth
to speake of the Sea Daffodils, which (as I said in the beginning) is
but one, that is frequent, and doth abide with vs. But there bee some
others found about the Cape of good Hope, and in the West Indies, and
brought vnto these parts rather for ostentation, then continuance,
where they haue flowred onely once (if peraduenture so often) so that
being such strangers, of so remote Countries, and of so diuers natures,
I shall but shew you some of them, rather cursorily then curiously; and
but onely for your satisfaction, giue you knowledge of two or three of
them, that there haue beene seene such in flower, and that they are
scarce to bee seene againe, except they bee fetcht a new euery yeare
that they be seene.


_Narcissus Marinus, siue tertius Matthioli._
The great white Sea Daffodill, or Matthiolus his third Daffodill.

The roote of this Daffodill by long continuance, standing in one place
without being remoued, groweth to be much greater and larger, than
any other Daffodill whatsoeuer, and as bigge as any meane Squilla
or Sea Onion roote, hauing many long, thicke, and white fibres, or
long rootes, diuersly branched, and spread vnder the vpper part of
the earth beside some others that grow downward, and perish not euery
yeare, as the fibres of all, or most of the other Daffodils doe; and
therefore this plant will not thriue, and beare flowers, if it be
often transplanted, but rather desire to abide in one place without
remouing, as I said, and that not to be ouershadowed, or couered
with other herbes standing too neare it, which then will flourish,
and beare aboundantly: from this roote, which is couered with many
blackish coates, ariseth six or seuen, or more leaues, twice so broad
almost, as any of the former Daffodils, but not so long by halfe as
many of them, being but short, in comparison of the breadth, and of a
white greene colour; from the middle of which leaues, as also from the
sides sometimes, springeth vp one or two, or more stalkes, roundish
and thicke, and sometimes a little flat and cornered, a foote high or
somewhat more, bearing at the toppe, out of a skinnie huske, eight,
ten, twelue, or more very large flowers, consisting of six white leaues
a peece, spread or laid open, with a white short cuppe or crowne in the
middle, lying flat vpon the leaues, cut or diuided into six corners
(and not whole, as the cuppe or crowne of any other single Daffodill)
from euery of which edges, or corners of this cup or crowne, standeth
one white long thread, a little crooked or turning vp at the end, tipt
with a yellow pendent, and some other white threads tipt with yellow
pendents, standing also in the middle: after the flower is past, there
come vp great three square heads, wherein the seede is contained, which
is great, blacke, and round, like vnto the seede of other Daffodils,
but greater: the flower hath a reasonable good sent, but not very
strong.


        The Place.

        It was first found by the Sea side, in the Isle of Sardinia,
        and on the high Mountaines also of the same Isle, where it hath
        borne by report, thirty fiue flowers vpon a stalke: it groweth
        likewise about Illyricum, and in diuers other places.


        The Time.

        It springeth later out of the ground then any other Daffodill,
        that is to say, not vntill the later end of March, or beginning
        of Aprill, and flowreth in the end of May, or the beginning of
        Iune: the seede is ripe in the end of Iuly, or beginning of
        August.


        The Names.

        The first that hath made mention of this Daffodill, was
        Matthiolus, who placed it in the third place among his
        Daffodils, and is most vsually now adayes called _Narcissus
        tertius Matthioli_, Matthiolus his third Daffodill, the rather,
        because Clusius vpon a more mature deliberation, first referred
        it thereunto, but called it at the first, _Lilionarcissus
        Hemerocallidis facie_, and, as hee saith, Iacobus Plateau (who
        first sent him the figure hereof, with the description) called
        it _Lilionarcissus Orientalis_, but Clusius vpon certaine
        information, that it grew in the places aforesaid, misliked
        the name of _Orientalis_, and added _Hemerocallis_, which yet
        is not fit, for that his _Hemerocallis Valentina_, is a plaine
        Pancration or Sea bastard Daffodill, whose middle cup is longer
        then the cup of any true Daffodill, which (as I said in the
        beginning of this Chapter) is the chiefest note of difference,
        betweene a true and a bastard Daffodill. I receiued the seede
        of this Daffodill among many other seedes of rare plants, from
        the liberality of Mʳ. Doctor Flud, one of the Physitians of the
        Colledge in London, who gathered them in the Vniuersity Garden
        at Pisa in Italy, and brought them with him, returning home
        from his trauailes into those parts, by the name of _Martagon
        rarissimum_, (and hauing sowne them, expected fourteene yeares,
        before I saw them beare a flower, which the first yeare that it
        did flower, bore foure stalkes of flowers, with euery one of
        them eight or ten flowers on them) which of all other names,
        doth least answer the forme or qualities of this plant. It may
        most fitly be called _Narcissus marinus maximus_, in English,
        The great Sea Daffodill, both because it is a true Daffodill,
        and the greatest of all other, and also because it hath not
        been found, but in Islands, or else in other places neare the
        Sea. Lobelius entituleth it _Pancratium Indicum alterum vernum,
        siue Narcissus Indicus alter facie Pancratij Monspeliaci_, but
        all this is wide from the matter, as may easily be known, by
        that that hath been said before. It is generally (as I said
        before) called of all _Narcissus tertius Matthioli_, Matthiolus
        his third Daffodill, which may either so passe with vs, or as
        I called it, The great Sea Daffodill, which you will, & so
        Clusius doth lastly entitle it.

]


1. _Pancratium Indicum, aut Narcissus Indicus Autumnalis quorundam
Lobelij._   The Indian Autumne Daffodill of Lobel.

This plant hath in my opinion, a farre nearer resemblance vnto an
Hyacinthus, then vnto any Daffodill: But because Lobel hath so set it
forth, I will so publish it vnto you, leauing it to iudgement. The
roote is, as he saith, a span long, and of the thicknesse of a mans
arme, couered with many white shells, whereof the outermost are of a
darke red or Chestnut colour: the flowers rise vp in September and
October, being eight or ten in number, euery one by it selfe vpon a
small footstalke, made of six leaues a peece, somewhat long, narrow,
and pointed, like vnto the flowers of the English Colchicum, or Medowe
Saffron, of a whitish yellow dunne colour, with six long threads in the
middle: the greene leaues are long and broad, and broad pointed.


2. _Narcissus Marinus Africanus, siue Exoticus Lobelij._
The Sea Daffodill of Africa.

The roote of this strange plant (which of some likenesse is called
a Daffodill) is very great, made as it were of many scaly cloues,
from whence riseth vp a small short stalke, bearing hard aboue the
ground two faire broad greene pointed leaues, more long then broad, so
compassing the stalke at the bottome, that it seemeth to run through
them: the stalke is spotted with diuers discoloured spots, and is bare
or naked from these two leaues vnto the toppe, where it beareth one
faire double flower, like vnto a double Anemone, of a delayed reddish
colour, tending to a blush, with many threads set about the middle head.


3. _Narcissus Marinus Exoticus._   The strange Sea Daffodill.

The strange Sea Daffodill, hath fiue or six large and long leaues of
a pale greene colour, from among which riseth vp a strong and bigge
stalke, bearing at the toppe, out of a thinne hose or skinne, many very
large flowers, made of six long and pointed leaues apeece, of a blewish
purple colour, with a large round open cup in the middle, of a sadder
colour then the leaues: the roote is very great, yet like vnto other
great Daffodils, the outer skins whereof are of a darke browne colour.


        The Place.

        The Indian Daffodils grew in the vpper part of Hispaniola in
        the West Indies, and brought hither, where they all soone
        perished.

        The other grew neare the Cape of good Hope, and was brought
        into the parts of Holland and thereabouts, from whence we had
        it, & perished also.

        The last is vnknowne where it was gathered.


        The Time.

        The first flowred in Autumne, as it is said.

        The other in the first Summer of their bringing.

        And so did the last, but the same rootes will not flower with
        vs againe.


        The Names.

        So much hath been said of their names in their titles, as hath
        come to our knowledge; and therefore let that suffice.


Thus hauing gone through the whole Family of the true Daffodils, (for
so much as hath come to our knowledge) and set them downe euery one by
his name, and in this order; it is fit that we speake of their bastard
brethern, and shew you them also, in the same order held with the
former, as neare as the plenty of variety herein, which is not the like
with the former, will giue leaue, that when you know them both by face
and name, you may the better know to place or distinguish of others,
that haue not passed vnder this rod.


_Pseudonarcissus aureus Hispanicus maximus._
The great yellow Spanish bastard Daffodill.

The roote of this kinde of Daffodill is reasonable great, and blackish
on the outside, desiring to be deepe in the ground; and therefore
will runne downe, where it will then encrease into many of-sets, from
whence rise vp many thicke, long, and stiffe leaues, of a grayish
greene colour, among which riseth vp a round strong stalke, sometimes
three foote high or better, bearing at the toppe one onely faire great
yellow flower, standing forth right, and not pendulous, consisting of
six short and somewhat broad leaues, with a very great, large, and long
trunke, of an equall largenesse, but open at the mouth, and turning vp
the brimmes a little, which are somewhat crumpled: after the flower is
past, there commeth in the place a three square head, containing round,
blacke seede, like vnto other Daffodils.


_Pseudonarcissus Pyrenæus Hispanico & Anglico similis._
The Mountaine bastard Daffodill of diuers kindes.

There is much variety in this kinde of bastard Daffodill: For one
sort hath verie broad and whitish greene leaues, somewhat short in
comparison of others, that are of that breadth: the flower is wholly
yellow, but a little paler then the former Spanish kinde, hauing the
leaues of his flower long, and somewhat narrow, standing like wings
about the middle trunke, which is as long as the leaues, and smaller
then in many other of this kinde, but a little yellower then the wings.
Another sort hath narrower green leaues then this last, and longer, the
flower is all yellow, but the trunke is larger, wider, and more open at
the mouth then the former, and almost as large as the former Spanish,
but not so high as the last. A third hath the wings of the flower of a
Strawe colour, but the trunke is long and narrow, of a faire yellow. A
fourth hath such like flowers, but that it is shorter, both the wings
and the trunke: Some likewise haue the wings of the flower longer, then
the long trunke, and some shorter. Some also are all yellow, and some
haue their wings onely a little more pale or white, like the English
kinde: Some againe haue their trunkes long and narrow, others haue
them larger and wider open, and crumpled at the brimmes; so that it is
needlesse, to spend a great deale of time and labour vpon such smally
respected flowers, but that in the beholding of them, we may therein
admire the worke of the Creatour, who can frame such diuersity in one
thing: But this is beside the text, yet not impertinent.


_Pseudonarcissus pallidus præcox._
The early Strawe coloured bastard Daffodill.

The leaues of this Daffodill are of a meane size, betweene the broadest
and the narrower kindes, of a grayish greene colour, and not very long:
the stalke riseth vp a foot high or more, whereon standeth one large
great flower, equalling the greatest Spanish bastard Daffodill, before
described, in the largenesse of his trunke, and hauing the brimmes
turned vp a little, which maketh it seeme the larger: the wings or
outer leaues are in a manner as short, as they are in the greatest
Spanish kinde, (and not long flagging down, like vnto the Mountain
kinds) and stand straight outright: all the whole flower is of one
euen colour, that is, of a fine pale yellow, somewhat like vnto the
colour of a Lemon peele or rinde, but somewhat whiter, which vsually we
call a Strawe colour; the greatnesse of the flower, the earlinesse of
the flowring, and the difference of colour from all the rest of this
kinde, hath made me entreate of it apart by it selfe, as being no lesse
worthy.


_Pseudonarcissus Hispanicus flore albo maior._
The great white Spanish bastard Daffodill.

This bastard Daffodill hath diuers leaues rising vp together, long
and broad, somewhat like vnto the first Spanish kinde, but a little
broader, and of a whiter greene colour, yet not so white, as in the
lesser Spanish white kindes, hereafter described: among these leaues
riseth vp a round strong stalke, about two foote high, bearing one
white flower at the toppe, bending downe the head, as all these white
kindes doe, but is not of so pure a white, as the lesser kindes that
follow, yet whiter then the greatest white Spanish kinde, next of all
to be described: the whole flower, as well trunke as wings, is much
larger then the lesser white kindes, and almost equalling the first
Spanish yellow, but a little longer and narrower, a little crumpled
and turning vp at the brimmes: the head and seede are like the first;
the roote is greater and thicker then the first Spanish, and doth not
encrease so much, nor is couered with a blacke, but rather with a
whitish coate.


_Pseudonarcissus Hispanicus maximus albidus._
The greatest Spanish white bastard Daffodill.

This kinde of bastard Daffodill is very like the last mentioned
Daffodill, both in leaues and flowers, but larger in both: the flower
of this is not full so white, but hath some shew of palenesse therein,
and more vpon the first opening of the flower then afterwards, and is
as great altogether, as the great Spanish yellow, at the least with
a longer, and somewhat narrower trunke: the seede is like vnto the
former, and so is the roote also, but greater, being white on the
outside, and not blacke.


_Pseudonarcissus Hispanicus flore albo medius & minor._
The two lesser white Spanish bastard Daffodils.

There are two other of these kindes of white Spanish Daffodils, one
greater or lesser then the other, but neither of them so great as the
former. The leaues of both are of a whitish greene colour, one a little
broader then the other: the flowers of both are pure white, and bending
downe the heads, that they almost touch the stalke againe, the greater
flower hath the longer and narrower trunke; and the lesser flower, the
shorter and wider open, yet both a little crumpled at the edges or
brimmes: the rootes of both are like one vnto another, but differ in
the greatnesse. From the seede of these haue sprung much variety, few
or none keeping either colour or height with the mother plants.


_Pseudonarcissus Anglicus vulgaris._
Our common English wilde bastard Daffodill.

This bastard Daffodill is so common in all England, both in Copses,
Woods, and Orchards, that I might well forbeare the description
thereof, and especially, in that growing wilde, it is of little respect
in our Garden: but yet, lest I bee challenged of ignorance in common
plants, and in regard of some variety therein worth the marking. I will
set downe his description and variety as briefly as I may: It hath
three or foure grayish greene leaues, long and somewhat narrow, among
which riseth vp the stalke, about a span high or little higher, bearing
at the toppe, out of a skinnie huske, as all other Daffodils haue, one
flower (although sometimes I haue seene two together) somewhat large,
hauing the six leaues that stand like wings, of a pale yellow colour,
and the long trunke in the middle of a faire yellow, with the edges
or brimmes a little crumpled or vneuen: after the flower is past, it
beareth a round head, seeming three square, containing round blacke
seede; the roote is somewhat blackish on the outside.

But there is another of this kinde like vnto the former, whose further
description you haue here before; the wings of which flower are much
more white then the former, and in a manner of a milke white colour,
the trunke remaining almost as yellow as the former, and not differing
in any thing else.

_Pseudonarcissus tubo sexangulari._
The six cornered bastard Daffodill.

This kinde of Daffodill hath two or three long, and somewhat broader
leaues then the last, between which commeth forth a stalke, bearing
one flower somewhat large hauing the six outer leaues of a pale yellow
colour, and the long trunke plaited or cornered all along vnto the very
edge into six parts, of a little deeper yellow then the wings.


        The Place.

        The first great Spanish kinde was brought out of Spaine. The
        rest from the Pyrenæan Mountaines, onely the last sauing one
        is plentifull in our owne Country, but the white sort of that
        kinde came with the rest from the same Mountaines.

        earlier, then the other greater or lesser white.


        The Names.

        Their seuerall names are expressed in their titles sufficient
        to distinguish them, and therefore there needeth no more to be
        said of them.


1. _Pseudonarcissus aureus maximus flore pleno, siue Roseus
Tradescanti._
The greatest double yellow bastard Daffodill, or Iohn Tradescant his
great Rose Daffodill.

This Prince of Daffodils (belongeth primarily to Iohn Tradescant, as
the first founder thereof, that we know, and may well bee entituled
the Glory of Daffodils) hath a great round roote, like vnto other
Daffodils, couered with a brownish outer skinne or peeling, from
whence riseth vp foure or fiue somewhat large and broad leaues, of a
grayish greene colour, yet not fully so long and large as the next
following Daffodill: from the middle whereof riseth vp a stalke almost
as high and great as it, bearing at the toppe (out of a skinnie huske)
one faire large great flower (the budde, before it breake open,
being shorter and thicker in the middle, and ending in a longer and
sharper point then any of the other Daffodils) very much spread open,
consisting of smaller and shorter leaues then the next, but more in
number, and thicker and rounder set together, making it seeme as great
and double as any Prouince Rose, and intermixt with diuers yellow and
pale leaues, as it were on rowes one vnder another. It abideth long in
flower, and spreadeth, by standing long, to be the broadest in compasse
of any of the Daffodils, but falleth away at the last without giuing
any seede, as all double Daffodils doe.


2. _Pseudonarcissus aureus Anglicus maximus._
Mʳ. Wilmers great double Daffodill.

The other great double Daffodill doth so neare resemble our ordinary
English double kinde, that I doe not finde therein any greater
difference, then the largenesse both of leaues and flowers, &c., and
the statelinesse of growth. It beareth three or foure large, long,
and broad leaues, somewhat longer and broader then the former, and
of a whitish greene colour: the stalke riseth to bee two foote high,
growing (in a fruitfull and fat soyle) strong, and somewhat round,
bearing at the toppe, out of a thin skinne, one great and faire double
flower, each leafe whereof is twice as large and broad as the former,
diuersly intermixt with a rowe of paler, and a rowe of deeper yellow
leaues, wholly dispersed throughout the flower, the pale colour as well
as the deeper yellow, in this as in the other small English kinde,
growing deeper by standing: sometimes the leaues hereof are scattered,
and spread wholly, making it shew a faire, broad, open flower: and
sometimes the outer leaues stand separate from the middle trunke,
which is whole and vnbroken, and very thicke of leaues: and sometimes
the middle trunke, will bee halfe broken, neither expressing a full
open double flower, nor a close double trunke, as it is likewise seene
in the small English kinde, as shall bee declared in his place: this
beareth no seede; the roote hereof is thicke and great, and encreaseth
as well as any other Daffodill.


3. _Pseudonarcissus aureas Hispanicus flore pleno._
The great double yellow Spanish bastard Daffodill, or Parkinsons
Daffodill.

This double Spanish Daffodill hath diuers leaues rising from the
roote, stiffer, narrower, and not of so whitish a greene colour as the
former, but more sullen or grayish, plainely resembling the leaues of
the single great kinde, from whence this hath risen: the stalke hereof
likewise riseth almost as high as it, and neare the height of the
last recited double, bearing one double flower at the toppe, alwayes
spread open, and neuer forming a double trunke like the former, yet
not so faire and large as it, the outermost leaues whereof being of a
greenish colour at the first, and afterward more yellow, doe a little
turne themselues backe againe to the stalke, the other leaues are some
of a pale yellow, and others of a more gold yellow colour, those that
stand in the middle are smaller, and some of them shew as if they were
hollow trunked, so that they seeme to be greenish, whitish, yellow, and
gold yellow, all mixed one among another: the root is great, round, and
whitish on the inside, couered with darke coloured skinnes or peelings.
I thinke none euer had this kinde before my selfe, nor did I my selfe
euer see it before the yeare 1618, for it is of mine own raising and
flowring first in my Garden.


4. _Pseudonarcissus Gallicus maior flore pleno._
The greater double French bastard Daffodill.

This greater double Daffodill, hath his whitish greene leaues longer
and broader then the smaller French kinde, hereafter following, to bee
described, and broader, longer, and more limber then the double English
kinde: the stalke riseth vp not much higher, then the smaller French
kinde, but a little bigger, bearing at the top one great double flower,
which when it is fully and perfectly blowne open (which is but seldome;
for that it is very tender, the leaues being much thinner, and thereby
continually subiect, vpon any little distemperature of the time, to
cleaue so fast one vnto another, that the flower cannot blow open
faire) is a faire and goodly flower, larger by halfe then the smaller
kinde, and fuller of leaues, of the same pale whitish yellow, or Lemon
colour, with the lesser, or rather a little whiter, and not set in the
same order of rowes as it is, but more confusedly together, and turning
backe the ends of the outermost leaues to the stalke againe, and hauing
the bottome of the flower on the backside somewhat greene, neither of
which is found in the lesser kinde: the roote is very like vnto the
lesser kinde, but a little bigger and longer.


5. _Pseudonarcissus Anglicus flore pleno._
The double English bastard Daffodill, or Gerrards double Daffodill.

The leaues of this double Daffodill are very like vnto the single
kinde, being of a whitish greene colour, and somewhat broad, a little
shorter and narrower, yet stiffer then the former French kinde: the
stalke riseth vp about a foote high, bearing at the toppe one very
double flower, the outermost leaues being of the same pale colour, that
is to bee seene in the wings of the single kinde; those that stand next
them are some as deepe a yellow as the trunke of the single, and others
of the same pale colour, with some greene stripes on the backe of
diuers of the leaues: thus is the whole flower variably intermixt with
pale and deepe yellow, and some greene stripes among them, when it
is fully open, and the leaues dispersed and broken. For sometimes the
flower sheweth a close and round yellow trunke in the middle, separate
from the pale outer wings, which trunke is very double, shewing some
pale leaues within it, dispersed among the yellow: And sometimes the
trunke is more open, or in part broken, shewing forth the same colours
intermixt within it: the flower passeth away without giuing any seede,
as all other bulbous rootes doe that beare double flowers: the roote is
small, very like vnto the French double kindes, especially the lesser,
that it is verie hard to know the one from the other.


        The Place.

        The first and greatest kinde, we had first from Iohn
        Tradescante (as I said before) whether raised from seed, or
        gained from beyond Sea, I know not.

        The second we first had from Vincent Sion, borne in Flanders,
        dwelling on the Bank side, in his liues time, but now dead; an
        industrious and worthy louer of faire flowers, who cherished it
        in his Garden for many yeares, without bearing of any flowers
        vntill the yeare 1620, that hauing flowred with him, (and hee
        not knowing of whom hee receiued it, nor hauing euer seene the
        like flower before) he sheweth it to Mʳ. Iohn de Franqueuille,
        of whom he supposed he had receiued it, (for from beyond Sea
        he neuer receiued any) who finding it to bee a kinde neuer
        seene or knowne to vs before, caused him to respect it the
        more, as it is well worthy. And Mʳ. George Wilmer of Stratford
        Bowe Esquire, in his liues time hauing likewise receiued it
        of him (as my selfe did also) would needes appropriate it to
        himselfe, as if he were the first founder thereof, and call it
        by his owne name Wilmers double Daffodill, which since hath so
        continued.

        The third is of mine owne fostering or raising, as I said
        before; for assuredly, it is risen from the seede of the great
        Spanish single kinde, which I sowed in mine owne Garden, and
        cherished it, vntill it gaue such a flower as is described.

        The fourth is not certainly knowne where his originall should
        be: Some thinke it to be of France, and others of Germany.

        The last is assuredly first naturall of our owne Countrey, for
        Mʳ. Gerrard first discouered it to the world, finding it in
        a poore womans Garden in the West parts of England, where it
        grew before the woman came to dwell there, and, as I haue heard
        since, is naturall of the Isle of Wight.


        The Time.

        They doe all flower much about one time, that is, from the
        middle or end of March, as the yeare is forward, vnto the
        middle of Aprill.


        The Names.

        Vpon the three first I haue imposed the names in Latine, as
        they are expressed in their titles: and for the English names,
        if you please, you may let them passe likewise as they are
        expressed there also, that thereby euery one may be truely
        distinguished, and not confounded. The fourth, besides the name
        in the title, is called of some _Narcissus Germanicus_, which
        whether it be of Germany, or no, I know not; but that the name
        should import so much. The last doth vsually carry Mʳ. Gerrards
        name, and called Gerrards double Daffodill.


1. _Pseudonarcissus angustifolius flore flauescente tubo quasi
abscisso._
The narrow leafed bastard Daffodill with the clipt trunke.

This kinde of Daffodill hath long and narrow grayish greene leaues,
bearing one single flower at the toppe of his stalke, like vnto the
former single bastard kindes, before specified, hauing his outer
leaues of a pale yellow colour, and his trunke of a deeper yellow: the
chiefe differences in this from the former, is in the leaues, being
narrow, and then in the trunke of the flower, which is not crumpled or
turned vp, as most of the other are; and that the brimmes or edges of
the flower is as if it had been clipt off, or cut euen.


2. _Pseudonarcissus Hispanicus medius & minor luteus._
The two lesser Spanish yellow bastard Daffodils.

These two lesser kindes of Spanish Daffodils, doe but differ in
greatnesse the one from the other, and not in any thing else; so that
in declaring the one, you may vnderstand the other to bee a little
greater. The lesser hath three or foure narrow short whitish greene
leaues, from among which commeth forth a short stalke, not aboue an
hand breadth, or halfe a foote high, bearing one single flower, not
fully standing outright, but a little bending downe, consisting of
six small leaues, standing as wings about a small, but long trunke, a
little crumpled at the brimmes: the whole flower, as well leaues as
trunke, are of one deepe yellow colour, like vnto the great Spanish
kinde: the roote is but small, and couered with a darkish coate. The
other is in all parts greater, and (as I said) differeth not else.


3. _Pseudonarcissus Hispanicus luteus minimus._
The least Spanish yellow bastard Daffodill.

The leaues of this small kinde are smaller and shorter then the former,
seldome exceeding the length of three inches, and very narrow withall,
but of the same grayish greene colour with the former: euery flower
standeth vpon a small and short footestalke, scarce rising aboue the
ground; so that his nose, for the most part, doth lye or touch the
ground, and is made after the same fashion, and of the same colour with
the former, but much smaller, as his roote is so likewise.


4. _Pseudonarcissus Gallicus minor flore pleno._
The lesser French double bastard Daffodill.

The rootes of this lesser French kinde (if I may lawfully call it, or
the greater kinde before specified, a bastard Daffodill; for I somewhat
doubt thereof, in that the flower of either is not made after the
fashion of any of the other bastard Daffodils, but doth more nearely
resemble the forme of the double white Daffodill, expressed before
among the true Daffodils) are like vnto the double English kinde, as
also to the former double great French kinde, and the leaues are of
the same whitish greene colour also, but narrower and not longer: the
stalke riseth a little higher then the English, and not fully so high
as the greater French, bearing one faire double flower thereon, of a
pale yellow or Lemon colour, consisting of six rowes of leaues, euery
rowe growing smaller then other vnto the middle, and so set and placed,
that euery leafe of the flower doth stand directly almost in all, one
vpon or before another vnto the middle, where the leaues are smallest,
the outermost being the greatest, which maketh the flower seeme the
more beautifull: this and the greater kinde hath no trunke, or shew
of any other thing in the middle, as all or most of the other former
double bastard Daffodils haue, but are flowers wholly composed of
leaues, standing double euen to the middle.


        The Place.

        The first is vndoubtedly a naturall of the Pyrenæan Mountaines.

        The Spanish kindes grew in Spaine, and

        The French double kinde about Orleance in France, where it is
        said to grow plentifully.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth at the end of March.

        The Spanish kindes are the most early, flowring betimes in
        March.

        The French double doth flower presently after.


        The Names.

        More cannot bee said or added, concerning the names of any of
        these Daffodils, then hath been set downe in their titles:
        onely the French kinde is most vsually called Robinus his
        Daffodill.


_Pseudonarcissus Iuncifolius albus._
The white bastard Rush Daffodill, or Iunquilia.

This bastard Rush Daffodill hath two or three long and very greene
leaues, very like vnto the small yellow Rush Daffodill, formerly
described, but not altogether so round, among which riseth vp a short
stalke, seldome halfe a foote high, bearing at the toppe, out of a
small skinnie huske, one small white flower, sometime declining to
a pale colour, hauing six small and short leaues, standing about
the middle of the trunke, which is long, and much wider open at the
mouth, then at the bottome: the small outer leaues or wings are a
little tending to greene, and the trunke (as I said) is either white,
or whitish, hauing the brimmes a little vneuen: the seede is small,
blacke, and round, like vnto other Rush Daffodils, but smaller.


_Pseudonarcissus Iuncifolia, luteus maior._
The greater yellow Iunquilia, or bastard Daffodill.

The leaues of this greater kinde are longer, greater, and a little
broader then the former; the stalke also is higher, and the flower
larger, more open at the mouth and crumpled, then the white, but wholly
of a yellow colour: the seede and the roots are bigger, according to
the proportion of the plant.


_Pseudonarcissus Iuncifolius luteus minor._
The lesser yellow bastard Iunquilia.

This is so like vnto the last in all things, that I shall not neede to
trouble you with repetitions of the same things formerly spoken; the
chiefest difference is the smallnesse of the plant in all parts.


_Pseudonarcissus Iuncifolius luteus serotinus._
The late yellow bastard Iunquilia.

There is likewise a third kinde, as great as the greater yellow, and in
all his parts expressing and equalling it, but is accounted the fairer,
and flowreth somewhat later.


        The Place.

        The Pyrenæan Hils haue afforded vs all these varieties, and wee
        preserue them carefully; for they are all tender.


        The Time.

        All these flower in Aprill, except the last, which is a moneth
        later.


        The Names.

        The French and Lowe-Countrey men call them _Trompettes_, that
        is, Trumpets, from the forme of the trunke; wee sometimes call
        them also by that name, but more vsually bastard Iunquilia’s.

_Pseudonarcissus marinus albus, Pancratium vulgo._
The white Sea bastard Daffodill.

The Sea bastard Daffodill (to conclude this Chapter, and the discourse
of Daffodils) hath diuers broad whitish greene leaues, but not very
long, among which riseth vp a stiffe round stalke, at the top whereof
breaketh out of a great round skinny huske, fiue or six flowers, euery
one made somewhat of the fashion of the great bastard Rush Daffodill,
but greater, and wholly white; the six leaues, being larger and longer
then in the Rush kinde, and extending beyond the trunke, are tipt with
greene at the point of each leafe, and downe the middle likewise on the
backside. The trunke is longer, larger, and wider open at the mouth,
cut in or indented at the brims or edges, and small at the bottome,
with diuers white threeds in the middle, and is very sweet: vnder the
flower is a round greene head, which groweth very great, hauing within
it, when it is ripe, flat and blacke seede: the roote is great and
white.

[Sidenote: _Flore luteo, & flore rubro._]

It is reported, that there are found other sorts; some that beare
yellow flowers, and others that beare red: but we haue seene none such,
and therefore I can say no more of them.


        The Place.

        This kinde groweth neare the Sea side, both in Spaine, Italy,
        and France, within the Straights, and for the most part, vpon
        all the Leuant shoare and Islands also, but will seldome either
        flower, or abide with vs in these colder Countries, as I haue
        both seene by those that I receiued from a friend, and heard by
        others.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in the end of Summer, that is, in August and
        September.


        The Name.

        Diuers doe call it _Pancratium_, as the learned of Mompeher,
        and others, with the addition of _flore Lilij_, after they had
        left their old errour, in taking it to be _Scylla_, and vsing
        it for _Scylla_, in the _Trochisces_ that go into Andromachus
        Treakle. The learned of Valentia in Spaine, as Clusius saith,
        doe call it _Hemerocallis_, thinking it to be a Lilly; and
        Clusius doth thereupon call it, _Hemerocallis Valentina_: but
        in my opinion, all these are deceiued in this plant; for it
        is neither a Lilly, to haue the name of _Hemerocallis_ giuen
        vnto it, nor _Scylla_, nor _Pancratium_, as many doe yet call
        it: for certainly this is a kinde of Daffodill; the forme both
        of roote, leafe, and flower, doth assure me that haue seene
        it, and not _Pancratium_, which (as Dioscorides testifieth) is
        a kinde of _Scylla_, and in his time called _Scylla_, with a
        red roote, and a leafe like a Lilly, but longer, and was vsed
        both with the same preparation and quantity, and for the same
        diseases that _Scylla_ was vsed, but that his force was weaker:
        all which doth plainly shew the errours that many learned men
        haue been conuersant in, and that all may see how necessary the
        knowledge of Herbarisme is to the practice of Physicke; And
        lest the roote of this Sea bastard Daffodill bee vsed in the
        stead of an wholesome remedy, which (as Clusius maketh mention)
        was deadly to him that did but cut his meate with that knife,
        which had immediately before cut this roote, and done in malice
        by him, that knew the force thereof, to kill his fellow, it
        working the more forceably by the euill attracting quality of
        the iron.


        The Vertues of Daffodils in generall.

        Howsoeuer Dioscorides and others, doe giue vnto some of them
        speciall properties, both for inward and outward diseases, yet
        know I not any in these dayes with vs, that apply any of them
        as a remedy for any griefe, whatsoeuer Gerrard or others haue
        written.




CHAP. X.

_Leucoium bulbosum._   The bulbous Violet.


Hauing thus set downe the whole family, both of the true and bastard
Daffodils, I should next set in hand with the Hyacinths; but because
_Leucoium bulbosum_, The bulbous Violet is a plant that doth challenge
a place next vnto the Daffodils, as most nearly partaking with them,
and a little with the Hyacinthes, I must of necessity interpose them,
and shew their descriptions and differences, whereof some are early, of
the first Spring, others later, and some of the Autumne.


_Leucoium bulbosum præcox maius._   The greater early bulbous Violet.

This bulbous Violet hath three or foure very greene, broad, flat, and
short leaues, among which riseth vp a naked greene stalke, bearing
out of a small skinny hose (as the former Daffodils doe) one white
flower, hanging downe his head by a very small foot-stalke, made of six
leaues, of an equall length, euery one whereof is tipt at the end with
a small greenish yellow spot: after the flower is past, the head or
seed-vessell groweth to be reasonable great, somewhat long and round,
wherein is contained hard round seede, which being dry, is cleare, and
of a whitish yellow colour: the roote is somewhat like a Daffodill
roote, and couered with a blackish outside or skinne.


_Leucoium bulbosum præcox minus._   The lesser early bulbous Violet.

This lesser kinde riseth vp with two narrow grayish greene leaues,
between which commeth forth the stalke, fiue or six inches high,
bearing one small pendulous flower, consisting of three white leaues,
which are small and pointed, standing on the outside, and hauing three
other shorter leaues, which seeme like a cup in the middle, being each
of them round at the ends, and cut in the middle, making the forme of
an heart, with a greene tippe or spot at the broad end or edge: the
seede is whitish, inclosed in long and round heads, like the former,
but lesser: the roote is like a small Daffodill, with a blackish gray
coate, and quickly diuideth into many of-sets.

[Sidenote: _Minus Byzantinum._]

There is another of this kinde, that came among other bulbous rootes
from Constantinople, and differeth in nothing from it, but that it is a
little greater, both in root, leafe, and flower.


        The Place.

        The two first are found in many places of Germany, and Hungary.
        The third, as I said, was brought from Constantinople.


        The Time.

        The two lesser sorts doe most commonly flower in February,
        if the weather be any thing milde, or at the furthest in the
        beginning of March, but the first is seldome in flower, before
        the other be well neare past, or altogether.


        The Names.

        Lobel and Dodonæus call the lesser kinde _Leucoium triphyllum_,
        and _Leuconarcissolirion triphyllum_, of the three leaues in
        the flower. Some doe call it _Viola bulbosa alba_. The first
        or greater kinde is called by Lobel, _Leuconarcissolirion
        paucioribus floribus_; and by Dodonæus, _Leucoium bulbosum
        hexaphyllum_. We doe most vsually call them, _Leucoium
        bulbosum præcox maius_, & _minus_, The greater, or the lesser
        early bulbous Violet. In Dutch, _Somer Sottekens_, and not
        _Druiskens_, which are Grape-flowers, as some haue thought.


1. _Leucoium bulbosum Vernum minimum._
The small bulbous Violet of the Spring.

This small _Leucoium_ sendeth forth his small and long greene leaues,
like haires in Autumne, and before Winter, which abide greene vntill
Aprill, and then wither away quite, and about May there ariseth vp
a naked slender stalke, at the toppe whereof breake forth two small
white flowers, made of six leaues a peece, hanging downe their heads,
the three inner leaues being a little larger then the three outward, a
little reddish neare the stalke, and very sweete: the root is small and
round, and couered with a darke coate.


2. _Leucoium bulbosum Autumnale._   The small Autumne bulbous Violet.

As the former small _Leucoium_ sprang vp with his leaues without
flowers in Autumne, so this contrariwise, riseth vp with his slender
brownish stalke of flowers in Autumne, before any greene leaues
appeare, whereon stand two or three very small snow white pendulous
flowers, consisting of six leaues a peece, and a little reddish at the
bottome of the flower next vnto the stalke, so like vnto the former,
that one would take them to be both one: after which, there grow small
browne heads, containing small, blacke, round seed; after the flower
is past, and the seede is ripening, and sometimes after the heads are
ripe, the leaues begin to spring vp, which when they are full growne,
are long, greene, and as small, or smaller then the leaues of the
Autumne Hyacinth, which abide all the Winter, and Spring following, and
wither away in the beginning of Summer: the roote is small, long, and
white.


3. _Leucoium maius bulbosum serotinum._
The great late flowring bulbous Violet.

The late bulbous Violet hath three or foure broad flat greene leaues,
very like vnto the first, but longer, among which riseth vp a flattish
stalke, being thicker in the middle then at both edges, on the toppe
whereof stand three or foure flowers, hanging downe their heads,
consisting of six leaues a peece, all of an equall length and bignesse,
wholly white, except that each leafe hath a greene tippe at the end of
them: the seede hereof is blacke and round; the roote is reasonable
great and white.


        The Place.

        The two former small ones were first found in Spaine, and
        Portugall, and sent to me by Guillaume Boel; but the first
        was so tender, that scarce one of a score sprang with me, or
        would abide. The greatest haue beene found wilde in Germany and
        Austria.


        The Time.

        The small ones haue their times expressed in their titles and
        descriptions, the last flowreth not vntill May.


        The Names.

        These names that are set downe in their titles, doe passe with
        all Herbarists in these daies.


        The Vertues.

        Wee haue not knowne these plants vsed Physically, either
        inwardly or outwardly, to any purposes in these dayes.




CHAP. XI.

_Hyacinthus._   The Hyacinth or Iacinth.


The Iacinths are next to be entreated of, whereof there are many more
kindes found out in these later times, then formerly were knowne,
which for order and method sake, I will digest vnder seuerall sorts,
as neare as I can, that auoiding confusion, by enterlacing one among
another, I may the better put euery sort vnder his owne kinde.


_Hyacinthus Indicus maior tuberosa radice._
The greater Indian knobbed Iacinth.

I haue thought fittest to begin with this Iacinth, both because it is
the greatest and highest, and also because the flowers hereof are in
some likenesse neare vnto a Daffodill, although his roote be tuberous,
and not bulbous as all the rest are. This Indian Iacinth hath a
thicke knobbed roote (yet formed into seuerall heads, somewhat like
vnto bulbous rootes) with many thicke fibres at the bottome of them;
from the diuers heads of this roote arise diuers strong and very tall
stalkes, beset with diuers faire, long, and broad leaues, ioyned at
the bottome close vnto the stalke, where they are greatest, and grow
smaller to the very end, and those that grow higher to the toppe, being
smaller and smaller, which being broken, there appeare many threeds
like wooll in them: the toppes of the stalkes are garnished with many
faire large white flowers, each whereof is composed of six leaues,
lying spread open, as the flowers of the white Daffodill, with some
short threeds in the middle, and of a very sweete sent, or rather
strong and headie.


_Hyacinthus Indicus minor tuberosa radice._
The smaller Indian knobbed Iacinth.

The roote of this Iacinth is knobbed, like the roote of Arum or Wake
Robin, from whence doe spring many leaues, lying vpon the ground,
and compassing one another at the bottome, being long and narrow,
and hollow guttered to the end, which is small and pointed, no lesse
woolly, or full of threeds then the former: from the middle of these
leaues riseth vp the stalke, being very long and slender, three or
foure foot long, so that without it be propped vp, it will bend
downe, and lye vpon the ground, whereon are set at certaine distances
many short leaues, being broad at the bottome, where they doe almost
compasse the stalke, and are smaller toward the end where it is sharpe
pointed: at the top of the stalke stand many flowers, with a small
peece of a green leafe at the bottome of euery foot-stalke, which seeme
to bee like so many white Orientall Iacinths, being composed of six
leaues, which are much thicker then the former, with six chiues or
threeds in the middle, tipt with pale yellow pendents.


        The Place.

        They both grow naturally in the West Indies, from whence being
        first brought into Spaine, haue from thence been dispersed vnto
        diuers louers of plants.


        The Time.

        They flower not in these cold Countries vntill the middle of
        August, or not at all, if they bee not carefully preserued
        from the iniury of our cold Winters; and then if the precedent
        Summer be hot, it may be flower a moneth sooner.


        The Names.

        Clusius calleth the lesser (for I thinke hee neuer saw the
        first) _Hyacinthus Indicus tuberosa radice_, that is in
        English, The Indian Iacinth with a tuberous roote: Some would
        call these _Hyacinthus Eriophorus Indicus_, that is, The Indian
        woolly Iacinth, because they haue much wooll in them when they
        are broken; yet some doe doubt that they are not two plants
        seuerall, as of greater and lesser, but that the greatnesse is
        caused by the fertility of the soyle wherein it grew.


1. _Hyacinthus Botroides maior Moschatus, siue Muscari flore flauo._
The great yellow Muske Grape-flower, or yellow Muscari.

This Muske Iacinth or Grape-flower, hath fiue or six leaues spread
vpon the ground in two or three heads, which at the first budding or
shooting forth out of the ground, are of a reddish purple colour, and
after become long, thicke, hollow, or guttered on the vpper side, of
a whitish greene colour, and round and darke coloured vnderneath: in
the middle of these heads of leaues, rise vp one or two hollow weake
brownish stalkes, sometimes lying on the ground with the weight of the
flowers, (but especially of the seede) yet for the most part standing
vpright, when they are laden towards the toppe, with many bottle-like
flowers, which at their first appearing, and vntill the flowers begin
to blow open, are of a browne red colour, and when they are blowne,
of a faire yellow colour, flowring first below, and so vpwards by
degrees, euery one of these flowers is made like vnto a little pitcher
or bottle, being bigge in the belly, and small at the mouth, which is
round, and a little turned vp, very sweete in smell, like vnto Muske,
whereof it tooke the name _Muscari_; after the flowers are past, there
come three square thicke heads, puffed vp as if it were bladders, made
of a spongie substance, wherein are here and there placed blacke round
seed: the roote is long, round, and very thicke, and white on the
outside, with a little woollinesse on them, being broken, and full of a
slimie iuice, whereunto are annexed thicke, fat, and long fibres, which
perish not as most of the other Iacinths; and therefore desireth not to
bee often remoued, as the other sorts may.


2. _Hyacinthus Botroides maior Moschatus, seu Muscari flore
cineritio._
The Ashcoloured Muske Grape-flower, or Muscari.

This Muscari differeth not in rootes, or forme of leaues or flowers
from the former, the chiefe differences are these: the leaues hereof
do not appeare so red at the first budding out of the ground, nor are
so darke when they are fully growne; the stalke also most vsually hath
more store of flowers thereon, the colour whereof at the first budding
is a little duskie, and when they are full blowne, are of a bleake, yet
bright ash-colour, with a little shew of purple in them, and by long
standing change a little more gray; being as sweete, or as some thinke,
more sweete then the former: the roote (as I said) is like the former,
yet yeeldeth more encrease, and will better endure our cold clymate,
although it doth more seldome giue ripe seede.


3. _Hyacinthus Botroides maior Moschatus, siue Muscari flore rubro._
The red Muske Grape-flower.

This kinde (if there be any such, for I am in some doubt thereof) doth
chiefly differ in the colour of the flower from the first, in that this
should beare flowers when they are blowne, of a red colour tending to
yellownesse.


4. _Hyacinthus Botroides maior Moschatus, siue Muscari flore albo._
The white Muske Grape-flower.

This also is said to haue (if there bee such an one) his leaues like
vnto the second kinde, but of a little whiter greene, and the flowers
pale, tending to a white: the roots of these two last are said vsually
not to grow to be so great as of the former two.

]


        The Place.

        The rootes of the two first sorts, haue been often sent from
        Constantinople, among many other sorts of rootes, and it may
        be come thither from beyond the Bosphorus in Asia; we haue them
        in our Gardens.

        The other two sorts are sprung (it is probable, if they be _in
        rerum natura_) from the seede of the two former; for we could
        neuer get such from Constantinople, as if the Turkes had neuer
        knowledge of any such.


        The Time.

        They flower in March or Aprill, as the yeare is temperate, but
        the first is soonest vp out of the ground.


        The Names.

        The two former haue beene sent from Turkie by the name of
        _Muschoromi_ and _Dipcadi_. Matthiolus calleth it _Bulbus
        vomitorius_, saying that no root doth more prouoke vomit then
        it. Caspar Bauhinus doth most properly call it _Hyacinthus
        Moschatus_. It is most generally called _Muscari_, by all
        Herbarists and Florists, yet because it doth so neerely
        resemble the Grape-flower, I haue named it _Hyacinthus
        Botroides maior Moschatus_, to put a difference from the
        lesser Grape-flowers that follow; in English, The great Muske
        Grape-flower, or Muscari.


_Hyacinthus Botroides minor cæruleus obscurus._
The darke blew Grape-flower.

This Grape-flower hath many small, fat, and weake leaues lying vpon the
ground, which are somewhat brownish at their first comming vp, and of a
sad greene afterwards, hollow on the vpperside, and round vnderneath,
among which rise vp round, smooth, weake stalkes, bearing at the
toppe many small heauie bottle-like flowers, in shape like the former
Muscari, but very thicke thrust together, smaller, and of a very darke
or blackish blew colour, of a very strong smell, like vnto Starch when
it is new made, and hot: the root is round, and blackish without, being
compassed with a number of small rootes, or of-sets round about it, so
that it will quickly choke a ground, if it be suffered long in it. For
which cause, most men doe cast it into some by-corner, if they meane to
preserue it, or cast it out of the Garden quite.

[Sidenote: _Alter maior._]

There is another of this kinde that is greater, both in leafe and
flower, and differeth not in colour or any thing else.


_Hyacinthus Botroides cæruleus amænus._
The skie coloured Grape-flower.

This Iacinth springeth vp with fewer leaues then the first, and not
reddish, but green at his first appearing; the leaues, when they
are full growne, are long and hollow, like the former, but greener,
shorter, and broader, standing vpright, and not lying along vpon the
ground as they doe: the flowers grow at the toppe of the stalke, more
sparsedly set thereon, and not so thicke together, but like a thinne
bunch of grapes, and bottle-like as the former, of a perfect blew or
skie colour, euery flower hauing some white spots about the brimmes
of them: this hath a very sweete smell, nothing like the former: this
roote is whiter, and doth not so much encrease as the former, yet
plentifull enough.


_Hyacinthus Botroides ramosus._   The branched Grape-flower.

Of this kinde, there is another found to grow with many branches
of flowers, breaking out from the sides of the greater stalkes or
branches: the leaues as all the rest of the plant is greater then the
former.


_Hyacinthus Botroides flore albo._   The white Grape-flower.

The white Grape-flower hath his green leaues a little whiter, then the
blew or skie coloured Grape-flower, his flowers are very pure white,
alike sparsedly set on the stalkes, but a little lower and smaller then
it, in all other things there is no difference.


_Hyacinthus Botroides flore albo rubente._   The blush Grape-flower.

The roote of this Grape-flower groweth greater, then either the skie
coloured, or white Grape-flower, and seldome hath any small rootes or
of-sets, as the other haue: his leaues also are larger, and somewhat
broader; the flowers are of a pale, or bleake blush colour out of a
white, and are a little larger, and grow a little higher and fuller of
flowers then the white.


        The Place.

        They naturally grow in many places both of Germany and Hungary;
        in Spaine likewise, and on Mount Baldus in Italy, and Narbone
        in France, about the borders of the fields: we haue them in our
        Gardens for delight.


        The Time.

        These flower from the beginning of March, or sooner sometimes,
        vntill the beginning of May.


        The Names.

        They are most commonly called _Botroides_, but more truely
        _Botryodes_, of Βότρυς the Greeke word, which signifieth a
        bunch or cluster of grapes: Lobelius calleth the white one,
        _Dipcadi flore albo_, transferring the name _Dipcadi_, whereby
        the _Muscari_ is called to this Iacinth, as if they were
        both one. Their seuerall names, whereby they are knowne, and
        called, are set downe in their titles. The Dutchmen call them
        _Driuekens_, as I said before. Some English Gentlewomen call
        the white Grape-flower Pearles of Spaine.


1. _Hyacinthus Comosus albus._   The white haired Iacinth.

This Iacinth doth more neerly resemble the Grape-flowers, then the
faire haired Iacinths that follow, whereof it beareth the name, in
that it hath no haire or threeds at the toppe of the stalke or sides,
as they: and therefore I haue placed it next vnto them, and the other
to follow it, as being of another kinde. The root hereof is blackish,
a little long and round, from whence rise vp three or foure leaues,
being smooth and whitish, long, narrow, and hollow, like a trough or
gutter on the vpperside: among which the stalke riseth vp a foote high
or more, bearing at the toppe diuers small flowers, somewhat like the
former, but not so thicke set together, being a little longer, and
larger, and wider at the mouth, and as it were diuided into six edges,
of a darke whitish colour, with some blacker spots about the brimmes on
the inside: the heads or seede-vessels are three square, and somewhat
larger, then the heads of any of the former lesser Grape-flowers,
wherein is contained round blacke seede.


2. _Hyacinthus Comosus Byzantinus._   The Turkie faire haired Iacinth.

This other Iacinth which came from Constantinople, is somewhat like
the former, but that it is bigger, both in roote, and leafe, and
flower, and bearing greater store of flowers on the head of the
stalke: the lower flowers, although they haue short stalkes at their
first flowring, yet afterwards the stalkes grow longer, and those
that are lower, stand out further then those that are highest, whose
foot-stalkes are short, and almost close to the stemme, and of a more
perfect purple then any below, which are of a duskie greenish purple
colour: the whole stalke of flowers seem like a Pyramis, broad belowe,
and small aboue, or as other compare it, to a water sprinkle; yet
neither of both these Iacinths haue any threeds at the tops of the
stalkes, as the other following haue.


3. _Hyacinthus Comosus maior purpureus._
The great purple faire haired Iacinth.

This faire haired Iacinth hath his leaues softer, longer, broader, and
lesse hollow then the former, lying for the most part vpon the ground:
the stalke riseth vp in the midst of the leaues, being stronger,
higher, and bearing a greater and longer head of flowers also then
they: the flowers of this stand not vpon such long foote-stalkes, but
are shorter below, and close almost to the stalke aboue, hauing many
bright purplish blew threeds, growing highest aboue the flowers, as it
were in a bush together, euery one of these threeds hauing a little
head at the end of them, somewhat like vnto one of the flowers, but
much smaller: the red of the flowers below this bush, are of a sadder
or deader purple, and not so bright a colour, and the lowest worst of
all, rather enclining to a greene, like vnto the last Turkie kinde: the
whole stalke with the flowers vpon it, doth somewhat resemble a long
Purse tassel, and thereupon diuers Gentlewomen haue so named it: the
heads and seede are like vnto the former, but greater: the roote is
great and white with some rednesse on the outside.


4. _Hyacinthus Comosus ramosus purpureus._
The faire haired branched Iacinth.

The leaues of this Iacinth are broader, shorter, and greener then of
the last, not lying so weakly on the ground, but standing somewhat
more vpright: the stalke riseth vp as high as the former, but branched
out on euery side into many tufts of threeds, with knappes, as it were
heads of flowers, at the ends of them, like vnto the head of threeds
at the toppe of the former Iacinth, but of a little darker, and not
so faire a blewish purple colour: this Iacinth doth somewhat resemble
the next Curld haire Iacinth, but that the branches are not so fairely
composed altogether of curled threeds, nor of so excellent a faire
purple or Doue colour, but more duskie by much: the roote is greater
and shorter then of the next, and encreaseth faster.


5. _Hyacinthus Pennatus, siue Comosus ramosus elegantior._
The faire Curld-haire Iacinth.

This admirable Iacinth riseth vp with three or foure leaues, somewhat
like vnto the leaues of the Muske Grape-flower, but lesser; betweene
which riseth vp the stalke about a foote high, or somewhat more,
bearing at the toppe a bush or tuft of flowers, which at the first
appearing, is like vnto a Cone or Pineapple, and afterwards opening
it selfe, spreadeth into many branches, yet still retaining the forme
of a Pyramis, being broad spread below, and narrow vp aboue: each of
these branches is againe diuided into many tufts of threeds or strings,
twisted or curled at the ends, and of an excellent purple or Doue
colour, both stalkes and haires. This abideth a great while in his
beauty, but afterwards all these flowers (if you will so call them)
do fall away without any seede at all, spending it selfe as it should
seeme in the aboundance of the flowers: the roote is not so great as
the last, but white on the outside.


        The Place.

        The two first haue been sent diuers times from Constantinople,
        the third is found wilde in many places of Europe, and as well
        in Germany, as in Italy. The two last are onely with vs in
        Gardens, and their naturall places are not knowne vnto vs.


        The Time.

        The three former kindes doe flower in Aprill, the two last in
        May.


        The Names.

        The first and second haue no other names then are expressed in
        their titles. The third is called of some onely _Hyacinthus
        maior_ and of others _Hyacinthus comosus maior_: We call it in
        English, The purple faire haired Iacinth, because of his tuft
        of purple threeds, like haires at the toppe, and (as I said)
        of diuers Gentlewomen, purple tassels. The fourth is called by
        some as it is in the title, _Hyacinthus Comosus ramosus_, and
        of others _Hyacinthus Calamistratus_. And the last or fifth is
        diuersly called by diuers, Fabius Columna in his _Phytobasanos_
        the second part, calleth it _Hyacinthus Sannesius_, because
        hee first saw it in that Cardinals Garden at Rome. Robin of
        Paris sent to vs the former of the two last, by the name
        of _Hyacinthus Pennatus_, and _Hyacinthus Calamistratus_,
        when as others sent the last by the name _Pennatus_, and the
        other by the name of _Calamistratus_; but I thinke the name
        _Cincinnatus_ is more fit and proper for it, in that the curled
        threeds which seeme like haires, are better expressed by the
        word _Cincinnus_, then _Calamistrum_, this signifying but the
        bodkin or instrument wherewith they vse to frisle or curle the
        haire, and that the bush of haire it selfe being curled. Some
        also haue giuen to both these last the names of _Hyacinthus
        Comosus Parnassi_, the one fairer then the other. Of all these
        names you may vse which you please; but for the last kinde,
        the name _Cincinnatus_, as I said, is the more proper, but
        _Pennatus_ is the more common, and _Calamistratus_ for the
        former of the two last.

]


1. _Hyacinthus Orientalis Brumalis, siue præcox flore albo._
The white Winter Orientall Iacinth.

This early Iacinth riseth vp with his greene leaues (which are in
all respects like to the ordinary Orientall Iacinths, but somewhat
narrower) before Winter, and sometimes it is in flower also before
Winter, and is in forme and colour a plaine white Orientall Iacinth,
but somewhat lesser, differing onely in no other thing, then the time
of his flowring, which is alwayes certaine to be long before the other
sorts.


2. _Hyacinthus Orientalis Brumalis, siue præcox flore purpureo._
The purple Winter Orientall Iacinth.

The difference of colour in this flower causeth it to bee
distinguished, for else it is of the kindred of the Orientall Iacinths,
and is, as the former, more early then the rest that follow: Vnderstand
then, that this is the same with the former, but hauing fine blewish
purple flowers.


3. _Hyacinthus Orientalis maior præcox, dictus Zumbul Indi._
The greatest Orientall Iacinth, or Zumbul Indi.

The roote of this Orientall Iacinth, is vsually greater then any other
of his kinde, and most commonly white on the outside, from whence rise
vp one or two great round stalkes, spotted from within the ground, with
the lower part of the leaues also vpward to the middle of the stalkes,
or rather higher, like vnto the stalkes of Dragons, but darker; being
set among a number of broad, long, and somewhat hollow greene leaues,
almost as large as the leaues of the white Lilly: at the toppe of the
stalkes stand more store of flowers, then in any other of this kinde,
euery flower being as great as the greatest sort of Orientall Iacinths,
ending in six leaues, which turne at the points, of a faire blewish
purple colour, and all standing many times on one side of the stalkes,
and many times on both sides.


4. _Hyacinthus Orientalis vulgaris diuersorum colorum._
The ordinary Orientall Iacinth.

The common Orientall Iacinth (I call it common, because it is now so
plentifull in all Gardens, that it is almost not esteemed) hath many
greene leaues, long, somewhat broad and hollow, among which riseth
vp a long greene round stalke, beset from the middle thereof almost,
with diuers flowers, standing on both sides of the stalkes, one aboue
another vnto the toppe, each whereof next vnto the foote-stalke is
long, hollow, round, and close, ending in six small leaues laid open,
and a little turning at the points, of a very sweete smell: the colours
of these flowers are diuers, for some are pure white, without any shew
of other colour in them: another is almost white, but hauing a shew of
blewnesse, especially at the brims and bottomes of the flowers. Others
againe are of a very faint blush, tending towards a white: Some are of
as deepe a purple as a Violet; others of a purple tending to rednesse,
and some of a paler purple. Some againe are of a faire blew, others
more watchet, and some so pale a blew, as if it were more white then
blew: after the flowers are past, there rise vp great three square
heads, bearing round blacke seede, great and shining: the roote is
great, and white on the outside, and oftentimes purplish also, flat at
the bottome, and small at the head.

[Sidenote: _Flore purpureo violaceo lincis albicantis in dorso._]

There is a kinde of these Iacinths, whose flowers are of a deepe
purplish Violet colour, hauing whitish lines downe the backe of euery
leafe of the flower, which turne themselues a little backwards at the
points.

[Sidenote: _Floribus antrorsum respicientibus._]

There is another, whose flowers stand all opening one way, and not on
all sides, but are herein like the great Zumbul Indi, before set out.

[Sidenote: _Serotinus erectus floribus diuersorum colorum._]

There is againe another kinde which flowreth later then all the rest,
and the flowers are smaller, standing more vpright, which are either
white or blew, or mixt with white and purple.


5. _Hyacinthus Orientalis folioso caule._
The bushy stalked Orientall Iacinth.

This strange Iacinth hath his rootes, leaues, and flowers, like vnto
the former Orientall Iacinths: the onely difference in this is, that
his stalke is not bare or naked, but hath very narrow long leaues,
growing dispersedly, and without order, with the flowers thereon, which
are blew, and hauing for the most part one leafe, and sometimes two at
the foote, or setting on of euery flower, yet sometimes it happeneth,
some flowers to be without any leafe at the bottome, as nature, that is
very variable in this plant, listeth to play: the heads and seede are
blacke and round, like the other also.


6. _Hyacinthus Orientalis flore duplici._
The bleake Orientall Iacinth once double.

This double Iacinth hath diuers long leaues, like vnto the other
Orientall Iacinths, almost standing vpright, among which riseth vp
a stalke, brownish at the first, but growing greene afterwards,
bearing many flowers at the toppe, made like the flowers of the former
Iacinths, and ending in six leaues, greene at the first, and of a
blewish white when they are open, yet retaining some shew of greenesse
in them, the brims of the leaues being white; from the middle of each
flower standeth forth another small flower, consisting of three leaues,
of the same colour with the other flower, but with a greene line on
the backe of each of these inner leaues: in the middle of this little
flower, there stand some threeds tipt with blacke: the smell of this
flower is not so sweete as of the forme; the heads, seede, and rootes
are like the former.


7. _Hyacinthus Orientalis flore pleno cæruleo, vel purpuro violaceo._
The faire double blew, or purple Orientall Iacinth.

The leaues of these Iacinths are smaller, then the leaues of most of
the other former sorts; the stalkes are shorter, and smaller, bearing
but three or foure flowers on the heads of them for the most part,
which are not composed like the last, but are more faire, full, and
double of leaues, where they shew out their full beauties, and of
a faire blew colour in some, and purple in others, smelling pretty
sweete; but these doe seldome beare out their flowers faire; and
besides, haue diuers other flowers that will be either single, or very
little double vpon the same stalke.


8. _Hyacinthus Orientalis candidissimus flore pleno._
The pure white double Orientall Iacinth.

This double white Iacinth hath his leaues like vnto the single white
Orientall Iacinth; his stalke is likewise long, slender, and greene,
bearing at the toppe two or three flowers at the most, very double
and full of leaues, of a pure white colour, without any other mixture
therein, hanging downe their heads a little, and are reasonable sweete.
I haue this but by relation, not by sight, and therefore I can giue no
further assurance as yet.


        The Place.

        All these Orientall Iacinths, except the last, haue beene
        brought out of Turkie, and from Constantinople: but where their
        true originall place is, is not as yet vnderstood.


        The Time.

        The two first (as is said) flower the earliest, sometimes
        before Christmas, but more vsually after, and abide a great
        while in flower, in great beauty, especially if the weather be
        milde, when as few or no other flowers at that time are able to
        match them. The other greatest kinde flowreth also earlier then
        the rest that follow, for the most part. The ordinary kindes
        flower some in March, and some in Aprill, and some sooner also;
        and so doe the double ones likewise. The bushy stalked Iacinth
        flowreth much about the same time.


        The Names.

        The former two sorts are called _Hyacinthus Orientalis
        Brumalis_, and _Hyacinthus Orientalis præcox flore albo_, or
        _cæruleo_. The third is called of many _Zumbul Indicum_, or
        _Zumbul Indi_, and corruptly _Simboline_; of others, and that
        more properly, _Hyacinthus Orientalis maior præcox_. The Turkes
        doe call all Iacinths _Zumbul_, and by adding the name of
        _Indi_, or _Arabi_, do shew from what place they are receiued.
        In English, The greatest Orientall Iacinth; yet some doe call
        it after the Turkish name _Zumbul Indi_, or _Simboline_, as
        is said before. The rest haue their names set downe in their
        titles, which are most fit for them.


_Hyacinthus Hispanicus minor Orientalis facie._
The little Summer Orientall Iacinth.

[Sidenote: _Flore cæruleo._]

This little Iacinth hath foure or fiue long narrow greene leaues, lying
vpon the ground, among which riseth vp a slender smooth stalke, about
a spanne high or more, bearing at the toppe many slender bleake blew
flowers, with some white stripes and edges to be seene in most of them,
fashioned very like vnto the flowers of the Orientall Iacinth, but much
smaller: the flower hath no sent at all; the seede is like the seede of
the English Iacinth, or Hares-bels: the roote is small and white.

[Sidenote: _Flore albo._]

There is another of this kinde, differing in nothing but in the colour
of the flower, which is pure white.

[Sidenote: _Flore rubente._]

There is also another, whose flowers are of a fine delayed red colour,
with some deeper coloured veines, running along the three outer leaues
of the flower, differing in no other thing from the former.


        The Place.

        These plants haue been gathered on the Pyrenæan Mountaines,
        which are next vnto Spaine, from whence, as is often said, many
        rare plants haue likewise been gathered.


        The Time.

        They flower very late, euen after all or most of the Iacinths,
        in May for the most part.


        The Names.

        They are called eyther _Hyacinthus Hispanicus minor Orientalis
        facie_, as it is in the title, or _Hyacinthus Orientalis
        facie_, that is to say, The lesser Spanish Iacinth, like
        vnto the Orientall: yet some haue called them, _Hyacinthus
        Orientalis serotinus minor_, The lesser late Orientall Iacinth,
        that thereby they may be knowne from the rest.

]


_Hyacinthus Hispanicus obsoletus._   The Spanish dunne coloured Iacinth.

This Spanish Iacinth springeth very late out of the ground, bearing
foure or fiue short, hollow, and soft whitish greene leaues, with a
white line in the middle of euery one of them, among which rise vp
one or more stalkes, bearing diuers flowers at the toppes of them,
all looking one way, or standing on the one side, hanging downe their
heads, consisting of six leaues, three whereof being the outermost, lay
open their leaues, and turne back the ends a little again: the other
three which are innermost, do as it were close together in the middle
of the flower, without laying themselues open at all, being a little
whitish at the edges: the whole flower is of a purplish yellow colour,
with some white and green as it were mixed among it, of no sent at all:
it beareth blacke and flat seede in three square, great, and bunched
out heads: the roote is reasonable great, and white on the outside,
with many strong white fibres at it, which perish not yearely, as the
fibres of many other Iacinths doe, and as it springeth late, so it
holdeth his greene leaues almost vntill Winter.

[Sidenote: _Mauritanicus._]

There hath been another hereof brought from about Fez and Marocco in
Barbary, which in all respects was greater, but else differed little.

[Sidenote: _Maximus Æthiopicus._]

There was another also brought from the Cape of good Hope, whose leaues
were stronger and greener then the former, the stalke also thicker,
bearing diuers flowers, confusedly standing vpon longer foote-stalkes,
yet made after the same fashion, but that the three inner leaues were
whitish, and dented about the edges, otherwise the flowers were yellow
and greenish on the inside.


        The Place.

        These plants grow in Spaine, Barbary, and Ethiopia, according
        as their names and descriptions doe declare.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth not vntill Iune; for, as I said, it is very
        late before it springeth vp out of the ground, and holdeth his
        leaues as is said, vntill September, in the meane time the
        seede thereof ripeneth.


        The Names.

        They haue their names according to the place of their growing;
        for one is called _Hyacinthus Hispanicus obsoletioris coloris_.
        The other is called also _Hyacinthus Mauritanicus_. And the
        last, _Hyacinthus Æthiopicus obsoletus_. In English, The
        Spanish, Barbary, or Ethiopian Iacinth, of a dunne or duskie
        colour.


_Hyacinthus Anglicus Belgicus, vel Hispanicus._
English Hares-bels, or Spanish Iacinth.

Our English Iacinth or Hares-bels is so common euery where, that it
scarce needeth any description. It beareth diuers long and narrow
greene leaues, not standing vpright, nor yet fully lying vpon the
ground, among which springeth vp the stalke, bearing at the toppe many
long and hollow flowers, hanging downe their heads all forwards for
the most part, parted at the brimmes into six parts, turning vp their
points a little againe, of a sweetish, but heady sent, somewhat like
vnto the Grape-flower: the heads for seede are long and square, wherein
is much blacke seede; the colour of the flowers are in some of a deeper
blew, tending to a purple; in others of a paler blew, or of a bleake
blew, tending to an ash colour: Some are pure white, and some are party
coloured, blew and white; and some are of a fine delayed purplish red
or blush colour, which some call a peach colour. The rootes of all
sorts agree, and are alike, being white and very slimie; some whereof
will be great and round, others long and slender, and those that lye
neare the toppe of the earth bare, will be greene.


_Hyacinthus Hispanicus maior flore campanulæ instar._
The greater Spanish bell-flowred Iacinth.

This Spanish bell-flowred Iacinth, is very like the former English
or Spanish Iacinth, but greater in all parts, as well of leaues as
flowers, many growing together at the toppe of the stalke, with many
short greene leaues among them, hanging downe their heads, with larger,
greater, and wider open mouths, like vnto bels, of a darke blew colour,
and no good sent.


        The Place.

        The first groweth in many places of England, the
        Lowe-Countries, as we call them, and Spaine, but the last
        chiefly in Spaine.


        The Time.

        They flower in Aprill for the most part, and sometimes in May.


        The Names.

        Because the first is more frequent in England, then in Spaine
        or the Lowe-Countries, it is called with vs _Hyacinthus
        Anglicus_, The English Iacinth; but it is also called as
        well _Belgicus_, as _Hispanicus_: yet Dodonæus calleth it
        _Hyacinthus non scriptus_, because it was not written of by any
        Authour before himselfe. It is generally knowne in England by
        the name of Hare-bels. The other Spanish Iacinth beareth his
        name in his title.


_Hyacinthus Eriophorus._   The Woolly Iacinth.

This Woolly Iacinth hath many broad, long, and faire greene leaues,
very like vnto some of the Iacinths, but stiffer, or standing more
vpright, which being broken, doe yeeld many threeds, as if a little
fine cotton wooll were drawne out: among these leaues riseth vp a long
greene round stalke, a foote and a halfe high or more, whereon is set a
great long bush of flowers, which blowing open by degrees, first below,
and so vpwards, are very long in flowring: the toppe of the stalke,
with the flowers, and their little footstalkes, are all blew, euery
flower standing outright with his stalke, and spreading like a starre,
diuided into six leaues, hauing many small blew threeds, standing about
the middle head, which neuer gaue ripe seede, as farre as I can heare
of: the root is white, somewhat like the root of a Muscari, but as full
of wooll or threeds, or rather more, then the leaues, or any other part
of it.


        The Place.

        This hath been sent diuers times out of Turkie into England,
        where it continued a long time as well in my Garden as in
        others, but some hard frosty Winters caused it to perish with
        me, and diuers others, yet I haue had it againe from a friend,
        and doth abide fresh and greene euery yeare in my Garden.


        The Time.

        This flowred in the Garden of Mʳ. Richard Barnesley at Lambeth,
        onely once in the moneth of May, in the yeare 1606, after hee
        had there preserued it a long time: but neither he, nor any
        else in England that I know, but those that saw it at that
        time, euer saw it beare flower, either before or since.


        The Names.

        It is called by diuers _Bulbus Eriophorus_, or _Laniferus_,
        that is, Woolly Bulbous; but because it is a Iacinth, both in
        roote, leafe, and flower, and not a _Narcissus_, or Daffodill,
        it is called _Hyacinthus Eriophorus_, or _Laniferus_, The
        Woolly Iacinth. It is very likely, that Theophrastus in his
        seuenth Book & thirteenth Chapter, did meane this plant, where
        hee declareth, that garments were made of the woolly substance
        of a bulbous roote, that was taken from between the core or
        heart of the roote (which, as he saith, was vsed to be eaten)
        and the outermost shels or peelings; yet Clusius seemeth to
        fasten this woolly bulbous of Theophrastus, vpon the next
        Iacinth of Spaine.


_Hyacinthus Stellatus Bæticus maior, vulgò Perüanus._
The great Spanish Starry Iacinth, or of Peru.

This Iacinth (the greatest of those, whose flowers are spread like a
starre, except the two first Indians) hath fiue or six, or more, very
broad, and long greene leaues, spread vpon the ground, round about the
roote, which being broken are woolly, or full of threeds, like the
former: in the middle of these leaues riseth vp a round short stalke,
in comparison of the greatnesse of the plant (for the stalke of the
Orientall Iacinth is sometimes twice so high, whose roote is not so
great) bearing at the toppe a great head or bush of flowers, fashioned
in the beginning, before they bee blowne or separated, very like to
a Cone or Pineapple, and begin to flower belowe, and so vpwards by
degrees, euery flower standing vpon a long blackish blew foote-stalke,
which when they are blowne open, are of a perfect blew colour, tending
to a Violet, and made of six small leaues, laid open like a starre; the
threeds likewise are blewish, tipt with yellow pendents, standing about
the middle head, which is of a deeper blew, not hauing any good sent to
be perceiued in it, but commendable only for the beauty of the flowers:
after the flowers are past, there come three square heads, containing
round blacke seede: the roote is great, and somewhat yellowish on the
outside, with a knobbe or bunch at the lower end of the roote, (which
is called the seate of the roote) like vnto the Muscari, Scylla, and
many other bulbous rootes, at which hang diuers white, thicke, and
long fibres, whereby it is fastened in the ground, which perish not
euery yeare, but abide continually, and therefore doth not desire much
remouing.


_Hyacinthus Stellatus Bæticus, siue Perüanus flore albo._
The great white Spanish starry Iacinth.

This other Spanish Iacinth is in most parts like vnto the former, but
that his leaues are not so large, nor so deep a greene: the stalks of
flowers likewise hath not so thicke a head, or bush on it, but fewer
and thinner set: the flowers themselues also are whitish, yet hauing a
small dash of blush in them: the threeds are whitish, tipt with yellow
pendents: the seede and rootes are like vnto the former, and herein
consisteth the difference betweene this and the other sorts.


_Hyacinthus Stellatus Bæticus, siue Perüanus flore carneo._
The great blush coloured Spanish Starry Iacinth.

This likewise differeth little from the two former, but onely in the
colour of the flowers; for this being found growing among both the
other, hath his head of flowers as great and large as the first, but
the buds of his flowers, before they are open, are of a deepe blush
colour, which being open, are more delayed, and of a pleasant pale
purple, or blush colour, standing vpon purplish stalkes: the heads in
the middle are whitish, and so are the threeds compassing it, tipt with
yellow.

        The Place.

        These doe naturally grow in Spaine, in the Medowes a little
        off from the Sea, as well in the Island Gades, vsually called
        Cales, as likewise in other parts along the Sea side, as one
        goeth from thence to Porto Santa Maria, which when they be
        in flower, growing so thicke together, seeme to couer the
        ground, like vnto a tapistry of diuers colours, as I haue beene
        credibly enformed by Guillaume Boel, a Freeze-lander borne,
        often before and hereafter remembred, who being in search of
        rare plants in Spaine, in the yeare of our Lord 1607, after
        that most violent frosty Winter, which perished both the rootes
        of this, and many other fine plants with vs, sent mee ouer some
        of these rootes for my Garden, and affirmed this for a truth,
        which is here formerly set downe, and that himselfe gathered
        those he sent mee, and many others in the places named, with
        his owne hands; but hee saith, that both that with the white,
        and with the blush flowers, are farre more rare then the other.


        The Time.

        They flower in May, the seede is ripe in Iuly.


        The Names.

        This hath beene formerly named _Eriophorus Peruanus_, and
        _Hyacinthus Stellatus Peruanus_, The Starry Iacinth of Peru,
        being thought to haue grown in Peru, a Prouince of the West
        Indies; but he that gaue that name first vnto it, eyther knew
        not his naturall place, or willingly imposed that name, to
        conceale it, or to make it the better esteemed. It is most
        generally receiued by the name _Hyacinthus Peruanus_, from the
        first imposer thereof, that is, the Iacinth of Peru: but I had
        rather giue the name agreeing most fitly vnto it, and call it
        as it is indeede _Hyacinthus Stellatus Bæticus_, The Spanish
        Starry Iacinth; and because it is the greatest that I know
        hath come from thence, I call it, The great Starry Iacinth of
        Spaine, or Spanish Iacinth.


_Hyacinthus Stellatus vulgaris, siue Bifolius Fuchsij._
The common blew Starry Iacinth.

This Starry Iacinth (being longest knowne, and therefore most common)
riseth out of the ground, vsually but with two browne leaues, yet
sometimes with three, inclosing within them the stalke of flowers,
the buds appearing of a darke whitish colour, as soone as the leaues
open themselues, which leaues being growne, are long, and hollow, of
a whitish greene on the vpper side, and browne on the vnder side, and
halfe round, the browne stalke rising vp higher, beareth fiue or sixe
small starre-like flowers thereon, consisting of six leaues, of a faire
deepe blew, tending to a purple. The seede is yellowish, and round,
contained in round pointed heads, which by reason of their heauinesse,
and the weaknesse of the stalke, lye vpon the ground, and often perish
with wet and frosts, &c. The roote is somewhat long, and couered with a
yellowish coate.


_Hyacinthus stellatus flore albo._   The white Starry Iacinth.

The white Starry Iacinth hath his leaues like the former, but greene
and fresh, not browne, and a little narrower also: the buddes for
flowers at the first appeare a little blush, which when they are
blowne, are white, but yet retaine in them a small shew of that blush
colour.

[Sidenote: _Flore niueo._]

We haue another, whose flowers are pure white, and smaller then the
other, the leaues whereof are of a pale fresh greene, and somewhat
narrower.


_Hyacinthus Stellatus flore rubente._
The blush coloured Starry Iacinth.

The difference in this from the former, is onely in the flowers, which
are of a faire blush colour, much more eminent then in the others, in
all things else alike.


_Hyacinthus Stellatus Martius, siue præcox cæruleus._
The early blew Starry Iacinth.

This Iacinth hath his leaues a little broader, of a fresher greene,
and not browne at all, as the first blew Iacinth of Fuchsius last
remembred: the buds of the flowers, while they are enclosed within the
leaues, and after, when the stalke is growne vp, doe remaine more blew
then the buds of the former: the flowers, when they are blowne open,
are like the former, but somewhat larger, and of a more liuely blew
colour: the roote also is a little whiter on the outside. This doth
more seldome beare seede then the former.


_Hyacinthus Stellatus præcox flore albo._
The white early Starry Iacinth.

There is also one other of this kinde, that beareth pure white flowers,
the green leafe thereof being a little narrower then the former, and no
other difference.


_Hyacinthus Stellatus præcox flore suaue rubente._
The early blush coloured Starry Iacinth.

This blush coloured Iacinth is very rare, but very pleasant, his
flowers being as large as the first of this last kinde, and somewhat
larger then the blush of the other kinde: the leaues and rootes differ
not from the last recited Iacinth.


        The Place.

        All these Iacinths haue beene found in the Woods and Mountaines
        of Germany, Bohemia, and Austria, as Fuchsius and Gesner doe
        report, and in Naples, as Imperatus and others doe testifie.
        Wee cherish them all with great care in our Gardens, but
        especially the white and the blush of both kindes, for that
        they are more tender, and often perish for want of due regard.


        The Time.

        The common kindes, which are first expressed, flower about the
        middle of February, if the weather bee milde, and the other
        kindes sometimes a fortnight after, that is, in March, but
        ordinarily much about the same time with the former.


        The Names.

        The first is called in Latine _Hyacinthus Stellatus vulgaris_,
        and _Hyacinthus Stellatus bifolius_, and _Hyacinthus Stellaris
        Fuchsij_ and of some _Hyacinthus Stellatus Germanicus_; wee
        might very well call the other kinde, _Hyacinthus Stellatus
        vulgaris alter_, but diuers call it _Præcox_, and some
        _Martius_, as it is in the title. In English they may bee
        seuerally called: the first, The common; and the other, The
        early Starry Iacinth (notwithstanding the first flowreth before
        the other) for distinction sake.

        The _Hyacinthus_, seemeth to be called _Vacinium_ of Virgil in
        his Eclogues; for hee alwayes reckoneth it among the flowers
        that were vsed to decke Garlands, and neuer among fruits,
        as some would haue it. But in that hee calleth it _Vacinium
        nigrum_, in seuerall places, that doth very fitly answer the
        common receiued custome of those times, that called all deepe
        blew colours, such as are purples, and the like, blacke; for
        the Violet it selfe is likewise called blacke in the same
        place, where he calleth the _Vacinium_ blacke; so that it
        seemeth thereby, that he reckoned them to be both of one
        colour, and we know the colour of the Violet is not blacke, as
        we doe distinguish of blacke in these dayes. But the colour of
        this Starry Iacinth, being both of so deepe a purple sometimes,
        so neare vnto a Violet colour, and also more frequent, then any
        other Iacinth with them, in those places where Virgil liued,
        perswadeth me to thinke, that Virgil vnderstood this Starry
        Iacinth by _Vacinium_: Let others iudge otherwise, if they can
        shew greater probabilitie.


1. _Hyacinthus Stellatus Byzantinus nigra radice._
The Starry Iacinth of Turkie with the blacke roote.

This Starry Iacinth of Constantinople hath three or foure fresh greene,
thinne, and long leaues, of the bignesse of the English Iacinth, but
not so long, betweene which riseth vp a slender lowe stalke, bearing
fiue or six small flowers, dispersedly set thereon, spreading open like
a starre, of a pale or bleake blew colour: the leaues of the flowers
are somewhat long, and stand as it were somewhat loosly, one off from
another, and not so compactly together, as the flowers of other kindes:
it seldome beareth ripe seede with vs, because the heads are so heauie,
that lying vpon the ground, they rotte with the wet, or are bitten with
the frosts, or both, so that they seldome come to good: the roote is
small in some, and reasonable bigge in others, round, and long, white
within, but couered with deepe reddish or purplish peelings, next vnto
it, and darker and blacker purple on the outside, with some long and
thicke white fibres, like fingers hanging at the bottome of them, as
is to be seene in many other Iacinths: the roote it selfe for the most
part doth runne downewards, somewhat deep into the ground.


2. _Hyacinthus Stellatus Byzantinus maior._
The greater Starry Iacinth of Constantinople.

This Iacinth may rightly be referred to the former Iacinth of
Constantinople, and called the greater, it is so like thereunto, that
any one that knoweth that, will soone say, that this is another of that
sort, but greater as it is in all his parts, bearing larger leaues by
much, and more store, lying vpon the ground round about the roote: it
beareth many lowe stalkes of flowers, as bleake, and standing as loosly
as the former: onely the roote of this, is not black on the outside, as
the other, but three times bigger.


3. _Hyacinthus Stellatus Byzantinus alter, siue flore boraginis._
The other Starry Iacinth of Constantinople.

This other Iacinth hath for the most part onely foure leaues, broader
and greener then the first, but not so large or long as the second: the
stalke hath fiue or six flowers vpon it, bigger and rounder set, like
other starry Iacinths, of a more perfect or deeper blew then either of
the former, hauing a whitish greene head or vmbone in the middle, beset
with six blew chiues or threeds, tipt with blacke, so closly compassing
the vmbone, that the threeds seeme so many prickes stucke into a clubbe
or head; some therefore haue likened it to the flower of Borage, and so
haue called it: after the flowers are past, come vp round white heads,
wherein is contained round and white seede: the roote is of a darke
whitish colour on the outside, and sometimes a little reddish withall.


        The Place.

        The first and the last haue beene brought from Constantinople;
        the first among many other rootes, and the last by the Lord
        Zouch, as Lobel witnesseth. The second hath been sent vs out
        of the Lowe-Countries, but from whence they had it, we do not
        certainly know. They growe with vs in our Gardens sufficiently.


        The Time.

        These flower in Aprill, but the first is the earliest of
        the rest, and is in flower presently after the early Starry
        Iacinth, before described.


        The Names.

        The former haue their names in their titles, and are not knowne
        vnto vs by any other names that I know; but as I said before,
        the last is called by some, _Hyacinthus Boraginis flore_. The
        first was sent out of Turkie, by the name of _Susamgiul_, by
        which name likewise diuers other things haue beene sent, so
        barren and barbarous is the Turkish tongue.


_Hyacinthus Stellatus Æstivus maior._
The greater Summer Starry Iacinth.

This late Iacinth hath diuers narrow greene leaues, lying vpon the
ground, somewhat like the leaues of the English Iacinth, but stiffer
and stronger; among which riseth vp a round stiffe stalke, bearing many
flowers at the toppe thereof, and at euery foote-stalke of the flowers
a small short leafe, of a purplish colour: the flowers are starre-like,
of a fine delayed purplish colour, tending to a pale blew or ash
colour, striped on the backe of euery leafe, and hauing a pointed
vmbone in the middle, with some whitish purple threeds about it, tipt
with blew: the seede is blacke, round, and shining, like vnto the seede
of the English Iacinth, but not so bigge: the roote is round and white,
hauing some long thicke rootes vnder it, besides the fibres, as is
vsuall in many other Iacinths.


_Hyacinthus Stellatus Æstivus minor._
The lesser Summer Starry Iacinth.

This lesser Iacinth hath diuers very long, narrow, and shining
greene leaues, spread vpon the ground round about the roote, among
which riseth vp a very short round stalke, not aboue two inches
high, carrying six or seuen small flowers thereon, on each side of
the stalke, like both in forme and colour vnto the greater before
described, but lesser by farre: the seede is blacke, contained in three
square heads: the roote is small and white, couered with a browne
coate, and hauing some such thicke rootes among the fibres, as are
among the other.


        The Place.

        Both these Iacinths grow naturally in Portugall, and from
        thence haue been brought, by such as seeke out for rare plants,
        to make a gaine and profit by them.


        The Time.

        They both flower in May, and not before: and their seed is ripe
        in Iuly.


        The Names.

        Some doe call these _Hyacinthus Lusitanicus_, The Portugall
        Iacinth. Clusius, who first set out the descriptions of them,
        called them as is expressed in their titles; and therefore we
        haue after the Latine name giuen their English, according as is
        set downe. Or if you please, you may call them, The greater and
        the lesser Portugall Iacinth.


_Hyacinthus Stellaris flore cinereo._   The ash coloured Starry Iacinth.

This ash coloured Iacinth, hath his leaues very like vnto the leaues of
the English Iacinth, and spreading vpon the ground in the same manner,
among which rise vp one or two stalkes, set at the toppe with a number
of small starre-like flowers, bushing bigger below then aboue, of a
very pale or white blew, tending to an ash colour, and very sweete
in smell: the seede is blacke and round, like vnto the seede of the
English Iacinth, and so is the roote, being great, round, and white; so
like, I say, that it is hard to know the one from the other.


        The Place.

        The certaine originall place of growing thereof, is not knowne
        to vs.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in Aprill.


        The Names.

        Some doe call this _Hyacinthus Someri_, Somers Iacinth, because
        as Lobel saith, he brought it first into the Lowe-Countries,
        eyther from Constantinople, or out of Italy.


_Hyacinthus Stellatus Lilifolio & radice cæruleo._
The blew Lilly leafed Starre Iacinth.

This Iacinth hath six or seuen broad greene leaues, somewhat like vnto
Lilly leaues, but shorter (whereof it tooke his name as well as from
the roote) spread vpon the ground, and lying close and round: before
the stalke riseth out from the middle of these leaues, there doth
appeare a deepe hollow place, like a hole, to bee seene a good while,
which at length is filled vp with the stalke, rising thence vnto a
foote or more high, bearing many starre-like flowers at the toppe, of
a perfect blew colour, neare vnto a Violet, and sometimes of paler or
bleake blew colour, hauing as it were a small cuppe in the middle,
diuided into six peeces, without any threeds therein: the seede is
blacke and round, but not shining: the roote is somewhat long, bigge
belowe, and small aboue, like vnto the small roote of a Lilly, and
composed of yellow scales, as a Lilly, but the scales are greater, and
fewer in number.


_Hyacinthus Stellatus Lilifolius albus._
The white Lilly leafed Starre Iacinth.

The likenesse of this Iacinth with the former, causeth me to be briefe,
and not to repeate the same things againe, that haue already been
expressed: You may therefore vnderstand, that except in the colour of
the flower, which in this is white, there is no difference betweene
them.

[Sidenote: _Flore carneo._]

I heare of one that should beare blush coloured flowers, but I haue not
yet seene any such.


        The Place.

        These Iacinths haue been gathered on the Pyrenæan Hils, in that
        part of France that is called Aquitaine, and in some other
        places.


        The Time.

        These flower in Aprill, and sometimes later.


        The Names.

        Because the roote is so like vnto a Lilly, as the leafe is
        also, it hath most properly beene called _Hyacinthus Stellatus
        Lilifolio & radice_, or for breuity _Lilifolius_, that is, The
        Starry Lilly leafed Iacinth. It is called _Sarahug_ by the
        Inhabitants where it groweth, as Clusius maketh the report from
        Venerius, who further saith, that by experience they haue found
        the cattell to swell and dye, that haue eaten of the leaues
        thereof.

]


_Hyacinthus Autumnalis maior._   The greater Autumne Iacinth.

The greater Autumne Iacinth hath fiue or six very long and narrow
greene leaues, lying vpon the ground; the stalkes are set at the toppe
with many starre-like flowers, of a pale blewish purple colour, with
some pale coloured threeds, tipt with blew, standing about the head in
the middle, which in time growing ripe, containeth therein small blacke
seede, and roundish: the roote is great and white on the outside.


_Hyacinthus Autumnalis minor._   The lesser Autumne Iacinth.

This lesser Iacinth hath such like long and small leaues, but narrower
then the former: the stalke is not full so high, but beareth as many
flowers on it as the other, which are of a pale or bleake purple
colour, very like vnto it also: the roote and seed are like the former,
but smaller. These both for the most part, beare their flowers and
seede before the greene leaues rise vp much aboue the ground.

[Sidenote: _Flore albo._]

There is a kinde hereof found that beareth white flowers, not differing
in any other thing from the smaller purple kinde last mentioned.


        The Place.

        The first and last are onely kept in Gardens, and not knowne to
        vs where their naturall place of growing wilde may be.

        The second groweth wilde in many places of England. I gathered
        diuers rootes for my Garden, from the foote of a high banke by
        the Thames side, at the hither end of Chelsey, before you come
        at the Kings Barge-house.


        The Time.

        The greatest flowreth in the end of Iuly, and in August.

        The other in August and September, you shall seldome see this
        plant with flowers and greene leaues at one time together.


        The Names.

        They haue their names giuen them, as they are expressed in
        their titles, by all former Writers, except Daleschampius,
        or hee that set forth that great worke printed at Lyons; for
        hee contendeth with many words, that these plants can bee no
        Iacinths, because their flowers appeare before their leaues
        in Autumne, contrary to the true Iacinth, as he saith: and
        therefore he would faine haue it referred to _Theophrastus
        bulbus in libro primo cap. 12._ and calleth it his _Tiphyum_
        mentioned in that place, as also _Bulbus astivus Dalechampij_.
        Howsoeuer these things may carry some probability in them, yet
        the likenesse both of rootes, and flowers especially, hath
        caused very learned Writers to entitle them as is set downe,
        and therefore I may not but let them passe in the like manner.


        The Vertues.

        Both the rootes and the leaues of the Iacinths are somewhat
        cold and drying, but the seede much more. It stayeth the
        loosnesse of the belly. It is likewise said to hinder young
        persons from growing ripe too soone, the roote being drunke
        in wine. It helpeth them also whose vrine is stopt, and is
        auaileable for the yellow Iaundise; but as you heare some are
        deadly to cattell, I therefore wish all to bee well aduised
        which of these they will vse in any inward physicke.


_Scilla alba._   The Sea Onion or Squill.

As I ended the discourse of both the true and the bastard Daffodils,
with the Sea kindes of both sorts; so I thinke it not amisse, to
finish this of the Iacinths with the description of a Sea Iacinth,
which (as you see) I take to be the _Scilla_, or Sea Onion, all his
parts so nearely resembling a Iacinth, that I know not where to ranke
him better then in this place, or rather not any where but here. You
shall haue the description thereof, and then let the iudicious passe
their sentence, as they thinke meetest.

The Squill or Sea Onion (as many doe call it) hath diuers thicke
leaues, broad, long, greene, and hollowish in the middle, and with an
eminent or swelling ribbe all along the backe of the leafe, (I relate
it as I haue seene it, hauing shot forth his leaues in the ship by
the way, as the Mariners that brought diuers rootes from out of the
Straights, did sell them to mee and others for our vse) lying vpon
the ground, somewhat like vnto the leaues of a Lilly: these spring vp
after the flowers are past, and the seed ripe, they abiding all the
Winter, and the next Spring, vntill the heate of the Summer hath spent
and consumed them, and then about the end of August, or beginning of
September, the stalke with flowers ariseth out of the ground a foote
and a halfe high, bearing many starre-like flowers on the toppe, in a
long spike one aboue another, flowring by degrees, the lowest first,
and so vpwards, whereby it is long in flowring, very like, as well in
forme as bignesse, to the flowers of the great Starre of Bethlehem
(these flowers I haue likewise seene shooting out of some of the
rootes, that haue been brought in the like manner:) after the flowers
are past, there come vp in their places thicke and three square heads,
wherin is contained such like flat, black, and round seed, as the
Spanish duskie Iacinth before described did beare, but greater: the
root is great & white, couered with many peelings or couerings, as is
plainly enough seen to any that know them, and that sometimes wee haue
had rootes, that haue beene as bigge as a pretty childes head, and
sometimes two growing together, each whereof was no lesse then is said
of the other.


_Scilla rubra siue Pancratium verum._   The red Sea Onion.

The roote of this Squill, is greater oftentimes then of the former,
the outer coates or peelings being reddish, bearing greater, longer,
stiffer, and more hollow leaues, in a manner vpright: this bringeth
such a like stalke and flowers, as the former doth, as Fabianus Ilges,
Apothecary to the Duke of Briga, did signifie by the figure thereof
drawne and sent to Clusius.


        The Place.

        They grow alwayes neare the Sea, and neuer farre off from it,
        but often on the very baich of the Sea, where it washeth ouer
        them all along the coasts of Spaine, Portugal, and Italy, and
        within the Straights in many places: it will not abide in any
        Garden farre from the Sea, no not in Italy, as it is related.


        The Time.

        The time wherein they flower, is expressed to be in August and
        September: this seede to be ripe in October and Nouember, and
        the greene leaues to spring vp in Nouember and December.


        The Names.

        These are certainly the true kindes of _Scilla_ that should
        bee vsed in medicines, although (as Clusius reporteth) the
        Spaniards forbade him to taste of the red Squill, as of a
        most strong and present poison. Pliny hath made more sorts
        then can be found out yet to this day with vs: that _Scilla_
        that is called _Epimenidia_, because it might be eaten, is
        thought to be the great _Ornithogalum_, or Starre of Bethlehem.
        _Pancratium_ is, I know, and as I said before, referred to that
        kinde of bastard Sea Daffodill, which is set forth before in
        the end of the history of the bastard Daffodils; and diuers
        also would make the _Narcissus tertius Matthioli_, which I
        call the true Sea Daffodill, to be a _Pancratium_; but seeing
        Dioscorides (and no other is against him) maketh _Pancratium_
        to be a kinde of Squill with reddish rootes, I dare not vphold
        their opinion against such manifest truth.


        The Vertues.

        The Squill or Sea Onion is wholly vsed physically with vs,
        because wee can receiue no pleasure from the sight of the
        flowers. Pliny writeth, that Pithagoras wrote a volume or booke
        of the properties thereof, for the singular effects it wrought;
        which booke is lost, yet the diuers vertues it hath is recorded
        by others, to be effectual for the spleene, lungs, stomach,
        liuer, head and heart; and for dropsies, old coughs, Iaundise,
        and the wormes; that it cleareth the sight, helpeth the
        tooth-ache, cleanseth the head of scurfe, and running sores;
        and is an especiall Antidote against poison: and therefore is
        vsed as a principall ingredient into the _Theriaca Andromachi_,
        which we vsually call Venice Treakle. The Apothecaries prepare
        hereof, both Wine, Vinegar, and Oxymel or Syrupe, which is
        singular to extenuate and expectorate tough flegme, which is
        the cause of much disquiet in the body, and an hinderer of
        concoction, or digestion in the stomach, besides diuers other
        wayes, wherein the scales of the rootes, being dryed, are
        vsed. And Galen hath sufficiently explained the qualities and
        properties thereof, in his eight Booke of Simples.




CHAP. XII.


_Ornithogalum._   Starre of Bethlehem.

After the Family of the Iacinths, must needes follow the kindes of
Starre-flowers, or Starres of Bethlehem, as they are called, for that
they doe so nearely resemble them, that diuers haue named some of
them Iacinths, and referred them to that kindred: all of them, both
in roote, leafe, and flower, come nearer vnto the Iacinths, then vnto
any other plant. They shall therefore bee next described, euery one in
their order, the greatest first, and the rest following.


_Ornithogalum Arabicum._   The great Starre-flower of Arabia.

This Arabian Starre-flower hath many broad, and long greene leaues,
very like vnto the leaues of the Orientall Iacinth, but lying for the
most part vpon the ground, among which riseth vp a round greene stalke,
almost two foote high, bearing at the toppe diuers large flowers,
standing vpon long foote-stalkes, and at the bottome of euery one of
them a small short pointed greene leafe: these flowers are made of six
pure white leaues a peece, laid open as large as an ordinary Daffodill,
but of the forme of a Starre Iacinth, or Starre of Bethlehem, which
close as they doe euery night, and open themselues in the day time,
especially in the Sunne, the smell whereof is pretty sweete, but weake:
in the middle of the flower is a blackish head, compassed with six
white threeds, tipt with yellow pendents: the seede hath not beene
obserued with vs: the roote is great and white, with a flat bottome,
very impatient of our cold Winters, so that it seldome prospereth or
abideth with vs; for although sometimes it doe abide a Winter in the
ground, yet it often lyeth without springing blade, or any thing else
a whole yeare, and then perisheth: or if it doe spring, yet many doe
not beare, and most after their first bearing doe decay and perish. But
if any be desirous, to know how to preserue the roote of this plant,
or of many other bulbous rootes that are tender, such as the great
double white Daffodill of Constantinople, and other fine Daffodils,
that come from hot Countries; let them keepe this rule: Let either the
roote be planted in a large pot, or tubbe of earth, and housed all the
Winter, that so it may bee defended from the frosts; Or else (which is
the easier way) keepe the roote out of the ground euery yeare, from
September, after the leaues and stalkes are past, vntill February, in
some dry, but not hot or windy place, and then plant it in the ground
vnder a South wall, or such like defended place, which will spring, and
no doubt prosper well there, in regard the greatest and deepest frosts
are past after February, so that seldome any great frosts come after,
to pierce so deepe as the roote is to be set, or thereby to doe any
great harme to it in such a place.


        The Place.

        This hath been often sent out of Turkie, and likewise out
        of Italy; I had likewise two rootes sent mee out of Spaine
        by Guillaume Boel before remembred, which (as hee said) hee
        gathered there, but they prospered not with me, for want of the
        knowledge of the former rule. It may be likely that Arabia is
        the place, from whence they of Constantinople receiue it.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in May, if it be of the first yeares bringing; or
        in Iune, if it haue been ordered after the manner before set
        downe.


        The Names.

        It hath been sent out of Italy by the name of _Lilium
        Alexandrinum_, The Lilly of Alexandria, but it hath no affinity
        with any Lilly. Others call it _Hyacinthus Arabicus_; and the
        Italians, _Iacintho del pater nostro_; but it is no Iacinth
        neither, although the flowers be like some of them. Some
        also would referre it to a _Narcissus_ or Daffodill, and it
        doth as little agree with it, as with a Lilly, although his
        flowers in largenesse and whitenesse resemble a Daffodill.
        Clusius hath most fitly referred it to the stocke or kindred
        of _Ornithogala_, or Starres of Bethlehem, as wee call them in
        English, and from the Turkish name, _Zumbul Arabi_, entituled
        it _Ornithogalum Arabicum_, although _Zumbul_, as I haue before
        declared, is with them, a Iacinth, wee may call it in English,
        The Arabian Starre-flower, or Starre of Bethlehem, or the great
        Starre-flower of Arabia.


1. _Ornithogalum maximum album._
The greatest white Starre-flower, or Starre of Bethlehem.

This great Starre-flower hath many faire, broad, long, and very fresh
green leaues, rising vp very early, and are greater, longer, and
greener then the leaues of any Orientall Iacinth, which doe abide
greene, from the beginning or middle of Ianuary, or before sometimes,
vntill the end of May, at which time they begin to fade, and the stalke
with the head of flowers beginneth to rise, so that it will haue either
few or no leaues at all, when the flowers are blowne: the stalke is
strong, round, and firme, rising two foote high or more, bearing at
the toppe a great bush of flowers, seeming at the first to be a great
greene eare of corne, for it is made spike-fashion, which when the
flowers are blowne, doth rise to be very high, slender or small at the
head aboue, and broad spread and bushing below, so that it is long
in flowring; for they flower below first, and so vpwards by degrees:
these flowers are snow white, without any line on the backside, and is
therein like vnto the former, as also in whitenesse, but nothing so
large, with a white vmbone or head in the middle, beset with many white
threeds, tipt with yellow: the seede is blacke and round, contained in
three square heads: the roote is great, thicke, and short, and somewhat
yellowish on the outside, with a flat bottome, both like the former,
and next that followeth.


2. _Ornithogalum maius spicatum album._
The great white spiked Starre-flower.

This spiked Starre-flower in his growing, is somewhat like vnto the
last described, but springeth not vp so early, nor hath his leaues so
greene, or large, but hath broad, long, whitish greene hollow leaues,
pointed at the end, among which riseth vp the stalke, which is strong
and high, as the former, hauing a great bush of flowers at the toppe,
standing spike-fashion, somewhat like the former, flowring in the same
maner by degrees, first below, and so vpwards; but it is not so thicke
set with flowers, nor so farre spread at the bottome as it, the flowers
also are not so white, and each of the leaues of them haue a greene
line downe the backe, leauing the edges on both sides white: after
the flowers are past, the heads for seede grow three square, like the
other, bearing such like blacke seede therein: the roote hereof is
vsually bigger then the last, and whiter on the outside.


3. _Ornithogalum Pannonicum._   The Hungarian Starre-flower.

This Hungarian Starre-flower shooteth out diuers narrow, long, whitish
greene leaues, spread vpon the ground before Winter, which are very
like vnto the leaues of Gilloflowers, and so abide aboue the ground,
hauing a stalke rising in the middle of them the next Spring, about
halfe a foote high or thereabouts, bearing many white flowers at the
toppe, with greene lines downe the backe of them, very like vnto the
ordinary Starres of Bethlehem: the roote is greater, thicker, and
longer then the ordinary Starres, and for the most part, two ioyned
together, somewhat grayish on the outside.


4. _Ornithogalum vulgare._   The Starre of Bethlehem.

The ordinary Starre of Bethlehem is so common, and well knowne in all
countries and places, that it is almost needlesse to describe it,
hauing many greene leaues with white lines therein, and a few white
flowers set about the toppe of the stalke, with greenish lines downe
the backe: the roote is whitish, and encreaseth aboundantly.


5. _Asphodelus bulbosus Galeni, siue Ornithogalum maius flore
subuirescente._
The bulbous Asphodill, or greene Starre-flower.

Diuers haue referred this plant vnto the Asphodils, because (as I
thinke) the flowers hereof are straked on the backe, and the leaues
long and narrow, like vnto the Asphodils; but the roote of this being
bulbous, I rather (as some others doe) ioyne it with the _Ornithogala_,
for they also haue strakes on the backe of the flowers. It hath many
whitish greene leaues, long and narrow, spread vpon the ground, which
spring vp in the beginning of the yeare, and abide vntill May, and then
they withering, the stalke springeth vp almost as high as the first,
hauing many pale yellowish greene flowers, but smaller, and growing
more sparsedly about the stalke vpon short foot-stalkes, but in a
reasonable long head spike-fashion: the seede is like vnto the second
kinde, but smaller: the roote is somewhat yellowish, like the first
great white kinde.

]


        The Place.

        The first is onely nursed in Gardens, his originall being not
        well knowne, yet some attribute it vnto _Pannonia_ or Hungary.
        The second hath been found neare vnto Barcinone, and Toledo in
        Spaine. The third was found in Hungary by Clusius. Our ordinary
        euery where in the fields of Italy and France, and (as it is
        said) in England also. And the last groweth likewise by the
        corne fields in the vpper Hungary.


        The Time.

        They flower in Aprill and May, and sometimes in Iune.


        The Names.

        The first is called by Clusius _Ornithogalum maximum album_,
        because it is greater then the next, which hee tooke formerly
        for the greatest: but it might more fitly, in my iudgement, bee
        called _Asphodelus bulbosus albus_ (if there be any _Asphodelus
        bulbosus_ at all) because this do so nearly resemble that, both
        in the early springing, and the decay of the greene leaues,
        when the stalkes of flowers doe rise vp. Diuers also doe call
        it _Ornithogalum Pannonicum maximum album_.

        The second hath his name in his title, as most authors doe set
        it downe, yet in the great Herball referred to Dalechampius, it
        is called _Ornithogalum magnum Myconi_.

        The third hath his name from the place of his birth, and the
        other from his popularity, yet Dodonæus calleth it _Bulbus
        Leucanthemos_.

        The last is called by diuers _Asphodelo-hyacinthinus_, and
        _Hyacintho-asphodelus Galeni_. Dodonæus calleth it _Asphodelus
        fæmina_, and _Asphodelus bulbosus_. But Lobel, and Gerrard
        from him, and Dodonæus, doe make this to haue white flowers,
        whereas all that I haue seene, both in mine owne, and in
        others Gardens, bore greenish flowers, as Clusius setteth it
        truely downe. Lobel seemeth in the description of this, to
        confound the _Ornithogalum_ of Mompelier with it, and calleth
        it _Asphodelus hyacinthinus forte Galeni_, and saith that
        some would call it _Pancratium Monspeliense_, and _Asphodelus
        Galeni_. But as I haue shewed, the _Ornithogalum spicatum_ and
        this, doe plainly differ the one from the other, and are not
        both to be called by one name, nor to be reckoned one, but two
        distinct plants.


_Ornithogalum Æthiopicum._   The Starre-flower of Æthiopia.

The leaues of this plant are a foote long, and at the least an inch
broad, which being broken, are no lesse woolly then the woolly Iacinth:
the stalke is a cubit high, strong and greene; from the middle whereof
vnto the toppe, stand large snow white flowers, vpon long, greene,
thicke foot-stalkes, and yellowish at the bottome of the flower; in
the middle whereof stand six white threeds, tipt with yellow chiues,
compassing the head, which is three square, and long containing the
seede: the roote is thicke and round, somewhat like the _Asphodelus
Galeni_.


        The Place.

        This plant was gathered by some Hollanders, on the West side of
        the Cape of good Hope.


        The Time.

        It flowred about the end of August with those that had it.


        The Names.

        Because it came from that part of the continent beyond the
        line, which is reckoned a part of Æthiopia, it is thereupon so
        called as it is set downe.


_Ornithogalum Neapolitanum._   The Starre-flower of Naples.

This beautifull plant riseth out of the ground very early, with foure
or fiue hollow pointed leaues, standing round together, of a whitish
greene colour, with a white line downe the middle of euery leafe on the
inside, somewhat narrow, but long, (Fabius Columna saith, three foot
long in Italy, but it is not so with vs) in the middle of these leaues
riseth vp the stalke, a foote and a halfe high, bearing diuers flowers
at the toppe, euery one standing in a little cuppe or huske, which is
diuided into three or foure parts, hanging downe very long about the
heads for seede: after the flower is past, these flowers doe all hang
downe their heads, and open one way, although their little foot-stalkes
come forth on all sides of the greater stalke, being large, and
composed of six long leaues, of a pure white on the inside, and of a
blewish or whitish greene colour on the outside, leauing the edges of
euery leafe white on both sides: in the middle of these flowers stand
other small flowers, each of them also made of six small white leaues
a peece, which meeting together, seeme to make the shew of a cuppe,
within which are contained six white threeds, tipt with yellow, and a
long white pointell in the middle of them, being without any sent at
all: after the flowers are past, come vp great round heads, which are
too heauie for the stalke to beare; and therefore lye downe vpon the
leaues or ground, hauing certaine lines or stripes on the outside,
wherein is contained round, blacke, rough seede: the roote is great and
white, and somewhat flat at the bottome, as diuers of these kindes are,
and doe multiply as plentifully into small bulbes as the common or any
other.


        The Place.

        This Starre-flower groweth in the Medowes in diuers places
        of Naples, as Fabius Columna, and Ferrantes Imperatus doe
        testifie, from whence they haue been sent. And Matthiolus, who
        setteth out the figure thereof among his Daffodills, had (it
        should seeme) seene it grow with him.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in May, although it begin to spring out of the
        ground oftentimes in Nouember, but most vsually in Ianuary: the
        seede is ripe in Iuly.


        The Names.

        Matthiolus reckoneth this (as is said) among the Daffodils,
        for no other respect, as I conceiue, then that he accounted
        the middle flower to bee the cuppe or trunke of a Daffodill,
        which it doth somewhat resemble, and setteth it forth in the
        fourth place, whereupon many doe call it _Narcissus quartus
        Matthioli_, The fourth Daffodill of Matthiolus. Fabius Columna
        calleth it _Hyacinthus aruorum Ornithogali flore_. Clusius
        (to whom Imperatus sent it, in stead of the Arabian which hee
        desired) calleth it of the place from whence he receiued it,
        _Ornithogalum Neapolitanum_, and we thereafter call it in
        English, The Starre-flower of Naples.


_Ornithogalum Hispanicum minus._   The little Starre-flower of Spaine.

Clusius hath set forth this plant among his _Ornithogala_ or
Starre-flowers, and although it doth in my minde come nearer to a
_Hyacinthus_, then to _Ornithogalum_, yet pardon it, and let it passe
as he doth. From a little round whitish roote, springeth vp in the
beginning of the yeare, fiue or six small long green leaues, without
any white line in the middle of them, among which rise vp one or two
small stalkes, an hand length high or better, bearing seuen or eight,
or more flowers, growing as it were in a tuft or vmbell, with small
long leaues at the foote of euery stalke, the lower flowers being
equall in length with the vppermost, of a pale whitish blew or ash
colour, with a strake or line downe the backe of euery leafe of them,
with some white threeds standing about a blewish head in the middle:
these flowers passe away quickly, and giue no seed, so that it is not
knowne what seede it beareth.


        The Place.

        This groweth in Spaine, and from thence hath been brought to vs.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in May.


        The Names.

        It hath no other name then is set down in the title, being but
        lately found out.


1. _Ornithogalum album vnifolium._
The white starre-flower with one blade.

This little starre-flower I bring into this place, as the fittest in
my opinion where to place it, vntill my minde change to alter it. It
hath a very small round white roote, from whence springeth vp one very
long and round greene leafe, like vnto a rush, but that for about
two or three inches aboue the ground, it is a little flat, and from
thence springeth forth a small stalke not aboue three or foure inches
high, bearing at the top thereof three or foure small white flowers,
consisting of six leaues a peece, within which are six white chiues,
tipt with yellow pendents, standing about a small three square head,
that hath a white pointell sticking as it were in the middle thereof:
the flower is pretty and sweete, but not heady.


_Ornithogalum luteum._   The yellow Starre of Bethlehem.

This yellow Starre-flower riseth vp at the first, with one long, round,
greenish leafe, which openeth it selfe somewhat aboue the ground, and
giueth out another small leafe, lesser and shorter then the first,
and afterward the stalke riseth from thence also, being foure or fiue
inches high, bearing at the toppe three or foure small green leaues,
and among them foure or fiue small yellow starre-like flowers, with a
greenish line or streake downe the backe of euery leafe, and some small
reddish yellow threeds in the middle: it seldome giueth seede: the
roote is round, whitish, and somewhat cleare, very apt to perish, if it
bee any little while kept dry out of the ground, as I haue twice tryed
to my losse.


        The Place.

        The first grew in Portugall, and Clusius first of all others
        desciphers it.

        The other is found in many places both of Germany and Hungary,
        in the moister grounds.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth in May: the other in Aprill, and sometimes
        in March.


        The Names.

        Carolus Clusius calleth the first _Bulbus vnifolius_, or
        _Bolbine_, but referreth it not to the stocke or kindred of any
        plant; but (as you see) I haue ranked it with the small sorts
        of _Ornithogalum_, and giue it the name accordingly.

        The other is referred for likenesse of forme, and not for
        colour, vnto the _Ornithogala_, or Starres of Bethlehem. It is
        called by Tragus and Fuchsius _Bulbus siluestris_, because of
        the obuiousnesse. Cordus taketh it to be _Sisyrinchium_. Lacuna
        calleth it _Bulbus esculentus_. Lobel and others in these
        dayes generally, _Ornithogalum luteum_, and wee thereafter in
        English, The yellow Starre-flower, or Starre of Bethlehem.


        The Vertues.

        The first kinde being but lately found out, is not knowne to be
        vsed. The rootes of the common or vulgar, are (as Matthiolus
        saith) much eaten by poore people in Italy, either rawe or
        roasted, being sweeter in taste then any Chestnut, and seruing
        as well for a necessary food as for delight. It is doubtfull
        whether any of the rest may be so vsed; for I know not any in
        our Land hath made any experience.


There are many other sorts of Starre-flowers, which are fitter for a
generall then this History; and therefore I referre them thereunto.




CHAP. XIII.

_Moly._   Wilde Garlicke.


Vnto the former Starre-flowers, must needes bee ioyned another tribe
or kindred, which carry their straked flowers Starre-fashion, not
spikewise, but in a tuft or vmbell thicke thrust or set together. And
although diuers of them smell not as the former, but most of their
first Grandfathers house, yet all doe not so; for some of them are of
an excellent sent. Of the whole Family, there are a great many which I
must leaue, I will onely select out a few for this our Garden, whose
flowers for their beauty of statelinesse, forme, or colour, are fit to
bee entertained, and take place therein, euery one according to his
worth, and are accepted of with the louers of these delights.


1. _Moly Homericum, vel potius Theophrasti._
The greatest Moly of Homer.

Homers Moly (for so it is most vsually called with vs) riseth vp most
commonly with two, and sometimes with three great, thicke, long, and
hollow guttered leaues, of a whitish greene colour, very neare the
colour of the Tulipa leafe, hauing sometimes at the end of some of the
leaues, and sometimes apart by it selfe, a whitish round small button,
like vnto a small bulbe, the like whereof also, but greater, doth grow
betweene the bottome of the leaues and the stalke neare the ground,
which being planted when it is ripe, will grow into a roote of the same
kinde: among these leaues riseth vp a round, strong, and tall stalke,
a yard high or better, bare or naked vnto the toppe, where it beareth
a great tuft or vmbell of pale purplish flowers, all of them almost
standing vpon equall foot-stalkes, or not one much higher then another,
consisting of fiue leaues a peece, striped downe the backe with a small
pale line, hauing a round head or vmbone with some threeds about it in
the midst: These flowers doe abide a great while blowne before they
vade, which smell not very strong, like any Onion or Garlicke, but of a
faint smell: and after they are past come the seede, which is blacke,
wrapped in white close huskes: the roote groweth very great, sometimes
bigger then any mans closed fist, smelling strong like Garlicke,
whitish on the outside, and greene at the toppe, if it be but a while
bare from the earth about it.


2. _Moly Indicum siue Caucason._   The Indian Moly.

The Indian Moly hath such like thicke large leaues, as the Homers
Moly hath, but shorter and broader, in the middle whereof riseth vp a
short weake stalke, almost flat, not hauing any flowers vpon it, but a
head or cluster of greenish scaly bulbes, inclosed at the first in a
large thinne skinne, which being open, euery bulbe sheweth it selfe,
standing close one vnto another vpon his foot-stalke, of the bignesse
of an Acorne, which being planted, will grow to bee a plant of his
owne kinde: the roote is white and great, couered with a darke coate
or skinne, which encreaseth but little vnder ground; but besides that
head, it beareth small bulbes aboue the ground, at the bottome of the
leaues next vnto the stalke, like vnto the former.


        The Place.

        Both these doe grow in diuers places of Spaine, Italy, and
        Greece; for the last hath been sent out of Turkie among
        other rootes. Ferrantes Imperatus a learned Apothecary of
        Naples, sent it to diuers of his friends in these parts,
        and hath described it in his naturall history among other
        plants, printed in the Italian tongue. It grew also with Iohn
        Tradescante at Canterbury, who sent me the head of bulbes to
        see, and afterwards a roote, to plant it in my Garden.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth in the end of May, and abideth vnto the
        midst of Iuly, and sometimes longer. The other beareth his head
        of bulbes in Iune and Iuly.


        The Names.

        We haue receiued them by their names expressed in their titles,
        yet the last hath also been sent by the name of _Ornithogalum
        Italicum_, but as all may easily see, it is not of that kindred.


1. _Moly montanum Pannonicum bulbiferum primum._
The first bulbed Moly of Hungary.

This first Hungarian Moly hath three or foure broad and long greene
leaues, folded together at the first, which after open themselues, and
are carried vp with the stalke, standing thereon one aboue another,
which is a foote high; at the toppe whereof doe grow a few sad reddish
bulbes, and betweene them long footstalkes, bearing flowers of a pale
purplish colour; after which followeth blacke seede, inclosed in
roundish heads: the roote is not great, but white on the outside, very
like vnto the roote of Serpents Moly, hereafter described, encreasing
much vnder ground, & smelling strong.


2. _Moly montanum Pannonicum bulbiferum secundum._
The second bulbed Moly of Hungary.

The second Moly hath narrower greene leaues then the former: the stalke
is about the same height, and beareth at the toppe a great cluster of
small greene bulbes, which after turne of a darker colour; from among
which come forth long foot-stalks, whereon stand purplish flowers: the
roote is couered with a blackish purple coate or skinne.


3. _Moly Serpentinum._   Serpents Moly.

This Moly must also be ioyned vnto the bulbous Molyes, as of kindred
with them, yet of greater beauty and delight, because the bulbes on the
heads of the small stalkes are redder, and more pleasant to behold: the
stalke is lower, and his grassie winding leaues, which turne themselues
(whereof it tooke the name) are smaller, and of a whiter greene colour:
it beareth among the bulbes purplish flowers also, but more beautifull,
the sent whereof is nothing so strong: the roote is small, round, and
whitish, encreasing into a number of small rootes, no bigger then pease
round about the greater roote.


4. _Moly caule & folijs triangularibus._   The three cornered Moly.

This three square Moly hath foure or fiue long, and somewhat broad
pale greene leaues, flat on the vpper side, and with a ridge downe the
backe of the leafe, which maketh it seeme three square: the stalke
which riseth vp a foote and a halfe high or better, is three square or
three cornered also, bearing at the toppe out of a skinnie huske diuers
white flowers, somewhat large and long, almost bell-fashion, with
stripes of greene downe the middle of euery leafe, and a few chiues
tipt with yellow in the middle about the head, wherein when it is ripe,
is inclosed small blacke seede: the roote is white on the outside, and
very like the yellow Moly; both roote, leafe, and flower hath a smacke,
but not very strong of Garlicke.

]


5. _Moly Narcissinis folijs._   Daffodill leafed Moly.

This Moly hath many long, narrow, and flat greene leaues, very like
vnto the leaues of a Daffodill, from whence it tooke his name (or
rather of the early greater _Leucoium_ _bulbosum_, or bulbed Violet
before described, ioyned next vnto the Daffodils, because it is so like
them) among which riseth vp two or three stalkes sometimes, each of a
foot and a halfe high, bearing at the toppe, inclosed in a skinny hose,
as all the Molyes haue, a number of small purplish flowers, which doe
not long abide, but quickly fade: the seede is blacke as others are;
the roote is sometimes knobbed, and more often bulbed, hauing in the
knobs some markes of the old stalkes to be seene in them, and smelleth
somewhat like Garlicke, whereby it may be knowne.


6. _Moly montanum latifolium luteo flore._   The yellow Moly.

The yellow Moly hath but one long and broad leafe when it doth not
beare flower, but when it will beare flower, it hath two long and
broad leaues, yet one alwaies longer and broader then the other, which
are both of the same colour, and neare the bignesse of a reasonable
Tulipa leafe: betweene these leaues groweth a slender stalke, bearing
at the toppe a tuft or vmbell of yellow flowers out of a skinnie hose,
which parteth three wayes, made of six leaues a peece, laid open like
a Starre, with a greenish backe or outside, and with some yellow
threeds in the middle: the seede is blacke, like vnto others: the roote
is whitish, two for the most part ioyned together, which encreaseth
quickly, and smelleth very strong of Garlicke, as both flowers and
leaues doe also.


7. _Moly Pyrenæum purpureum._   The purple mountaine Moly.

This purple Moly hath two or three leaues, somewhat like the former
yellow Moly, but not so broad, nor so white: the stalke hath not so
many flowers thereon, but more sparingly, and of an vnpleasant purple
colour: the roote is whitish, smelling somewhat strongly of Garlicke,
but quickly perisheth with the extremity of our cold Winters, which it
will not abide vnlesse it be defended.


8. _Moly montanum latifolium purpureum Hispanicum._
The purple Spanish Moly.

This Moly hath two broad and very long greene leaues, like vnto the
yellow Moly, in this, that they doe compasse one another at the bottome
of them, between which riseth vp a strong round stalke, two foote high
or more, bearing at the toppe, out of a thinne huske, a number of faire
large flowers vpon long foot-stalkes, consisting of six leaues a peece,
spread open like a Starre, of a fine delayed purple or blush colour,
with diuers threeds of the same colour, tipt with yellow, standing
about the middle head: betweene the stalke and the bottome of the
leaues it hath some small bulbes growing, which being planted, will
soone spring and encrease: the roote also being small and round, with
many fibres thereat, hath many small bulbes shooting from them; but
neither roote, leafe, nor flower, hath any ill sent of Garlicke at all.


9. _Moly purpureum Neapolitanum._   The purple Moly of Naples.

The Neapolitane Moly hath three of foure small long greene leaues set
vpon the stalke after it is risen vp, which beareth a round head of
very fine purple flowers, made of six leaues a peece, but so closing
together at the edge, that they seeme like vnto small cuppes, neuer
laying themselues open, as the other doe; this hath some sent of his
originall, but the roote more then any part else, which is white and
round, quickly encreasing as most of the Molyes doe.


10. _Moly pyxidatum argenteum Hispanicum._
The Spanish siluer cupped Moly.

This Spanish Moly hath two or three very long rush like leaues, which
rise vp with the stalke, or rather vanish away when the stalke is risen
vp to bee three foote high or more, bearing a great head of flowers,
standing close at the first, but afterwards spreading much one from
another, euery flower vpon a long foote-stalke, being of a white
siluer colour, with stripes or lines on euery side, and fashioned small
and hollow, like a cuppe or boxe: the seede I could neuer obserue,
because it flowreth so late, that the Winter hindereth it from bearing
seede with vs: the roote is small and round, white, and in a manner
transparent, at least so shining, as if it were so, and encreaseth
nothing so much, as many of the other sorts: this hath no ill sent at
all, but rather a pretty smell, not to bee misliked.


11. _Moly serotinum Coniferum._   The late Pineapple Moly.

This late Moly that was sent me with the last described, and others
also from Spain, riseth vp with one long greene leafe, hollow and round
vnto the end, towards this end on the one side, breaketh out a head
of flowers, enclosed in a thinne skinne, which after it hath so stood
a good while, (the leafe in the meane time rising higher, and growing
harder, becommeth the stalke) breaketh, and sheweth a great bush or
head of buds for flowers, thicke thrust together, fashioned very like
vnto the forme of a Pineapple (from whence I gaue it the name) of the
bigness of a Walnut: after this head hath stood in this manner a moneth
or thereabouts, the flowers shew themselues to bee of a fine delayed
or whitish purple colour, with diuers stripes in euery of them, of
the same cup-fashion with the former, but not opening so plainly, so
that they cannot bee discerned to bee open, without good heede and
obseruation. It flowreth so late in Autume, that the early frosts doe
quickly spoile the beauty of it, and soone cause it to rotte: the roote
is small and round, and shining like the last, very tender also, as
not able to abide our sharpe Winters, which hath caused it vtterly to
perish with me.


12. _Moly Dioscorideum._   Dioscorides his Moly.

The roote of this small Moly is transparent within, but couered with a
thicke yellowish skinne, of the bignesse of an Hasell Nut, or somewhat
bigger, which sendeth forth three or foure narrow grassie leaues, long
and hollow, and a little bending downwards, of a whitish greene colour,
among which riseth vp a slender weake stalke, a foot and a halfe high,
bearing at the toppe, out of a thinne skinne, a tuft of milke white
flowers, very like vnto those of Ramsons, which stand a pretty while in
their beauty, and then passe away for the most part without giuing any
seede: this hath little or no sent of Garlicke.

We haue anothor of this sort that is lesser, and the flowers rounder
pointed.


13. _Moly Dioscorideum Hispanicum._   The Spanish Moly of Dioscorides.

This Moly came vnto me among other Molyes from Spaine, and is in all
things like vnto the last described, but fairer, larger, and of much
more beauty, as hauing his white flowers twice as great as the former;
but (as it seemeth) very impatient of our Winters, which it could not
at any hand endure, but quickly perished, as some others that came with
it also.


14. _Moly Moschatinum vel Zibettinum Monspeliense._
The sweete smelling Moly of Mompelier.

This sweete Moly, which I haue kept for the last, to close vp your
senses, is the smallest, and the finest of all the rest, hauing foure
or fiue small greene leaues, almost as fine as haires, or like the
leaues of the Feather-grasse: the stalke is about a foote high, bearing
fiue or six or more small white flowers, laid open like Starres, made
of six leaues a peece, of an excellent sweete sent, resembling Muske or
Ciuet; for diuers haue diuersly censured of it. It flowreth late in the
yeare, so that if the precedent Summer bee either ouer moist, or the
Autumne ouer early cold, this will not haue that sweete sent, that it
will haue in a hot drie time, and besides must be carefully respected:
for it will hardly abide the extremity of our sharpe Winters.


        The Place.

        The places of these Molyes, are for the most part expressed in
        their titles, or in their descriptions.


        The Time.

        The time is set downe, for the most part to bee in Iune and
        Iuly, the rest later.


        The Names.

        To make further relation of names then are expressed in their
        titles, were needlesse; let these therefore suffice.


        The Vertues.

        All these sorts of Molyes are small kindes of wilde Garlicke,
        and are to be vsed for the same purposes that the great Garden
        Garlicke is, although much weaker in their effects. For any
        other especiall property is in any of these, more than to
        furnish a Garden of variety, I haue not heard at all.

And thus much may suffice of these kindes for our Garden, reseruing
manie others that might be spoken of, to a generall worke, or to my
Garden of Simples, which as God shall enable me, and time giue leaue,
may shew it selfe to the world, to abide the iudicious and criticke
censures of all.




CHAP. XIIII.

_Asphodelus._   The Asphodill.


There remaine some other flowers, like vnto the last described, to be
specified, which although they haue no bulbous rootes, yet I thinke
them fittest to bee here mentioned, that so I may ioyne those of
neerest similitude together, vntill I haue finished the rest that are
to follow.


1. _Asphodelus maior albus ramosus._
The great white branched Asphodill.

The great white Asphodill hath many long, and narrow, hollow three
square leaues, sharpe pointed, lying vpon the ground round about the
roote: the stalke is smooth, round, and naked without leaues, which
riseth from the midst of them, diuided at the toppe into diuers
branches, if the plant bee of any long continuance, or else but into
two or three small branches, from the sides of the maine great one,
whereon doe stand many large flowers Starre-fashion, made of six leaues
a peece, whitish on the inside, and straked with a purplish line downe
the backside of euery leafe, hauing in the middle of the flowers some
small yellow threeds: the seede is blacke, and three square, greater
then the seede of Bucke wheate, contained in roundish heads, which open
into three parts: the roote is composed of many tuberous long clogges,
thickest in the middle, and smaller at both ends, fastened together at
the head, of a darke grayish colour on the outside, and yellow within.


2. _Asphodelus albus non ramosus._   The white vnbranched Asphodill.

The vnbranched Asphodill is like vnto the former, both in leaues and
flowers, but that the flowers of this are whiter, and without any line
or strake on the backe side, and the stalkes are without branches: the
rootes likewise are smaller, and fewer, but made after the same fashion.


3. _Asphodelus maior flore carneo._   The blush coloured Asphodill.

This Asphodill is like to the last in forme of leaues and branches, and
differeth in this, that his leaues are marked with some spots, and the
flowers are of a blush or flesh colour, in all other things alike.


4. _Asphodelus minimus albus._   The least white Asphodill.

This least Asphodill hath foure or fiue very narrow long leaues, yet
seeming three square like the greatest, bearing a small stalke, of
about a foote high among them, without any branches, and at the toppe
a few white flowers, straked both within and without, with a purplish
line in the middle of euery leafe. The rootes are such like tuberous
clogges as are in the former, but much lesser.


5. _Asphodelus albus minor siue Fistulosus._
The little hollow white Asphodill.

This little white Asphodill hath a number of leaues growing thicke
together, thicker and greener then those of the small yellow Asphodill,
or Kings Speare next following, among which riseth vp diuers round
stalkes, bearing flowers from the middle to the toppe, Starre-fashion,
with small greene leaues among them, which are white on the inside, and
striped on the backe with purple lines like vnto the first described:
the seede, and heads containing them, are three square, like the seede
of the little yellow Asphodill: the rootes of this kinde are not
glandulous, as the former, but stringie, long and white: the whole
plant is very impatient of our cold Winters, and quickly perisheth, if
it be not carefully preserued, both from the cold, and much wet in the
Winter, by housing it; and then it will abide many yeares: for it is
not an annuall plant, as many haue thought.


6. _Asphodelus luteus minor, siue Hastula regia._
The small yellow Asphodill, or Kings speare.

This small yellow Asphodill, which is vsually called the Kings speare,
hath many long narrow edged leaues, which make them seeme three square,
of a bluish or whitish greene colour: the stalke riseth vp three foote
high oftentimes, beset with small long leaues vp vnto the very flowers,
which grow thicke together spike-fashion one aboue another, for a great
length, and wholly yellow, laid open like a Starre, somewhat greater
then the last white Asphodill, and smaller then the first, which when
they are past yeeld round heads, containing blacke cornered seede,
almost three square: the rootes are many long yellow strings, which
spreading in the ground, doe much encrease.


        The Place.

        All these Asphodils doe grow naturally in Spaine and France,
        and from thence were first brought vnto vs, to furnish our
        Gardens.


        The Time.

        All the glandulous rooted Asphodils doe flower some in May,
        and some in Iune; but the two last doe flower, the yellow or
        last, of them in Iuly, and the former white one in August and
        September, and vntill the cold and winter hinder it.


        The Names.

        Their seuerall names are giuen them in their titles, as much as
        is fit for this discourse. For to shew you that the Greekes
        doe call the stalke of the great Asphodill Ανθερίκη, and the
        Latines _Albucum_, or what else belongeth to them, is fitter
        for another worke, vnto which I leaue them.


The bastard Asphodils should follow next in place, if this worke were
fit for them; but because I haue tyed my selfe to expresse onely
those flowers and plants, that for their beauty, or sent, or both,
doe furnish a Garden of Pleasure, and they haue none, I leaue them
to a generall History of plants, or that Garden of Simples before
spoken of, and will describe the Lilly Asphodils, and the _Phalangia_
or Spider-worts, which are remaining of those, that ioyne in name or
fashion, and are to be here inserted, before I passe to the rest of the
bulbous rootes.


1. _Liliasphodelus phœniceus._   The gold red Day Lilly.

Because the rootes of this and the next, doe so nearely agree with the
two last recited Asphodils, I haue set them in this place, although
some doe place them next after the Lillies, because their flowers doe
come nearest in forme vnto Lillies; but whether you will call them
Asphodils with Lilly flowers, as I thinke it fittest, or Lillies with
Asphodill rootes, or Lillies without bulbous rootes, as others doe, I
will not contend.

The red Day Lilly hath diuers broad and long fresh greene leaues,
folded at the first as it were double, which after open, and remaine a
little hollow in the middle; among which riseth vp a naked stalke three
foot high, bearing at the toppe many flowers, one not much distant from
another, and flowring one after another, not hauing lightly aboue one
flower blown open in a day, & that but for a day, not lasting longer,
but closing at night, and not opening againe; whereupon it had his
English name, The Lilly for a day: these flowers are almost as large as
the flowers of the white Lilly, and made after the same fashion, but
of a faire gold red, or Orange tawny colour. I could neuer obserue any
seede to follow these flowers; for they seeme the next day after they
haue flowred, (except the time be faire and dry) to bee so rotten, as
if they had lyen in wet to rotte them, whereby I thinke no seede can
follow: the rootes are many thicke and long yellow knobbed strings,
like vnto the small yellow Asphodill rootes, but somewhat greater,
running vnder ground in like sort, and shooting young heads round about.


2. _Liliasphodelus luteus._   The yellow Day Lilly.

I shall not neede to make a repetition of the description of this
Day Lilly, hauing giuen you one so amply before, because this doth
agree thereunto so nearely, as that it might seeme the same; these
differences onely it hath, the leaues are not fully so large, nor the
flower so great or spread open, and the colour thereof is of a faire
yellow wholly, and very sweet, which abideth blowne many daies before
it fade, and hath giuen blacke round seede, growing in round heads,
like the heads of the small yellow Asphodill, but not so great.

Clusius hath set downe, that it was reported, that there should be
another Liliasphodill with a white flower, but we can heare of none
such as yet; but I rather thinke, that they that gaue that report
might be mistaken, in thinking the Sauoye Spider-wort to be a white
Liliasphodill, which indeede is so like, that one not well experienced,
or not well regarding it, may soone take one for another.

   4 _Liliasphodelus luteus._ The yellow Day Lilly.
   5 _Liliasphodelus phœniceus._ The gold red Day Lilly.
]


        The Place.

        Their originall is many moist places in Germany.


        The Time.

        They flower in May and Iune.


        The Names.

        They are called by some _Liliago_, and _Lilium non bulbosum_,
        and _Liliasphodelus_. In English we call them both Day
        Lillies, but the name doth not so well agree with the last, as
        with the first, for the causes aboue specified.


        The Vertues.

        The rootes of Asphodill haue formerly beene had in great
        account, but now are vtterly neglected; yet by reason of their
        sharpnesse they open and cleanse, and therefore some haue of
        late vsed them for the yellow Iaundise. The Day Lillies haue no
        physicall vse that I know, or haue heard.




CHAP. XV.

_Phalangium._   Spider-wort.


These plants doe so nearely resemble those that are last set forth,
that I thinke none that knowes them, will doubt, but that they must
follow next vnto them, being so like vnto them, and therefore of the
fairest of this kinde first.


1. _Phalangium Allobrogicum._   The Sauoye Spider-wort.

The Sauoye Spider-wort springeth vp with foure or fiue greene leaues,
long and narrow, yet broader at the bottome, narrower pointed at the
end, and a little hollow in the middle; among which riseth vp a round
stiffe stalke, a foote and a halfe high, bearing at the toppe one aboue
another, seuen or eight, or more flowers, euery one as large almost
as the yellow Day Lilly last described, but much greater then in any
other of the Spider-worts, of a pure white colour, with some threeds in
the middle, tipt with yellow, and a small forked pointell: after the
flowers are past, the heads or seede vessels grow almost three square,
yet somewhat round, wherein is contained blackish seede: the rootes
are many white, round, thicke, brittle strings, ioyned together at the
head, but are nothing so long, as the rootes of the other _Phalangia_
or Spider-worts.


2. _Phalangium maius Italicum album._   The great Italian Spider-wort.

This great Spider-wort hath diuers long and narrow leaues spread vpon
the ground, and not rising vp as the former, and not so broad also as
the former, but somewhat larger then those that follow: the stalke is
bigger, but seldome riseth vp so high as the next, whereof this is a
larger kinde, hauing a long vnbranched stalke of white flowers, laid
open like starres as it hath, but somewhat greater: the rootes are long
and white, like the next, but somewhat larger.


3. _Phalangium non ramosum vulgare._ Vnbranched Spider-wort.

The leaues of this Spider-wort doe seeme to bee little bigger or longer
then the leaues of grasse, but of a more grayish green colour, rising
immediately from the head or tuft of rootes; among which rise vp one or
two stalkes, sometimes two or three foote long, beset toward the toppe
with many white Starre-like flowers, which after they are past turne
into small round heads, containing blacke seede, like vnto the seed
of the little yellow Asphodill, but lesser: the rootes are long white
strings, running vnder ground.


4. _Phalangium ramosum._   Branched Spider-wort.

The branched Spider-wort hath his leaues somewhat broader then the
former, and of a more yellowish greene colour: the stalke hereof is
diuersly branched at the top, bearing many white flowers, like vnto the
former, but smaller: the seedes and rootes are like the former in all
things.


[Illustration:

   1 _Phalangium Allobrogicum._ The Sauoye Spider-wort.
   2 _Phalangium non ramosum._ Vnbranched Spider-wort.
   3 _Phalangium ramosum._ Branched Spider-wort.
   4 _Phalangium Ephemerum Virginianum._ Iohn Tradescante’s
        Spider-wort.
]


        The Place.

        The first groweth on the Hils neare vnto Sauoye, from whence
        diuers, allured with the beauty of the flower, haue brought it
        into these parts.

        The second came vp in my Garden, from the seede receiued out of
        Italy. The others grow in Spaine, France, &c.


        The Time.

        The vnbranched Spider-wort most commonly flowreth before all
        the other, and the branched a moneth after it: the other two
        about one time, that is, towards the end of May, and not much
        after the vnbranched kinde.


        The Names.

        The first (as I said before) hath beene taken to be a white
        Lilliasphodill, and called _Liliasphodelus flore albo_; but
        Clusius hath more properly entituled it a _Phalangium_,
        and from the place of his originall, gaue him his other
        denomination, and so is called of most, as is set downe in the
        title.

        The other haue no other names then are expressed in their
        titles, but only that Cordus calleth them _Liliago_; and
        Dodonæus, _lib._ 4. _hist. plant._ would make the branched
        kinde to bee _Moly alterum Plinij_, but without any good
        ground.


        The Vertues.

        The names _Phalangium_ and _Phalangites_ were imposed on
        these plants, because they were found effectual, to cure the
        poyson of that kinde of Spider, called _Phalangium_, as also
        of Scorpions and other Serpents. Wee doe not know, that any
        Physitian hath vsed them to any such, or any other purpose in
        our dayes.


5. _Phalangium Ephemerum Virginianum Ioannis Tradescant._
The soon fading Spider-wort of Virginia, or Tradescant his Spider-wort.

This Spider-wort is of late knowledge, and for it the Christian world
is indebted vnto that painfull industrious searcher, and louer of all
natures varieties, Iohn Tradescant (sometimes belonging to the right
Honourable Lord Robert Earle of Salisbury, Lord Treasurer of England
in his time, and then vnto the right Honourable the Lord Wotton at
Canterbury in Kent, and lastly vnto the late Duke of Buckingham)
who first receiued it of a friend, that brought it out of Virginia,
thinking it to bee the Silke Grasse that groweth there, and hath
imparted hereof, as of many other things, both to me and others; the
description whereof is as followeth:

From a stringie roote, creeping farre vnder ground, and rising vp
againe in many places, springeth vp diuers heads of long folded leaues,
of a grayish ouer-worne greene colour, two or three for the most part
together, and not aboue, compassing one another at the bottome, and
abiding greene in many places all the Winter; other-where perishing,
and rising anew in the Spring, which leaues rise vp with the great
round stalke, being set thereon at the ioynts, vsually but one at a
ioynt, broad at the bottome where they compasse the stalke, and smaller
and smaller to the end: at the vpper ioynt, which is the toppe of the
stalke, there stand two or three such like leaues, but smaller, from
among which breaketh out a dozen, sixteene, or twenty, or more round
green heads, hanging downe their heads by little foot-stalkes, which
when the flower beginneth to blow open, groweth longer, and standeth
vpright, hauing three small pale greene leaues for a huske, and three
other leaues within them for the flower, which lay themselues open
flat, of a deepe blew purple colour, hauing an vmbone or small head in
the middle, closely set about with six reddish, hairy, or feathered
threeds, tipt with yellow pendents: this flower openeth it selfe in
the day, & shutteth vsually at night, and neuer openeth againe, but
perisheth, and then hangeth downe his head againe; the greene huske of
three leaues, closing it selfe againe into the forme of a head, but
greater, as it was before, the middle vmbone growing to bee the seede
vessell, wherein is contained small, blackish, long seede: Seldome
shall any man see aboue one, or two at the most of these flowers blowne
open at one time vpon the stalke, whereby it standeth in flowring a
long time, before all the heads haue giuen out their flowers.


        The Place.

        This plant groweth in some parts of Virginia, and was deliuered
        to Iohn Tradescant.


        The Time.

        It flowreth from the end of May vntill Iuly, if it haue had
        greene leaues all the Winter, or otherwise, vntill the Winter
        checke his luxuriousnesse.


        The Names.

        Vnto this plant I confesse I first imposed the name, by
        considering duely all the parts thereof, which vntill some can
        finde a more proper, I desire may still continue, and to call
        it _Ephemerum Virginianum Tradescanti_, Iohn Tradescante’s
        Spider-wort of Virginia, or _Phalangium Ephemerum Virginianum_,
        The soone fading or Day Spider-wort of Virginia.


        The Vertues.

        There hath not beene any tryall made of the properties since
        wee had it, nor doe we know whether the Indians haue any vse
        thereof.




CHAP. XVI.

_Colchicum._   Medowe Saffron.


To returne to the rest of the bulbous and tuberous rooted plants, that
remaine to bee entreated of, the _Colchica_ or Medowe Saffrons are
first to bee handled, whereof these later dayes haue found out more
varieties, then formerly were knowne; some flowring in the Spring, but
the most in Autumne, and some bearing double, but the greatest part
single flowers: whereof euery one in their order, and first of our owne
Country kindes.


1. _Colchicum Anglicum album._   The white English Medowe Saffron.

It is common to all the Medowe Saffrons, except that of the Spring, and
one other, to beare their flowers alone in Autumne or later, without
any green leaues with them, and afterwards in February, their greene
leaues: So that I shall not neede to make manie descriptions, but
to shew you the differences that consist in the leaues, and colours
of the flowers; and briefly to passe (after I haue giuen you a full
description of the first) from one vnto another, touching onely those
things that are note worthy. The white English Medowe Saffron then doth
beare in Autumne three or foure flowers at the most, standing seuerally
vpon weake foote-stalkes, a fingers length or more aboue the ground,
made of six white leaues, somewhat long and narrow, and not so large as
most of the other kindes, with some threeds or chiues in the middle,
like vnto the Saffron flowers of the Spring, wherein there is no colour
of Saffron, or vertue to that effect: after the flowers are past and
gone, the leaues doe not presently follow, but the roote remaineth in
the ground without shew of leafe aboue ground, most part of the Winter,
and then in February there spring vp three or foure large and long
greene leaues, when they are fully growne vp, standing on the toppe of
a round, weake, green, and short foote-stalke, somewhat like the leaues
of white Lillies, but not so large, and in the middest of these leaues,
after they haue been vp some time, appeare two or three loose skinny
heads, standing in the middle of the leaues vpon short, thicke, greene
stalkes, and being ripe, conteine in them round small brownish seede,
that lye as it were loose therein, and when the head is dry, may bee
heard to rattle being shaken: the roote is white within, but couered
with a thicke blackish skinne or coate, hauing one side thereof at the
bottome longer then the other, with an hollownesse also on the one
side of that long eminence, where the flowers rise from the bottome,
and shooting downe from thence a number of white fibres, whereby it is
fastened in the ground: the greene leaues afterwards rising from the
top or head of the roote.


2. _Colchicum Anglicum purpureum._   The purple English Medowe Saffron.

There is no difference at all in this Medowe Saffron from the former,
but only in the colour of the flowers, which as they were wholly white
in the former, so in this they are of a delayed purple colour, with a
small shew of veines therein.


3. _Colchicum Pannonicum album._   The white Hungary Medowe Saffron.

The greatest difference in this _Colchicum_ from the former English
white one, is, that it is larger both in roote, leafe, and flower, and
besides, hath more store of flowers together, and continuing longer in
beauty, without fading so soone as the former, and are also somewhat of
a fairer white colour.


4. _Colchicum Pannonicum purpureum._
The purple Hungary Medowe Saffron.

This purple Medowe Saffron is somewhat like vnto the white of this
kinde, but that it beareth not so plentifully as the white, nor doth
the roote grow so great; but the flowers are in a manner as large as
they, and of the like pale delayed purple colour, or somewhat deeper,
as is in the purple English, with some veines or markes vpon the
flowers, making some shew of a checker on the out side, but not so
conspicuous, as in the true checkerd kindes. Wee haue a kinde hereof is
party coloured with white streakes and edges, which abide constant, and
hath been raised from the seede of the former.


5. _Colchicum Byzantinum._   Medowe Saffron of Constantinople.

This Medowe Saffron of Constantinople hath his leaues so broad and
large, that hardly could any that neuer saw it before, iudge it to be
a _Colchicum_; for they are much larger then any Lilly leaues, and of
a darke greene colour: the flowers are correspondent to the leaues,
larger and more in number then in any of the former purple kindes, of
the same colour with the last purple kinde, but of a little deeper
purple on the inside, with diuers markes running through the flowers,
like vnto it, or vnto checkers, but yet somewhat more apparently: the
roote is in the middle greater and rounder then the others, with a
longer eminence, whereby it may easily bee knowne from all other sorts.


6. _Colchicum Lusitanicum Fritillaricum._
The checkerd Medowe Saffron of Portugall.

The flowers of this Medowe Saffron are larger and longer then the
flowers of either the English or Hungarian, and almost as large as the
last before mentioned, and of the same colour, but a little deeper, the
spots and markes whereof are somewhat more easie to be seene euen a
farre off, like vnto the flower of a Fritillaria, from whence it tooke
his significatiue name: the leaues of this Medowe Saffron doe rise vp
sooner then in any other of the Autumne kindes, for they are alwayes vp
before Winter, and are foure or fiue in number, short rather then long,
broad belowe, and pointed at the end, canaled or hollow, and standing
round aboue the ground, one encompassing another at the bottome, like
the great Spanish Starre Iacinth, called the Iacinth of Peru, but
shorter, and of a pale or grayish greene colour, differing from the
colour of all the other Medowe Saffrons: the roote is like the roote of
the English or Hungarian without any difference, but that it groweth
somewhat greater. It is one of the first Medowe Saffrons that flower in
the Autumne.

        of Portugall.

        Saffron of Naples.

        Chio or Sio.
   6 _Colchicum Hermodactylum._ Physicall Medowe Saffron.
]


7. _Colchicum Neapolitanum Fritillaricum._
The checkerd Medowe Saffron of Naples.

This checkerd Medowe Saffron of Naples, is very like vnto the last
recited checkerd Saffron of Portugall, but that the flower is somewhat
larger, yet sometimes very little, or not at all: the greatest marke to
distinguish them is, that the flowers of this are of a deeper colour,
and so are the spots on the flowers likewise, which are so conspicuous,
that they are discerned a great way off, more like vnto the flowers of
a deepe Fritillaria, then the former, and make a goodlier and a more
glorious shew: the leaues of this doe rise vp early after the flowers,
and are somewhat longer, of a darker greene colour, yet bending to a
grayish colour as the other, not lying so neatly or round, but stand
vp one by another, being as it were folded together: neither of both
these last named checkerd Medowe Saffrons haue giuen any seede in this
Countrey, that euer I could learne or heare of, but are encreased by
the roote, which in this is like the former, but a little bigger.


8. _Colchicum Fritillaricum Chiense._
The checkerd Medowe Saffron of Chio or Sio.

This most beautifull Saffron flower riseth vp with his flowers in the
Autumne, as the others before specified doe, although not of so large
a size, yet farre more pleasant and delightfull in the thicke, deepe
blew, or purple coloured beautifull spots therein, which make it excell
all others whatsoeuer: the leaues rise vp in the Spring, being smaller
then the former, for the most part three in number, and of a paler
or fresher greene colour, lying close vpon the ground, broad at the
bottome, a little pointed at the end, and twining or folding themselues
in and out at the edges, as if they were indented. I haue not seene any
seede it hath borne: the roote is like vnto the others of this kinde,
but small and long, and not so great: it flowreth later for the most
part then any of the other, euen not vntill Nouember, and is very hard
to be preserued with vs, in that for the most part the roote waxeth
lesse and lesse euery yeare, our cold Country being so contrary vnto
his naturall, that it will scarce shew his flower; yet when it flowreth
any thing early, that it may haue any comfort of a warme Sunne, it is
the glorie of all these kindes.


9. _Colchicum versicolor._   The party coloured Medowe Saffron.

The flowers of this Medowe Saffron most vsually doe not appeare, vntill
most of the other Autumne sorts are past, except the last, which are
very lowe, scarce rising with their stalkes three fingers breadth
aboue the ground, but oftentimes halfe hid within the ground: the
leaues whereof are smaller, shorter, and rounder, then in any of the
other before specified, some being altogether white, and others wholly
of a very pale purple, or flesh colour; and some againe parted, the
one halfe of a leafe white, and the other halfe of the same purple,
and sometimes striped purple and white, in diuers leaues of one and
the same flower: and againe, some will be the most part of the leafe
white, and the bottome purple, thus varying as nature list, that
many times from one roote may bee seene to arise all these varieties
before mentioned: these flowers doe stand long before they fade and
passe away; for I haue obserued in my Garden some that haue kept their
flower faire vntill the beginning of Ianuary, vntill the extremitie
of the Winter frosts and snowes haue made them hide their heads: the
leaues therefore accordingly doe rise vp after all other, and are of
a brownish or darke greene colour at their first springing vp, which
after grow to be of a deepe greene colour: the roote is like the former
English or Hungarian kindes, but thicker and greater for the most part,
and shorter also.


10. _Colchicum variegatum alterum._
Another party coloured Medowe Saffron.

There is another, whose party coloured flowers rise a little higher,
diuersly striped and marked, with a deeper purple colour, and a pale or
whitish blush throughout all the leaues of the flower.


11. _Colchicum montanum Hispanicum minus._
The little Spanish Medowe Saffron.

The flowers of this little Medowe Saffron are narrower and smaller then
any of the former, and of a deeper reddish purple colour then either
the English or Hungarian kindes: the greene leaues also are smaller
then any other, lying on the ground, of a deepe or sad greene colour,
rising vp within a while after the flowers are past, and doe abide
greene all the Winter long: the roote is small and long, according to
the rest of the plant, and like in forme to the others.


12. _Colchicum montanum minus versicolore flore._
The small party coloured Medowe Saffron.

This little kinde differeth not from the Spanish kinde last set forth,
but in the varietie of the flower, which is as small as the former; the
three inner leaues being almost all white, and the three outer leaues
some of them pale or blush, and some party coloured, with a little
greene on the backe of some of them.


13. _Colchicum Hermodactilum._   Physicall Medowe Saffron.

This Physicall Medowe Saffron springeth vp with his leaues in Autumne,
before his flowers appeare beyond the nature of all the former kindes,
yet the flower doth, after they are vp, shew it selfe in the middle of
the greene leaues, consisting of six white leaues, with diuers chiues
in the middle, and passeth away without giuing any seede that euer
I could obserue: the greene leaues abide all the Winter and Spring
following, decaying about May, and appeare not vntill September, when
(as I said) the flowers shew themselues presently after the leaues are
sprung vp.


14. _Colchicum atropurpureum._   The darke purple Medowe Saffron.

The greatest difference in this kinde consisteth in the flower, which
at the first appearing is as pale a purple, as the flower of the former
Hungarian kinde: but after it hath stood in flower two or three dayes,
it beginneth to change, and will after a while become to bee of a very
deepe reddish purple colour, as also the little foote-stalke whereon it
doth stand: the flower is of the bignesse of the Hungarian purple, and
so is the greene leafe: the seede and roote is like the English purple
kinde.


15. _Colchicum atropurpureum variegatum._
The party coloured darke purple Medowe Saffron.

We haue of late gained another sort of this kinde, differing chiefly
in the flower, which is diuersly striped thorough euery leafe of the
flower, with a paler purple colour, whereby the flower is of great
beauty: this might seeme to bee a degeneration from the former, yet
it hath abiden constant with me diuers yeares, and giueth seede as
plentifully as the former.


16. _Colchicum flore pleno._   Double flowred Medowe Saffron.

The double Medowe Saffron is in roote and leafe very like unto the
English kinde: the flowers are of a fine pale or delayed purple colour,
consisting of many leaues set thicke together, which are somewhat
smaller, as in the English flower, being narrow and long, and as it
were round at the points, which make a very double flower, hauing some
chiues with their yellow tips, dispersed as it were among the leaues in
the middle: it flowreth in September, a little after the first shew of
the earlier Medowe Saffrons are past.


17. _Colchicum variegatum pleno flore._
The party coloured double Medowe Saffron.

We haue another of these double kinds (if it be not the very same with
the former, varying in the flower as nature pleaseth oftentimes; for
I haue this flower in my garden, as I here set it forth, euery yeare)
whose flowers are diuersified in the partition of the colours, as is to
be seene in the single party coloured Medowe Saffron before described,
hauing some leaues white, and others pale purple, and some leaues halfe
white and halfe purple, diuersly set or placed in the double flower,
which doth consist of as many leaues as the former, yet sometime this
party coloured flower doth not shew it selfe double like the former,
but hath two flowers, one rising out of another, making each of them
to be almost but single flowers, consisting of eight or ten leaues a
peece: but this diuersity is not constant; for the same roote that this
yeare appeareth in that manner, the next yeare will returne to his
former kinde of double flowers againe.


18. _Colchicum Vernum._   Medowe Saffron of the Spring.

This Medowe Saffron riseth vp very early in the yeare, that is, in the
end of Ianuarie sometimes, or beginning, or at the furthest the middle
of February, presently after the deepe Frosts and Snowes are past,
with his flowers inclosed within three greene leaues, which opening
themselues as soone almost as they are out of the ground, shew their
buds for flowers within them very white oftentimes, before they open
farre, and sometimes also purplish at their first appearing, which
neuer shew aboue two at the most vpon one roote, and neuer rise aboue
the leaues, nor the leaues much higher then they, while they last: the
flower consisteth of six leaues, long and narrow, euery leafe being
diuided, both at the bottome and toppe, each from other, and ioyned
together onely in the middle, hauing also six chiues, tipt with yellow
in the middle, euery chiue being ioyned to a leafe, of a pale red or
deepe blush colour, when it hath stood a while blowne, and is a smaller
flower then any Medowe Saffron, except the small Spanish kindes onely,
but continueth in his beauty a good while, if the extremity of sharpe
Frosts and Windes doe not spoile it: the leaues wherein these flowers
are enclosed, at their first comming vp, are of a brownish greene
colour, which so abide for a while, especially on the outside, but on
the inside they are hollow, and of a whitish or grayish greene colour,
which after the flowers are past, grow to bee of the length of a mans
longest finger, and narrow withall: there riseth vp likewise in the
middle of them the head or seede vessell, which is smaller and shorter,
and harder then any of the former, wherein is contained small round
browne seede: the roote is small, somewhat like vnto the rootes of the
former, but shorter, and not hauing so long an eminence on the one side
of the bottome.


19. _Colchicum vernum atropurpureum._
Purple Medowe Saffron of the Spring.

The flower of this Medowe Saffron, is in the rising vp of his leaues
and flowers together, and in all things else, like vnto the former,
onely the flowers of this sort are at their first appearing of a deeper
purple colour, and when they are blowne also are much deeper then the
former, diuided in like manner, both at the bottome and toppe as the
other, so that they seeme, like as if six loose leaues were ioyned in
the middle part, to make one flower, and hath his small chiues tipt
with yellow, cleauing in like manner to euery leafe.

        The Place.

        All these Medowe Saffrons, or the most part of them, haue their
        places expressed in their titles; for some grow in the fields
        and medowes of the champion grounds, others on the mountaines
        and hilly grounds. The English kindes grow in the West parts,
        as about Bathe, Bristow, Warmister, and other places also.
        The double kindes are thought to come out of Germany.


        The Time.

        Their times likewise are declared in their seuerall
        descriptions: those that are earliest in Autumne, flower in
        August and September, the later in October, and the latest in
        the end of October, and in November. The other are said to bee
        of the Spring, in regard they come after the deepe of Winter
        (which is most vsually in December and Ianuary) is past.


        The Names.

        The generall name to all these plants is _Colchicum_, whereunto
        some haue added _Ephemerum_, because it killeth within one
        dayes space; and some _Strangulatorium_. Some haue called them
        also _Bulbus Agrestis_, and _Filius ante Patrem_, The Sonne
        before the Father, because (as they thinke) it giueth seede
        before the flower: but that is without due consideration;
        for the root of this (as of most other bulbous plants) after
        the stalke of leaues and seede are dry, and past, may be
        transplanted, and then it beginneth to spring and giue flowers
        before leaues, (and therein onely it is differing from other
        plants) but the leaues and seede follow successiuely after the
        flowers, before it may be remoued againe; so that here is not
        seede before flowers, but contrarily flowers vpon the first
        planting or springing, and seede after, as in all other plants,
        though in a diuers manner.

        The _Colchicum Hermodactilum_ may seeme very likely to bee
        the _Colchicum Orientale_ of Matthiolus, or the _Colchicum
        Alexandrinum_ of Lobelius: And some thinke it to be the
        true _Hermodactilus_, and so call it, but it is not so. We
        doe generally call them all in English Medowe Saffrons, or
        _Colchicum_, according to the Latine, giuing to euery one his
        other adiunct to know it by.

        The Vertues.

        None of these are vsed for any Physicall respect, being
        generally held to be deadly, or dangerous at the least. Only
        the true Hermodactile (if it be of this tribe, and not this
        which is here expressed) is of great vse, for paines in the
        ioynts, and of the hippes, as the _Sciatica_, and the like,
        to be taken inwardly. Costæus in his Booke of the nature of
        plants, saith, that the rootes of our common kindes are very
        bitter in the Spring of the yeare, and sweet in Autumne, which
        Camerarius contradicteth, saying, that he found them bitter in
        Autumne, which were (as he saith) giuen by some imposters to
        diuers, as an antidote against the Plague.




CHAP. XVII.

_Crocus._   Saffron.


There are diuers sorts of Saffrons, whereof many doe flower in the
Spring time, and some in Autumne, among whom there is but one onely
kinde, that is called tame or of the Garden, which yeeldeth those
blades or chiues that are vsed in meates and medicines, and many wayes
profitable for other respects, none of the rest, which are all wilde
kindes, giuing any blade equall vnto those of the tame kinde, or for
any other vse, then in regard of their beautifull flowers of seuerall
varieties, and as they haue been carefully sought out, and preserued by
diuers, to furnish a Garden of dainty curiosity. To entreate therefore
of these, I must, to obserue an orderly declaration, diuide them into
two primary families: the former shall be of those that yeeld their
pleasant flowers in the Spring of the yeare, and the other that send
out their colours in the Autumne, among whom that _Rex pomarij_ (as
I may so call it) the tame or manured kinde, properly called of the
Garden, is to be comprehended, for that it giueth his pleasant flowers
at that time among others. I shall againe distribute those of the
Spring time into three chiefe colours, that is, into white, purple, and
yellow, and vnder euery one of them, comprehend the seuerall varieties
that doe belong vnto them; which course I will also hold with those of
the Autumne, that thus being rightly ranked, they may the more orderly
be described.


1. _Crocus Vernus albus purus minor._
The smaller pure white Saffron flower of the Spring.

This small Saffron flower springeth vp in the beginning of the yeare,
with three or foure small greene leaues, somewhat broader, but much
shorter then the true Saffron leaues, with a white line downe the
middle of euery leafe: betweene these leaues, out of a white skinne,
riseth vp one or two small flowers, made of six leaues a peece, as all
the rest in generall are, of a pure white colour, without any mixture
in it, which abide not in flower aboue a weeke, or rather lesse, so
sodainly is the pleasure of this, and the purple lost: it flowreth not
for the most part, vntill a moneth after the yellow Crocus appeareth
in flower, and the ordinary stript Crocus is past: the seede is
small, round, and reddish, yet not so red as the seede of the yellow,
contained in three square heads, yet seldome beareth, but encreaseth by
the roote plentifully enough, which is small, round, and flat at the
bottome, somewhat white on the outside, but whiter within, shooting out
small sprouts on euery side of the roote, which is the best note to
know this kinde and the lesser purple, which are both alike, from all
other rootes of Saffron flowers.


2. _Crocus albus maior multiflorus._   The great snow white Crocus.

This greater Saffron flower riseth vp vsually with three or foure
greene leaues, larger then the former, with a white line in euery one
of them: the flowers are greater, and more in number, rising together,
but flowring one after another, of a pure snow white colour, and
abiding but little longer in flower then the former.


3. _Crocus albus maior alter dictus Mæsiacus._
The great white Saffron flower or Crocus of Mesia.

This great white Crocus of Mesia, riseth vp out of the ground, almost
as early as the first sort of the yellow, with foure or fiue leaues,
being very like vnto the leaues of the yellow Crocus, and as large,
with white lines in them: the flowers also are as large as the flowers
of the yellow, and many also rising one after another like vnto it, but
not of so pure a white colour, as the former or last described, but
rather tending to a Milky or Creame colour: the roote is not couered
with any reddish, but rather pale skinnes or coates.


4. _Crocus albus Mæsiacus fundo violaceo._
The great white Crocus of Mesia with a blew bottome.

There is another of this kinde, like vnto the former in all things,
sauing that the bottomes of the flowers of this kinde, with some part
of the stalke next the flower, are of a pale shining purple colour,
and rising vp a pretty way into the flower; whereas another also of
this kind, hath a little shew or marke of blew, and not purple, at the
bottome of the flower onely, which maketh a difference.


5. _Crocus albus fundo purpureo._
The white Crocus with a purple bottome.

This Saffron flower is of the same kinde with the first, both in roote,
leafe, and flower, in none of them differing from it, but in that the
bottome of this flower, with that part of the short foote-stalke next
vnto it, is of violet or purple colour, and sometimes hauing here
and there some purple small lines, or spots on the white leaues: it
flowreth also with the first white, or somewhat later.


6. _Crocus vernus albus striatus._   The white stript Crocus.

This stript Saffron flower is likewise neare the same first kind,
or first white Crocus, hauing the like leaues and flowers, somewhat
larger, but as soone fading almost as it: but herein this flower
differeth, that it hath pale blewish lines and spots in all the leaues
thereof, and more principally in the three outer leaues: the root is
also white on the outside, like the first white, but greater, with
young ones growing round about it.


7. _Crocus vernus albus polyanthos versicolor._
The greater party coloured white Crocus.

The greater party coloured Saffron flower, hath his greene leaues
like vnto the second great white Crocus before mentioned, hauing more
flowers then any of the former, except the first great white, the
leaues whereof haue greater stripes then the last recited Crocus, but
of a purple Violet colour, making each leafe seeme oftentimes to haue
as much purple as white in them: the roote hereof is somewhat like the
second white, but of a little more duskie colour on the outside, and
not budding out on the sides at all, or very little.


8. _Crocus vernus albus versicolor._
The lesser party coloured white Crocus.

The leaues and flowers of this other party coloured Crocus, are for
bignesse in a manner equall with the last, but hath not so many flowers
rising together from the roote: the flower is finely marked with blew
strakes on the white flower, but nothing so much as in the former: the
roote also is like the last.


9. _Crocus Episcopalis._   The Bishops Crocus.

This party coloured or Bishops Saffron flower, is very like both in
leaues and rootes vnto the Neapolitane blew Crocus, but somewhat
greater: the flowers doe abide not so long time blowne, and hath all
the leaues either wholly white, with blew stripes on both sides of
them, or wholly of a fine delayed blew Violet colour, and the three
innermost more blew and finely striped, both on the inside and outside
of them, and sometimes it hath been seen to haue three leaues white,
and three leaues of a pale blew.


10. _Crocus vernus striatus vulgaris._   The ordinary stript Crocus.

There is another sort of stript Saffron flower, which is most common
and plentifull in most Gardens, which I must needes bring vnder the
ranke of these white kinds, although it differre very notably, both
in roote, leafe, and flower, from all of them: the leaues of this
rise vp sooner then the yellow or white Crocus, lying spread vpon the
ground for the most part, but narrower then any of the former: among
these leaues spring vp diuers flowers, almost as large as the former
great white Crocus, of a very bleake or pale purple colour, tending to
white on the inside, and in many almost white, with some small whitish
chiues tipt with yellow in the middle: the three outer leaues are of
a yellowish white colour on the backe side of them, stript euery one
of them with three broad stripes, of a darke murrey or purple colour,
and a little sprinkled with some small purple lines, on both sides of
those stripes; but on the inside, of the same pale purple or white
colour with the rest: the seede hereof is somewhat darker coloured then
of the white, and is more liberall in bearing: the roote is differing
from all the former, being rounder and bigger then any of them, except
the kindes of Misia, yet somewhat flat withall, not hauing any shootes
from the sides, but setting off into rootes plentifully, hauing a round
circle compassing the bottome of the roote, which easily falleth away,
when it is taken vp out of the ground, and couered with a browne coate,
somewhat neare the colour of the yellow Crocus, but not altogether so
bright: it flowreth vsually the first of all these sorts, or with the
first of the early yellowes.

11. _Crocus vernus striatus Turcitus._   The Turkie stript Crocus.

There is another of this kinde, whose flower is a little larger, and
of a deeper purple colour, both on the inside and outside; the greene
leafe also is bigger, and of a more whitish colour.


12. _Crocus vernus Capillarifolio albus._
The white Crocus with small leaues.

This white Crocus is in all things like vnto the purple of the
same kinde, but that the flower of this is wholly white: the full
description therefore hereof, you shall haue in that purple with small
leaues, of this kinde hereafter set downe, whereunto I referre you.


13. _Crocus vernus purpureus minor._   The smaller purple Crocus.

The smaller purple Saffron flower of the Spring, hath his greene leaues
so like vnto the first white flowred Saffron, that they can hardly be
distinguished, onely they seem to bee a little narrower: the flower
is also much about the same bignesse, or a little bigger, and seldome
beareth aboue one flower from a roote, euen as the first doth, of a
deepe purple Violet colour, the bottome of the flower, with the vpper
part of the stalke next thereunto, being of a deeper or blacker purple;
in the middle of the flower are some pale chiues tipt with yellow
pendents, and a longer pointell, diuided or forked at the toppe: the
roote of this is in all things so like vnto the first white, that it
is impossible for the most cunning and conuersant in them, to know the
one from the other. This beareth seede very sparingly, as the white
doth, and is reddish like vnto it, but recompenseth that defect with
a plentifull encrease by the roote: it likewise flowereth at the very
same time with the white, and endureth as small a time.


14. _Crocus vernus purpureus maximus._   The greatest purple Crocus.

This great purple Crocus is of the same kinde with the next described,
as well in roote as leafe, but greater; for the greene leaues hereof
are the greatest and broadest of all other Crocus, with a large white
line in the middle of euery one: it springeth vp much later then the
former, and doth not shew his flower vntill the other bee past a good
while: the flowers also are the largest of all these Crocus of the
Spring time, and equalling, if not surpassing that purple kinde that
flowreth in Autumne, hereafter set forth, of a very faire and deepe
Violet colour, almost as deepe as the former: the seed vessels are
large also and white, wherein is contained pale reddish seede, like
vnto the next blew kinde, but somewhat greater: the roote is (as I
said before) like vnto the next, that is, flat and round, with a
duskie coloured outside, whose head for springing in it is as hardly
discerned.

[Sidenote: _Alter Apicibus albidis._]

We haue one of this kinde, the toppes onely of whose purple flower
are whitish, for the breadth of halfe the naile of a mans hand, which
abideth constant euery yeare in that manner, and therefore is a
difference fit to be remembred.


15. _Crocus vernus Neapolitanus siue cæruleus maior._
The greater blew Crocus of Naples.

This great blew Crocus riseth vp with diuers greene leaues, broader
then any of the former (except the last) with a white line running
downe the inside of euery leafe, as in the former, among which riseth
vp, out of diuers great long white skinnes, diuers large flowers, but
not fully so great as the former, consisting of six leaues, of a paler
blew or Violet colour then in the former, hauing in the middle of the
flowers a few pale threeds, tipt with yellow, and a longer pointell
of a gold yellow colour, forked or diuided at the toppe, smelling
sweeter then in the former, and abiding a great while longer, being in
flower vsually euen with the stript yellow Crocus, or before the former
purple, and yeelding more plenty of seede: the roote hereof is not very
great, but a little darke on the outside, being round and flat withall,
that one can hardly know which is the vpperside thereof.

[Sidenote: _Crocus Neapolitanus præcocior._]

This kinde differeth very little from the former, either in roote,
leafe, or flower, for the bignesse or colour, but that it seemeth to be
a little bleaker or paler blew, because it flowreth a little earlier.


16. _Crocus vernus purpureus striatus._   The stript purple Crocus.

The leaues of this stript purple Saffron flower, are as large and
broad as the last, or rather a little longer: the flowers also are
as plentifull, and as large, of a fine delayed purple colour on the
outside, with three broad strakes or lines downe the backe of the three
outer leaues, and of a little deeper purple on the inside, as the other
three leaues are also of a deeper purple colour, and are striped with
the same deepe purple about the ground, or bottome of the leaues: this
sometimes yeeldeth three square heads, containing in them brownish
seede: the roote is like vnto the last, and flowreth much about the
time of the former.


17. _Crocus vernus purpureus versicolor._
The siluer stript purple Crocus.

This stript Saffron flower, is in leaues and flowers somewhat like
vnto the last stript purple, but a little smaller: the flowers are
of a little deeper purple through the whole leaues, striped with
white lines, both on the leaues, and towards the edges, which maketh
a peculiar difference from all the rest: the roote of this is not so
flat, though like it, and couered with a darke ash coloured skinne: it
flowreth about the same time.


18. _Crocus purpureus flammeus maior._
The greater purple flame coloured Crocus.

The greene leaues of this Crocus or Saffron flower, are of a reasonable
breadth and length, and of a pleasant fresh greenesse, with a faire
broad white line downe the middle of them, but rising not out of the
ground so early as the next described Crocus: the flowers are likewise
of a meane bignesse, of a pale purple on the outside, somewhat whitish,
especially the three outer leaues; but on the inside of a deeper
purple, and striped with great stripes like flames, hauing some chiues
in the middle, and a longer one also feathered a little at the toppe:
the roote is white on the outside, somewhat flat and round, but not so
flat as the Neapolitane Crocus before described.


19. _Crocus purpureus flammeus minor._
The lesser purple flame coloured Crocus.

This Crocus hath almost as broad and long greene leaues as the former,
and of the same verdure, which rise vp earlier then it, and is in
flower likewise somewhat before it, being smaller for size by a little,
but of as deepe a purple on the outside, as on the inside, flamed with
faire broad stripes from the middle of the leaues, or somewhat lower
vnto the edges: each of these giue seed that is of a pale reddish
colour: the root is very like vnto the former, but a little lesser.


20. _Crocus vernus purpureus Capillarifolio._
The purple Crocus with small leaues.

This small kinde of Saffron flower riseth out of the ground, with two
or three long and small green leaues, very like vnto the leaues of
the fine Fether-Grasse hereafter described, standing vpright at the
first, but afterwards lying vpon the ground; among which come the
flowers, sometimes three, but most vsually two vpon one stalke, if the
roote be not young, which then will beare but one on a stalke, which
is very short, so that the flowers scarce arise aboue the ground, yet
laying themselues open in the day time, if it be faire, and the Sunne
doe shine, otherwise they keepe close, and doe not open at all: and
after one flower is past, which doth not last aboue three or foure
dayes at the most, the others follow, which are of a bleake blewish
purple in the middle of the flower, and of a deeper purple towards the
ends or points or the leaues, but of a more sullen or darke purple on
the outside of them, and yellowish at the bottome, with some yellow
chiues in the middle: the seede is small and darker coloured then any
of the former Crocus, contained also in smaller heads, standing one
by another vpon the same short foote-stalke, which then riseth vp a
little higher, shewing the maner of the standing of the flowers, which
in their flowring time could not so easily bee discerned: the roote is
very small and round, hauing one side at the bottome lower then the
other, very like the roote of a _Colchicum_ or Medowe Saffron, and
somewhat neare resembling also the hoofe of an horse foote, couered
with a very thicke skinne, of a darke or blackish browne colour: this
flowreth the last of all the former sorts of Saffron flowers, euen when
they are all past.


21. _Crocus vernus purpureus striatus Capillarifolio._
The stript purple Crocus with small leaues.

This small stript purple Saffron flower hath such like leaues, as the
last described hath, betweene which riseth the flower vpon as short
a foote-stalke, consisting of six leaues like the former, of a faire
purple colour on the outside of the three outer leaues, with three
lines or strakes downe euery leafe, of a deeper purple colour, and
on the inside of a paler purple, as the other three leaues are also,
with some chiues tipt with yellow pendents, and a forked pointell in
the middle: the roote of this is somewhat bigger then the former, and
rounder, but couered with as thicke and as browne a skinne: it flowreth
about the same time with the former.


22. _Crocus vernus luteus siue Mæsiacus._   The yellow Crocus.

The yellow Crocus or Saffron flower, riseth vp with three or foure
leaues out of the ground, being somewhat neare the breadth of the great
purple kindes, with a white line in them, as in most of the rest: the
flowers stand in the middle of these leaues, and are very large, of a
gold yellow colour, with some chiues, and a forked point in the middle:
the seede hereof is of a brighter colour then in any of the other:
the roote is great and round, as great or greater then a Wall Nut
sometimes, and couered with reddish skinnes or coates, yeelding more
store of flowers then most of the former, and beginning to blowe with
the first sorts, or presently after, but outlast many of them, and are
of a pleasant good sent.

[Sidenote: _Flore aureo._]

Of this kinde we haue some, whose flowers are of a deeper gold yellow
colour then others, so that they appeare reddish withall.

[Sidenote: _Flore pallido._]

And we haue also another sort, whose flowers are very pale, betweene a
white and a yellow, not differing in any thing else.

[Sidenote: _Flore viridante luteo._]

And another smaller, whose flower hath a shew of greennesse in the
yellow, and more greene at the bottome.


23. _Crocus vernus flavus striatus._   The yellow stript Crocus.

This kinde of yellow stript Crocus or Saffron flower, riseth vp with
more store of narrower and greener leaues then the former, and after
the leaues are spread, there rise vp many yellow flowers from among
them, which are not of so faire and bright a yellow colour, but more
dead and sullen, hauing on the backside of each of the three outtermost
leaues, three small stripes, of an ouer-worne or dull purple colour,
with some chiues and a pointell in the middle: the roote of this kinde,
is very like the roote of the former yellow, but somewhat smaller
and shorter, and couered with the like reddish skinnes, but a little
sadder: it flowreth not so early as the former yellow, but abideth
almost as long as it.


24. _Crocus vernus luteus versicolor primus._
The best cloth of gold Crocus.

The fairest cloth of gold Crocus or Saffron flower, riseth vp very
early, euen with the first, or the first of all other Crocus, with
three or foure very narrow and short leaues, of a whiter colour then
any of the former, which by and by after doe shew forth the flowers,
rising from among them out of the same white skinne, which includeth
the leaues, but are not so plentifull as the former yellow, being but
two or three at the most, of a faire gold yellow colour, yet somewhat
paler then the first, hauing on the backe of euery of the three outer
leaues, three faire and great stripes, of a faire deepe purple colour,
with some small lines at the sides or edges of those purple stripes; on
the inside of these flowers, there is no signe or shew of any line or
spot, but wholly of a faire gold yellow, with chiues and a fethertopt
pointell in the middle: the seede hereof is like the former, but not
so red: the roote of this kinde is easily knowne from the roote of any
other Saffron flower, because the outer peelings or shels being hard,
are as it were netted on the outside, hauing certaine ribbes, rising
vp higher then the rest of the skinnes, diuided in the forme of a
net-worke, of a darke browne colour, and is smaller and rounder then
the former yellow, and not encreasing so plentifully by the roote.


25. _Crocus vernus luteus versicolor alter._
The second cloth of gold, or Duke Crocus.

There is no difference either in roote, leafe, or colour of flower, or
time of flowring in this sort from the last before mentioned; for the
flower of this is of the same bignesse and colour, the only note of
difference is in the marking of the three outer leaues, which haue not
three stripes like the former, but are wholly of the same deepe purple
colour on the backe of them, sauing that the edges of them are yellow,
which is the forme of a Duke Tulipa, and from thence it tooke the name
of a Duke Crocus.


26. _Crocus vernus versicolor pallideluteus._
The pale cloth of gold Crocus.

We haue a third sort of this kinde of cloth of gold Crocus, which hath
leaues and flowers like the former, but differeth in this, that the
colour of the flower is of a paler yellow by much, but stript in the
same manner as the first, but with a fainter purple colour: the roote
also is netted like them, to shew that this is but a variation of the
same kinde.


27. _Crocus vernus versicolor albidoluteus._
The cloth of siluer Crocus.

The chiefest note of difference in this Saffron flower is, that being
as large a flower as any of the former of this kinde, it is of so pale
a yellowish white, that it is more white then yellow, which some doe
call a butter colour: the three outer leaues are striped on the backe
of them, with a paler purple blew shining colour, the bottome of the
flower, and the vpper part of the stalke, being of the same purple blew
colour: the roote of this is also netted as the other, to shew it is a
variety of the same kinde.

And thus much for those Saffron flowers that come in the Spring time;
now to those that flower in Autumne onely: and first of the true
Saffron.


1. _Crocus verus sativus Autumnalis._   The true Saffron.

The true Saffron that is vsed in meates and medicines, shooteth out
his narrow long greene leaues first, and after a while the flowers in
the middle of them appeare about the end of August, in September and
October, according to the soile, and climate where they growe; these
flowers are as large as any of the other former or late sorts, composed
of six leaues a peece, of a murrey or reddish purple colour, hauing a
shew of blew in them: in the middle of these flowers there are some
small yellow chiues standing vpright, which are as vnprofitable, as
the chiues in any other of the wilde Saffrons, before or hereafter
specified; but besides these, each flower hath two, three, or foure
greater and longer chiues, hanging downe vpon or betweene the leaues,
which are of a fierie red colour, and are the true blades of Saffron,
which are vsed physically or otherwise, and no other: All these blades
being pickt from the seuerall flowers, are laid and pressed together
into cakes, and afterwards dryed very warily on a Kill to preserue
them; as they are to be seene in the shops where they are sold. I neuer
heard that euer it gaue seede with any: the roote groweth often to be
as great, or greater then a green Wall Nut, with the outer shell on it,
couered with a grayish or ash-coloured skin, which breaketh into long
haire threeds, otherwise then in any other roote of Crocus.


2. _Crocus Byzantium argenteus._   The siluer coloured Autumne Crocus.

This Saffron flower springeth vp in October, and seldome before, with
three or foure short greene leaues at the first, but growing longer
afterwards, and in the midst of them, presently after they haue
appeared, one flower for the most part, and seldome two, consisting of
six leaues, the three outermost whereof are somewhat larger then the
other three within, and are of a pale bleake blew colour, almost white,
which many call a siluer colour, the three innermost being of a purer
white, with some yellow chiues in the middle, and a longer pointell
ragged or fethered at the toppe: this very seldome beareth seede, but
when the yeare falleth out to bee very milde; it is small, round, and
of a darke colour: the roote is pretty bigge, and rounder then any
other Crocus, without any flat bottome, and couered with a darke russet
skinne.


3. _Crocus Pyrenæus purpureus._   The purple mountaine Crocus.

This purple Saffron flower of the Autumne, riseth vp but with one
flower vsually, yet sometimes with two one after another, without any
leaues at all, in September, or sometimes in August, standing vpon a
longer foote-stalke then any kinde of Saffron flower, either of the
Spring or Autumne, and is as large as the flower of the greatest purple
Saffron flower of the Spring, of a very deepe Violet purple colour,
which decayeth after it hath stood blowne three or foure dayes, and
becommeth more pale, hauing in the middle some yellow chiues, and a
long fether topt pointell, branched, and rising sometimes aboue the
edges of the flowers: about a moneth after the flowers are past, and
sometimes not vntill the first of the Spring, there riseth vp three or
foure long and broad greene leaues, with a white line in euery one of
them, like vnto the first purple Vernall kindes, which abide vntill
the end of May or Iune: the roote is small and white on the outside,
so like vnto the roote of the lesser Vernall purple or white Crocus,
that it cannot be distinguished, vntill about the end of August, when
it doth begin to shoot, and then by the early shooting vp a long white
sprout for flower, it may be knowne. I neuer could obserue it to giue
any seede, the Winter (as I thinke) comming on it so quickly after the
flowring, being the cause to hinder it.


4. _Crocus montanus Autumnalis._   The Autumne mountaine Crocus.

The mountaine Saffron flower springeth vp later then any of the former,
and doth not appeare vntill the middle or end of October, when all the
flowers of the former are past, appearing first with three or foure
short greene leaues, like vnto the Byzantine Crocus, and afterwards
the flowers betweene them, which are of a pale or bleake blew tending
to a purple, the foote-stalkes of them being so short, that they
scarce appeare aboue ground at the first, but after two or three dayes
they grow a little higher: the roote is very great and flat bottomed,
couered with a grayish duskie coate or skinne, and encreaseth very
little or seldome.


        The Place.

        The seuerall places of these Saffron flowers, are in part set
        downe in their titles; the others haue beene found out, some
        in one Countrey, and some in another, as the small purple and
        white, and stript white in Spaine: the yellow in Mesia about
        Belgrade, the great purple in Italy; and now by such friends
        helpes as haue sent them, they prosper as well in our Gardens,
        as in their naturall places. Yet I must giue you this to
        vnderstand, that some of these formerly expressed, haue been
        raised vp vnto vs by the sowing of their seede.


        The Time.

        Their seuerall times are likewise expressed in their
        descriptions; for some shew forth their pleasant flowers in
        the Spring, wherein for the three first moneths, our Gardens
        are furnished with the varietie of one sort or another: the
        rest in Autumne, that so they might procure the more delight,
        in yeelding their beauty both early and late, when scarce any
        other flowers are found to adorne them.


        The Names.

        I shall not neede to trouble you with an idle tale of the name
        of Crocus, which were to little purpose, nor to reiterate
        the former names imposed vpon them; let it suffice that the
        fittest names are giuen them, that may distinguish them one
        from another; onely this I must giue you to vnderstand, that
        the gold yellow _Crocus_ or Saffron flower, is the true _Crocus
        Mæsiacus_, as I shewed before; and that neither the yellow
        stript, or cloth of gold (which wee so call after the Dutch
        name _Gaud Laken_) is the true _Mæsiacus_, as some suppose; and
        that the great white Saffron flower, by reason of his likenesse
        vnto the gold yellow, is called _Crocus albus Mæsiaci facie_,
        or _facie lutei_, that is, The white Saffron flower that is
        like the _Mæsiacus_ or yellow.


        The Vertues.

        The true Saffron (for the others are of no vse) which wee call
        English Saffron, is of very great vse both for inward and
        outward diseases, and is very cordiall, vsed to expell any
        hurtfull or venomous vapours from the heart, both in the small
        Pockes, Measels, Plague, Iaundise, and many other diseases, as
        also to strengthen and comfort any cold or weake members.

CHAP. XVIII.

_Sisyrinchium._   The Spanish Nut.


I can doe no otherwise then make a peculiar Chapter of this plant,
because it is neither a _Crocus_, although in the roote it come
somewhat neare vnto that kinde that is netted; but in no other part
agreeing with any the delineaments of a Saffron flower, and therefore
could not be thrust into the Chapter amongst them: neither can I place
it in the forefront of the Chapter of the _Iris bulbosa_, or bulbous
Flowerdeluces, because it doth not belong to that Family: and although
the flower thereof doth most resemble a Flowerdeluce, yet in that no
other parts thereof doe fitly agree thereunto, I haue rather chosen to
seate it by it selfe betweene them both, as partaking of both natures,
and so may serue in stead of a bridge, to passe from the one to the
other, that is, from the _Crocus_ or Saffron flower, to the _Iris
bulbosa_ or bulbous rooted Flowerdeluce, which shall follow in the next
Chapter by themselues.

The Spanish Nut hath two long and narrow, soft and smooth greene
leaues, lying for the most part vpon the ground, and sometimes standing
vp, yet bending downewards; betweene these leaues riseth vp a small
stalke, halfe a foote high, hauing diuers smooth soft greene leaues
vpon it, as if they were skinnes, through which the stalke passeth; at
the toppe whereof stand diuers flowers, rising one after another, and
not all flowring at once: for seldome shall you haue aboue one flower
blowne at a time, each whereof doth so quickly passe and fade away,
that one may well say, that it is but one dayes flower, or rather the
flower of a few houres: the flower it selfe hath nine leaues, like
vnto a Flowerdeluce, whereof the three that fall downe, haue in each
of them a yellow spot: the other three, which in the Flowerdeluces are
hollow and ridged, couering the other three that fall downe, in this
stand vpright, and are parted at the ends: the three that stand vp
in the middle are small and short: the whole flower is smaller then
any Flowerdeluce, but of sundry colours; for some are of an excellent
skie colour blew, others of a Violet purple, others of a darker purple
colour, and some white, and many others mixed, either pale blew and
deepe purple, or white and blew mixed or striped together very
variably, quickly fading as I said before: the seede is enclosed in
small cods, so thinne and transparent that one may easily see, and tell
the seeds as they lye, which are of a brownish red colour: the roote is
small, blackish and round, wrapped in a thicke skinne or huske, made
like vnto a net, or somewhat like vnto the roote of the cloth of gold
Crocus: when the plant is in flower, it is found to haue two rootes
one aboue another, whereof the vppermost is firme and sound, and the
vndermost loose and spongie, in like manner as is found in the rootes
of diuers Orchides or Satyrions, Bee-flowers and the like, and without
any good taste, or sweetnesse at all, although Clusius saith otherwise.


_Sisyrinchium Mauritanicum._   The Barbary Nut.

There is another of this kinde, not differing from the former in any
other notable part, but in the flower, which in this is of a delayed
purplish red colour, hauing in each of the three lower leaues a white
spot, in stead of the yellow in the former, but are as soone fading as
they.


        The Place.

        The former doe grow very plentifully in many parts both of
        Spaine and Portugall, where Guillaume Boel, a Dutch man
        heretofore remembred often in this Booke, found them; of the
        sundry colours specified, whereas Clusius maketh mention but of
        one colour that he found.

        The other was found in that part of Barbary, where Fez and
        Morocco do stand, and brought first into the Lowe-Countries:
        but they are both very tender, and will hardly abide the hard
        Winters of these colder regions.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth in May and Iune, the last not vntill August.


        The Names.

        The name _Sisyrinchium_ is generally imposed vpon this plant,
        by all authors that haue written thereof, thinking it to bee
        the right _Sisyrinchium_ of Theophrastus: but concerning the
        Spanish name _Nozelha_, which Clusius saith it is called by in
        Spaine, I haue beene credibly enformed by the aforenamed Boel,
        that this roote is not so called in those parts; but that the
        small or common stript Crocus is called _Nozelha_, which is
        sweete in taste, and desired very greedily by the Shepheards
        and Children, and that the roote of this _Sisyrinchium_ or
        Spanish Nut, is without any taste, and is not eaten. And
        againe, that there is not two kindes, although it grow greater,
        and with more flowers, in those places that are neare the Sea,
        where both the washing of the Sea water, and the moisture and
        ayre of the Sea, causeth the ground to bee more fertile. This I
        thought good, from the true relation of a friend, to giue the
        world to vnderstand, that truth might expell errour.


        The Vertues.

        These haue not beene knowne to bee vsed to any Physicall
        purpose, but wholly neglected, vnlesse some may eate them, as
        Clusius reporteth.




CHAP. XIX.

_Iris bulbosa._   The bulbous Flowerdeluce.


The Flowerdeluces that haue bulbous rootes are of two sorts, the
one greater then the other: the greater bearing larger and broader
leaues and flowers, and the lesser narrower. But before I giue you
the descriptions of the vsuall greater kindes, I must needes place
one or two in the fore-front that haue no fellowes; the one is called
of Clusius, his broad leafed Flowerdeluce, and the other a Persian,
somewhat like vnto it, which although they differ notably from the
rest, yet they haue the nearest resemblance vnto those greater kindes,
that come next after them.


_Iris bulbosa prima latifolia Clusij._
Clusius his first great bulbous Flowerdeluce.

This Flowerdeluce hath diuers long and broad leaues, not stiffe, like
all the other, but soft and greenish on the vpperside, and whitish
vnderneath; among which rise vp sometimes seuerall small, short,
slender stalkes, and sometimes but one, not aboue halfe a foote
high, bearing at the top one flower a peece, somewhat like vnto a
Flowerdeluce, consisting of nine leaues, whereof those three that stand
vpright, are shorter and more closed together, then in other sorts of
Flowerdeluces; the other three that fall downe, turne vp their ends a
little, and those three, that in other Flowerdeluces doe couer them at
the bottome, stand like the vpright leaues of other Flowerdeluces, but
are parted into two ends, like vnto two small eares: the whole flower
is of a faire blew, or pale skie colour in most, with a long stripe in
the middle of each of the three falling leaues, and in some white, but
more seldome: the roote is reasonable great, round and white, vnder
the blackish coates wherewith it is couered, hauing many long thicke
white rootes in stead of fibres, which make them seeme to be Asphodill
rootes. The flower is very sweete.


_Iris bulbosa Persica._   The Persian bulbous Flowerdeluce.

This Persian Flowerdeluce is somewhat like vnto the former, both in
roote and in leafe, but that the leaues are shorter and narrower,
and the flower being much about the same fashion, is of a pale blew
russetish colour, each of the three lower falling leaues are almost
wholly of a browne purple colour, with a yellow spot in the middle of
them: this as it is very rare, so it seldome beareth flowers with vs.


        The Place.

        The first groweth in many places of Spaine and Portugall, from
        whence I and others haue often had it for our Gardens, but
        by reason of the tendernesse thereof, it doth hardly endure
        the sharpnesse of our cold Winters, vnlesse it be carefully
        preserued.

        The other is said to come from Persia, and therefore it is so
        entituled, and is as tender to be kept as the other.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth most vsually not vntill May with vs, yet
        many times sooner: but in Ianuary and February, as Clusius
        saith, in the naturall places thereof.

        The other is as early oftentimes when it doth flower with vs.


        The Names.

        Because Clusius by good iudgement referreth the first to the
        greater kindes of Flowerdeluces, and placeth it in the fore
        ranke, calling it _Iris bulbosa latifolia prima_, that is, The
        first broad leafed Flowerdeluce, and all others doe the like,
        I haue (as you see) in the like manner put it before all the
        other, and keepe the same name. The Spaniards, as he saith,
        called it _Lirio espadanal_, and they of Corduba, _Lirios
        azules_.

        The other hath no other name then as it is in the title.


1. _Iris bulbosa maior siue Anglica cærulea._
The blew English bulbous Flowerdeluce.

This bulbous Flowerdeluce riseth vp early, euen in Ianuary oftentimes,
with fiue or six long and (narrow, in comparison of any great breadth,
but in regard of the other kinde) broad whitish green leaues, crested
or straked on the backside, and halfe round, being hollow like a trough
or gutter, white all along the inside of the leafe, and blunt at the
end; among which riseth vp a stiffe round stalke, a cubit or two foot
high, at the toppe whereof, out of a skinnie huske, commeth forth one
or two flowers, consisting of nine leaues a peece, three whereof that
are turned downewards, are larger and broader then the other, hauing
in each of them a yellow spot, about the middle of the leafe, other
three are small, hollow, ridged or arched, couering the lower part
next the stalke of those falling leaues, turning vp their ends, which
are diuided into two parts, other three stand vpright, and are very
small at the bottome of them, and broader toward the toppe: the whole
flower is of a faire blew colour; after the flowers are past, come vp
three square heads, somewhat long, and lanke, or loose, containing in
them round yellowish seede, which when it is ripe, will rattle by the
shaking of the winde in the dry huskes: the roote of this kinde is
greater and longer then any of the smaller kindes with narrow leaues,
couered with diuers browne skinnes, which seeme to be fraught with long
threeds like haires, especially at the small or vpper end of the roote,
which thing you shall not finde in any of the smaller kindes.


2. _Iris bulbosa maior purpurea & purpuro violacea._
The paler or deeper purple great bulbous Flowerdeluce.

These purple Flowerdeluces differ not from the last described, either
in roote or leafe: the chiefest difference consisteth in the flowers,
which in these are somewhat larger then in the former, and in the one
of a deepe blew or Violet purple colour, and in the other of a deepe
purple colour, in all other things alike.

[Sidenote: _Flore cinereo._]

There is also another, in all other things like vnto the former, but
only in the flower, which is of a pale or bleake blew, which we call an
ash-colour.


3. _Iris bulbosa maior purpurea variegata siue striata._
The great purple stript bulbous Flowerdeluce.

There is another of the purple kinde, whose flower is purple, but with
some veines or stripes of a deeper Violet colour, diuersly running
through the whole leaues of the flower.

[Sidenote: _Flore cinereo striata purpureo._]

And another of that bleake blew or ash-colour, with lines and veines of
purple in the leaues of the flowers, some more or lesse then other.

[Sidenote: _Flore purpureo orbe cinereo._]

And againe another, whose flower is of a purple colour like vnto
the second, but that round about that yellow spot, in the middle of
each of the three falling leaues (as is vsuall in all the bulbous
Flowerdeluces) there is a circle of a pale blew or ash-colour, the rest
of the leafe remaining purple, as the other parts of the flower is.


4. _Iris bulbosa maior flore rubente._
The great peach coloured bulbous Flowerdeluce.

There is another of these greater kindes, more rare then any of the
former, not differing in roote, leafe, or flower, from the former,
but onely that the flower in this is of a pale reddish purple colour,
comming somewhat neare vnto the colour of a peach blossome.


5. _Iris bulbosa maior siue latifolia alba._
The great white bulbous Flowerdeluce.

The great white bulbous Flowerdeluce, riseth not vp so early out of the
ground as the blew or purple doth, but about a moneth or more after,
whose leaues are somewhat larger, and broader then of the others: the
stalke is thicker and shorter, bearing vsually two very large and great
flowers, one flowring a little before the other, yet oftentimes both
in flower together in the end, of a bleake blewish white colour, which
wee call a siluer colour, while they are in the budde, and before they
be blowne open, but then of a purer white, yet with an eye or shew of
that siluer colour remaining in them, the three falling leaues being
very large, and hauing that yellow spot in the middle of each of them:
the seedes are likewise inclosed in heads, like vnto the blew or purple
kindes, but larger, and are of a reddish yellow colour like them: the
roote likewise is not differing, but greater.


6. _Iris bulbosa maior alba variegata._
The great white stript bulbous Flowerdeluce.

This white stript Flowerdeluce, is in roote, leafe, and flower, and in
manner of growing, like vnto the former white Flowerdeluce; the onely
difference is in the marking of the flower, being diuers from it: for
this hath in the white flower great veines, stripes, or markes, of a
Violet blew colour, dispersed through the leaues of the flower very
variably, which addeth a superexcellent beauty to the flower.


7. _Iris bulbosa maior siue latifolia versicolor._
The great party coloured bulbous Flowerdeluce.

There is no difference in this from the former, but in the flower,
which is of a whitish colour in the three falling leaues, hauing a
circle of ash-colour about the yellow spot, the three rigged leaues
being likewise whitish, but ridged and edged with that ash-colour, and
the three vpright leaues of a pale blewish white colour, with some
veines therein of a blewish purple.

[Sidenote: _Varietas._]

There hath beene brought vnto vs diuers rootes of these kindes, with
the dryed flowers remaining on them, wherein there hath beene seene
more varieties, then I can well remember to expresse, which variety it
is very probable, hath risen by the sowing of the seeds, as is truely
obserued in the narrower leafed kinde of Flowerdeluce, in the Tulipa,
and in some other plants.

[Sidenote: _Flore luteo._]

Wee haue heard of one of this kinde of broad leafed Flowerdeluces, that
should beare a yellow flower, in the like manner as is to be seene in
the narrow leafed ones: but I haue not seene any such, and therefore I
dare report no further of it, vntill time hath discouered the truth or
falshood of the report.

]


        The Place.

        Lobelius is the first reporter, that the blew Flowerdeluce
        or first kinde of these broad leafed Flowerdeluces, groweth
        naturally in the West parts of England; but I am in some doubt
        of the truth of that report: for I rather thinke, that some in
        their trauels through Spaine, or other parts where it groweth,
        being delighted with the beauty of the flower, did gather the
        rootes, and bring them ouer with them, and dwelling in some of
        the West parts of England, planted them, and there encreasing
        so plentifully as they doe, they were imparted to many,
        thereby in time growing common in all Countrey folkes Gardens
        thereabouts. They grow also, and all the other, and many more
        varieties, about Tholouse, from whence Plantinianus Gassanus
        both sent and brought vs them, with many other bulbous rootes,
        and rare plants gathered thereabouts.


        The Time.

        These doe flower vsually in the end of May, or beginning of
        Iune, and their seede is ripe in the end of Iuly or August.


        The Names.

        Lobel calleth the first English blew Flowerdeluce, _Hyacinthus
        Poetarum flore Iridis, & propter Hyacinthinum colorem, id est
        violaceum dictus_: but I know not any great good ground for
        it, more then the very colour; for it is neither of the forme
        of a Lilly, neither hath it those mourning markes imprinted in
        it, which the Poet faineth to bee in his Hyacinth. It is most
        truely called an _Iris_, or Flowerdeluce (and there is great
        difference betweene a Lilly and a Flowerdeluce, for the formes
        of their flowers) because it answereth thereunto very exactly,
        for the flower, and is therefore called vsually by most,
        either _Iris bulbosa Anglica_, or _Iris bulbosa maior siue
        latifolia_, for a difference betweene it, and the lesser with
        narrow leaues: In English, eyther The great English bulbous
        Flowerdeluce, or the great broad leafed bulbous Flowerdeluce,
        which you will, adding the other name, according to the colour.

And thus much for these broad leafed bulbous Flowerdeluces, so much
as hath come to our knowledge. Now to the seuerall varieties of the
narrow leafed bulbous Flowerdeluces, so much likewise as we haue been
acquainted with.


_Iris bulbosa minor siue angustifolia alba._
The smaller white or narrow leafed bulbous Flowerdeluce.

This first Flowerdeluce, which beareth the smaller flower of the two
white ones, that are here to bee described, springeth out of the ground
alwaies before Winter, which after breaketh forth into foure or fiue
small and narrow leaues, a foote long or more, of a whitish greene on
the inside, which is hollow and chanalled, and of a blewish greene
colour on the outside, and round withall: the stalke of this kinde is
longer and slenderer then the former, with some shorter leaues vpon
it, at the toppe whereof, out of short skinny leaues, stand one or
two flowers, smaller, shorter, and rounder then the flowers of the
former broad leafed Flowerdeluces, but made after the same proportion
with nine leaues, three falling downewards, with a yellow spot in the
middle, other three are made like a long arch, which couer the lower
part next the stalke of those falling leaues, and turne vp at the ends
of them, where they are diuided into two parts: the other three stand
vpright, betweene each of the three falling leaues, being somewhat long
and narrow: the flower is wholly, (sauing the yellow spot) of a pure
white colour, yet in some hauing a shew of some blew throughout, and
in others towards the bottome of the three vpright leaues: after the
flowers are past, there rise vp so many long cods or seede vessels, as
there were flowers, which are longer and smaller then in the former,
and a little bending like a Corner, with three round squares, and round
pointed also, which diuiding it selfe when the seede is ripe into three
parts, doe shew six seuerall cells or places, wherein is contained such
like round reddish yellow seedes, but smaller then the former: the
roote is smaller and shorter then the former, and without any haires
or threeds, couered with browne thin skinnes, and more plentifull in
giuing encrease.


_Iris bulbosa angustifolia alba flore maiore._
The greater white narrow leafed bulbous Flowerdeluce.

I shall not neede to make a seuerall description to euery one of
these Flowerdeluces that follow, for that were but to make often
repetition of one thing, which being once done, as it is, may well
serue to expresse all the rest, and but onely to adde the especiall
differences, either in leafe or flower, for bignesse, colour, or forme,
as is expedient to expresse and distinguish them seuerally. This
greater white bulbous Flowerdeluce is like vnto the last described in
all parts, sauing that it is a little larger and higher, both in leafe,
stalke, and flower, and much whiter then any of these mixed sorts that
follow, yet not so white as the former: the roote hereof is likewise a
little bigger and rounder in the middle.


_Albescens._    Milke white.

        There is another, whose falling leaues haue a little shew of
        yellownesse in them, and so are the middle ridges of the arched
        leaues, but the vpright leaues are more white, not differing in
        roote or leafe from the first white.

_Argentea._    Siluer colour.

        And another, whose falls are of a yellowish white, like the
        last, the arched leaues are whiter, and the vpright leaues of a
        blewish white, which we call a siluer colour.

_Albida._    Whitish.

        Another hath the fals yellowish, and sometimes with a little
        edge of white about them, and sometimes without; the vpright
        leaues are whitish, as the arched leaues are, yet the ridge
        yellower.

_Albida labris luteis._    White with yellow fals.

          Another hath his fals yellow, and the vpright leaues white,
          all these flowers are about the same bignesse with the first.

_Albida angustior._    The narrow white.

          But we haue another, whose flower is smaller, and almost as
          white as the second, the lower leaues are small, and doe as
          it were stand outright, not hauing almost any fal at all,
          so that the yellow spot seemeth to be the whole leafe, the
          arched leaues are not halfe so large as in the former, and
          the vpright leaues bowe themselues in the middle, so that the
          tops doe as it were meete together.

          And another of the same, whose falling leaues are a little
          more eminent and yellow, with a yellower spot.

_Aurea siue lutea Hispanica._    The Spanish yellow.

        We haue another kinde that is called the Spanish yellow, which
        riseth not vp so high, as ordinarily most of the rest doe, and
        is wholly of a gold yellow colour.

_Pallide lutea._    Straw colour.

        There is another, that vsually riseth higher then the former
        yellow, and is wholly of a pale yellow, but deeper at the spot.

_Albida lutea._    Pale Straw colour.

        There is also another like vnto the pale yellow, but that the
        falling leaues are whiter then all the rest of the flower.

_Mauritanica flaua serotina minor._    The small Barbary yellow.

        There is a smaller or dwarfe kinde, brought from the backe
        parts of Barbary, neare the Sea, like vnto the yellow, but
        smaller and lower, and in stead of vpright leaues, hath small
        short leaues like haires: it flowreth very late, after all
        others haue almost giuen their seede.

_Versicolor Hispanica cærulea labris albis._
 The party coloured Spanish.

        We haue another sort is called the party coloured Spanish
        bulbous Flowerdeluce, whose falling leaues are white, the
        arched leaues of a whitish siluer colour, and the vpright
        leaues of a fine blewish purple.

_Diuersitas._    The diuersity or variation of this flower.

        Yet sometimes this doth vary; for the falling leaues will haue
        either an edge of blew, circling the white leaues, the arched
        leaues being a little blewer, and the vpright leaues more
        purple.

        Or the fals will be almost wholly blew, edged with a blewer
        colour, the arched leaues pale blew, and the vpright leaues of
        a purplish blew Violet colour.

        Or the fals white, the arched leaues pale white, as the vpright
        leaues are.

        Of not of so faire a blewish purple, as the first sort is.

        Some of them also will haue larger flowers then others, and be
        more liberall in bearing flowers: for the first sort, which
        is the most ordinary, seldome beareth aboue one flower on a
        stalke, yet sometimes two. And of the others there are some
        that will beare vsually two and three flowers, yet some againe
        will beare but one. All these kindes smell sweeter then many of
        the other, although the most part are without sent.

_Cærulea siue purpurea minor Lusitanica præcox._
 The small early purple Portugall.

        There is another kinde, that is smaller in all the parts
        thereof then the former, the stalke is slender, and not so
        high, bearing at the toppe one or two small flowers, all wholly
        of a faire, blewish purple, with a yellow spot in euery one
        of the three falling leaues, this vsually flowreth early, euen
        with the first bulbous Flowerdeluces.

_Purpurea maior._    The greater purple.

        We haue another purple, whose flower is larger, and stalke
        higher, and is of a very reddish purple colour, a little aboue
        the ground, at the foote or bottome of the leaues and stalke:
        this flowreth with the later sort of Flowerdeluces.

_Purpurea serotina._    The late purple.

        There is another, whose flower is wholly purple, except the
        yellow spot, and flowreth later then any of the other purples.

_Purpurea rubescens labris cæruleis._
 A reddish purple with blew fals.

        There is yet another purple, whose vpright leaues are of a
        reddish purple, and the falling leaues of a blew colour.

_Purpurea rubescens labris albido cæruleis._
 A reddish purple with whitish blew fals.

        And another of a reddish purple, whose falling leaues are of a
        whitish blew colour, in nothing else differing from the last.

_Purpurea labris luteis._    Party coloured purple & yellow.

        Another hath his falling leaues of a faire gold yellow, without
        any stripe, yet in some there are veines running through the
        yellow leaues, and some haue an edge of a sullen darke colour
        about them: the vpright leaues in euery of these, are a Violet
        purple.

_Purpurea labris ex albido cærulea & luteo mixtis._
 Party coloured purple with stript yellow fals.

        Another is altogether like this last, but that the falling
        leaues are of a pale blew and yellow, trauersing one the other,
        and the arched leaues of a pale purplish colour.

_Subpurpurea labris luteis._    Pale purple with yellow fals.

        Another hath his vpright leaues of a paler purple, and the
        falling leaues yellow.

A paler purple.

        And another little differing from it, but that the arched
        leaues are whitish.

_Subcærulea labris luteis._    Party coloured blew and yellow.

        Another whose vpright leaues are of a pale blew, and the
        falling leaues yellow.

        And another of the same sort, but of a little paler blew.

_Crinis coloris elegantioris._    A faire haire colour.

        We haue another sort, whose vpright leaues are of a faire
        brownish yellow colour, which some call a _Fuille mort_, and
        others an haire colour; the falling leaues yellow.

_Altera obsoletior._    A dull haire colour.

        And another of the same colour, but somewhat deader.


_Iris bulbosa Africana serpentriæ caule._
The purple or murrey bulbous Barbary Flowerdeluce.

This Flowerdeluce as it is more strange (that is, but lately knowne
and possessed by a few) so it is both more desired, and of more beauty
then others. It is in all respects, of roote, leafe, and flower, for
the forme like vnto the middle sort of these Flowerdeluces, onely the
lowest part of the leaues and stalke, for an inch or thereabouts, next
vnto the ground, are of a reddish colour, spotted with many spots, and
the flower, being of a meane size, is of a deepe purplish red or murrey
colour the whole flower throughout, except the yellow spot in the
middle of the three lower or falling leaues, as is in all others.

_Purpurea cærulea obsoleta labris fuscis._
 The duskie party coloured purple.

        And lastly, there is another sort, which is the greatest of
        all these narrow leafed Flowerdeluces, in all the parts of it;
        for the roote is greater then any of the other, being thicke
        and short: the leaues are broader and longer, but of the same
        colour: the stalke is stronger and higher then any of them,
        bearing two or three flowers, larger also then any of the rest,
        whose falling leaues are of a duskie yellow, and sometimes with
        veines and borders about the brimmes, of another dunne colour,
        yet hauing that yellow spot that is in all: the arched leaues
        are of a sullen pale purplish yellow, and the vpright leaues of
        a dull or duskie blewish purple colour: the heads or hornes for
        seede are likewise greater, and so is the seede also a little.


        The Place.

        These Flowerdeluces haue had their originall out of Spaine and
        Portugall, as it is thought, except those that haue risen by
        the sowing, and those which are named of Africa.


        The Time.

        These flower in Iune, and sometimes abide vnto Iuly, but
        vsually not so early as the former broad leafed kindes, and are
        soone spoiled with wet in their flowring.


        The Names.

        The seuerall names, both in Latine and English, are sufficient
        for them as they are set downe; for we know no better.


        The Vertues.

        There is not any thing extant or to be heard, that any of
        these kindes of Flowerdeluces hath been vsed to any Physicall
        purposes, and serue onely to decke vp the Gardens of the
        curious.

And thus much for these sorts of bulbous Flowerdeluces, and yet I
doubt not, but that there are many differences, which haue risen by
the sowing of the seede, as many may obserue from their owne labours,
for that euery yeare doth shew forth some variety that is not seene
before. And now I will conuert my discourse a while likewise, to passe
through the seuerall rankes of the other kindes of tuberous rooted
Flowerdeluces, called Flagges.




CHAP. XX.

_Iris latifolia tuberosa._   The Flagge or Flowerdeluce.


There are two principall kindes of tuberous or knobby rooted
Flowerdeluces, that is, the tall and the dwarfe, or the greater and
the lesser; the former called _Iris maior_ or _latifolia_, and the
other _Iris minor_, or rather _Chamæiris_; and each of these haue their
lesser or narrow leafed kindes to bee comprehended vnder them: Of all
which in their order. And first of that Flowerdeluce, which for his
excellent beautie and raritie, deserueth the first place.


_Iris Chalcedonica siue Susiana maior._
The great Turkie Flowerdeluce.

The great Turkie Flowerdeluce, hath diuers heads of long and broad
fresh greene leaues, yet not so broad as many other of those that
follow, one folded within another at the bottome, as all other of these
Flowerdeluces are: from the middle of some one of those heads (for
euery head of leaues beareth not a flower) riseth vp a round stiffe
stalke, two foote high, at the toppe whereof standeth one flower (for I
neuer obserued it to beare two) the largest almost, but rarest of all
the rest, consisting of nine leaues, like the others that follow, but
of the colour almost of a Snakes skinne, it is so diuersly spotted;
for the three lower falling leaues are very large, of a deepe or darke
purple colour, almost blacke, full of grayish spots, strakes, and
lines through the whole leaues, with a blacke thrume or freeze in the
middle of each of them: the three arched leaues that couer them, are
of the same darke purple colour, yet a little paler at the sides, the
three vpper leaues are very large also, and of the same colour with the
lower leaues, but a little more liuely and fresh, being speckled and
straked with whiter spots and lines; which leaues being laid in water,
will colour the water into a Violet colour, but if a little Allome be
put therein, and then wrung or pressed, and the iuice of these leaues
dryed in the shadow, will giue a colour almost as deepe as Indico, and
may serue for shawdowes in limming excellent well: the flower hath no
sent that can be perceiued, but is onely commendable for the beauty
and rarity thereof: it seldome beareth seedes in these cold Countries,
but when it doth, it is contained in great heads, being brownish and
round, but not so flat as in other sorts, the roots are more browne on
the outside, and growing tuberous thicke, as all other that are kept in
Gardens.


_Iris Chalcedonica siue Susiana minor._
The lesser Turkie Flowerdeluce.

There is another hereof little differing, but that the leafe is of a
more yellowish greene colour, and the flower neither so large or faire,
nor of so perspicuous markes and spots, nor the colour of that liuely
(though darke) lustre.


        The Place.

        These haue been sent out of Turkie diuers times among other
        things, and it should seeme, that they haue had their originall
        from about Susis, a chiefe Citie of Persia.


        The Time.

        They flower in May most vsually, before any of the other kindes.


        The Names.

        They haue been sent vnto vs, and vnto diuers other in other
        parts, from Constantinople vnder the name of _Alaia Susiana_,
        and thereupon it hath been called, both of them and vs, either
        _Iris Chalcedonica_, or _Susiana_, and for distinction _maior_
        or _minor_: In English, The Turkie Flowerdeluce, or the Ginnie
        Hen Flowerdeluce, the greater or the lesser.


_Iris alba Florentina._   The white Flowerdeluce.

The great white Flowerdeluce, hath many heads of very broad and flat
long leaues, enclosing or folding one within another at the bottome,
and after a little diuided one from another toward the top, thin edged,
like a sword on both sides, and thicker in the middle: from the middle
of some of these heads of leaues, riseth vp a round stiffe stalk,
two or three foot high, bearing at the top one, two, or three large
flowers, out of seuerall huskes or skins, consisting of nine leaues,
as all the other do, of a faire white colour, hauing in the middle of
each of the three falling leaues, a small long yellow frize or thrume,
as is most vsuall in all the sorts of the following Flowerdeluces, both
of the greater and smaller kindes: after the flowers are past, come
the seed, inclosed in thicke short pods, full fraught or stored with
red roundish and flat seede, lying close one vpon another: the roote
is tuberous or knobby, shooting out from euery side much like tuberous
heads, lying for the most part vpon or aboue the ground, and fastened
within the ground with long white strings or fibres, which hold them

[Sidenote: _Flore pallido._]

strongly, and encreaseth fast. There is another like vnto this last in
all things, sauing that the colour of the flower is of a more yellowish
white, which we vsually call a Straw colour.


_Iris alba maior versicolor._   The white party coloured Flowerdeluce.

This variable Flowerdeluce is like vnto the former, but that the leaues
are not so large and broad, the flower hereof is as large almost, and
as white as the former, but it hath a faire list or line of a blewish
purple downe the backe of euery one of the three vpright leaues, and
likewise round about the edges, both of the vpper and lower leaues, and
also a little more purplish vpon the ridge of the arched leaues, that
couer the falling leaues: the roote hereof is not so great as of the
former white, but a little slenderer and browner.


_Iris Dalmatica maior._   The great Dalmatian Flowerdeluce.

This greater Flowerdeluce of Dalmatia, hath his leaues as large and
broad as any of the Flowerdeluces whatsoeuer, his stalke and flower
doe equall his other proportion, onely the colour of the flower is
differing, being of a faire watchet or bleake blew colour wholly,
with the yellow frize or thrum downe the middle of the lower or
falling leaues, as before is said to be common to all these sorts of
Flowerdeluces; in all other parts it little differeth, sauing onely
this is obserued to haue a small shew of a purplish red about the
bottome of the greene leaues.


_Iris purpurea siue vulgaris._   The common purple Flowerdeluce.

This Flowerdeluce, which is most common in Gardens, differeth nothing
at all from those that are formerly described, either in roote, leafe,
or flower for the forme of them, but onely that the leaues of this
are not so large as the last, and the flower it selfe is of a deep
purple or Violet colour, and sometimes a little declining to rednesse,
especially in some places.

[Sidenote: _Purpurea pallidior versicolor._]

Sometimes this kinde of Flowerdeluce will haue flowers of a paler
purple colour, comming neare vnto a blew, and sometimes it will haue
veines or stripes of a deeper blew, or purple, or ash-colour, running
through all the vpper and lower leaues.

[Sidenote: _Cærulea labris purpureis._]

There is another like vnto this, but more purple in the fals, and more
pale in the vpright leaues.


_Iris Asiatica cærulea._   The blew Flowerdeluce of Asia.

This Flowerdeluce of Asia, is in largenesse of leaues like vnto the
Dalmatian, but beareth more store of flowers on seuerall branches,
which are of a deeper blew colour, and the arched leaues whitish on the
side, and purplish on the ridges, but in other things like vnto it.

[Sidenote: _Purpurea._]

There is another neare vnto this, but that his leaues are a little
narrower, and his flowers a little more purple, especially the vpper
leaues.


_Iris Damascena._   The Flowerdeluce of Damasco.

This is likewise altogether like the Flowerdeluce of Asia, but that it
hath some white veines in the vpright leaues.


_Iris Lusitanica biflora._   The Portugall Flowerdeluce.

This Portugall Flowerdeluce is very like the common purple
Flowerdeluce, but that this is not so large in leaues, or flowers,
and that it doth often flower twice in a yeare, that is, both in the
Spring, and in the Autumne againe, and besides, the flowers haue a
better or sweeter sent, but of the like purple or Violet colour as it
is, and comming forth out of purplish skins or huskes.


_Iris Camerarij siue purpurea versicolor maior._
The greater variable coloured purple Flowerdeluce.

The greater of the variable purple Flowerdeluces, hath very broad
leaues, like vnto the leaues of the common purple Flowerdeluce, and so
is the flower also, but differing in colour, for the three lower leaues
are of a deepe purple colour tending to rednesse, the three arched
leaues are of the colour with the vpper leaues, which are of a pale
or bleake colour tending to yellownesse, shadowed ouer with a smoakie
purplish colour, except the ridges of the arched leaues, which are of a
more liuely purple colour.


_Iris purpurea versicolor minor._
The lesser variable purple Flowerdeluce.

This Flowerdeluce differeth not in any thing from the last, but onely
that it hath narrower greene leaues, and smaller and narrower flowers,
else if they be both conferred together, the colours will not seeme to
varie the one from the other any whit at all.

[Sidenote: _Altera minus fuliginea._]

There is another somewhat neare vnto these two last kindes, whose
huskes from whence the flowers doe shoote forth, haue purple veines in
them, and so haue the falling purplish leaues, and the three vpright
leaues are not so smoakie, yet of a dun purple colour.


_Iris cærulea versicolor._   The blew party coloured Flowerdeluce.

This party coloured Flowerdeluce hath his leaues of the same
largenesse, with the lesser variable purple Flowerdeluce last
described, and his flowers diuersly marked: for some haue the fals
blew at the edges, and whitish at the bottome, the arched leaues of
a yellowish white, and the vpright leaues of a whitish blew, with
yellowish edges. Some againe are of a darker blew, with brownish spots
in them. And some are so pale a blew, that we may well call it an
ash-colour: And lastly, there is another of this sort, whose vpright
leaues are of a faire pale blew, with yellowish edges, and the falling
leaues parted into two colours, sometimes equally in the halfe, each
side sutable to the other in colour: And sometimes hauing the one leafe
in that manner: And sometimes but with a diuers coloured list in them;
in the other parts both of flower and leafe, like vnto the other.


_Iris lutea variegata._   The yellow variable Flowerdeluce.

This yellow variable Flowerdeluce loseth his leaues in Winter, contrary
to all the former Flowerdeluces, so that his roote remaineth vnder
ground without any shew of leafe vpon it: but in the beginning of the
Spring it shooteth out faire broad leaues, falling downwards at the
points or ends, but shorter many times then any of the former, and so
is the stalke likewise, not rising much aboue a foote high, whereon are
set two or three large flowers, whose falling leaues are of a reddish
purple colour, the three that stand vpright of a smoakie yellow, the
arched leaues hauing their ridges of a bleake colour tending to purple,
the sides being of the former smoakie yellow colour, with some purplish
veines at the foote or bottome of all the leaues: the roote groweth
somewhat more slender and long vnder ground, and of a darker colour
then manie of the other.

Another sort hath the vpright leaues of a reasonable faire yellow,
and stand more vpright, not bowing downe as most of the other, and

[Sidenote: _Varietas._]

the purple fals haue pale edges. Some haue their greene leaues party
coloured, white and greene, more or lesse, and so are the huskes of
the flowers, the arched leaues yellow, as the vpright leaues are,
with purplish veines at the bottome. And some haue both the arched
and vpright leaues of so pale a yellow, that we may almost call it a
straw colour, but yellower at the bottome, with purple veines, and the
falling leaues purple, with two purple spots in them.

And these are the sorts of the greater tuberous or Flagge Flowerdeluces
that haue come to our knowledge: the next hereunto are the lesser or
narrow leafed kindes to be described; and first of the greatest of them.


1. _Iris angustifolia Tripolitana aurea._
The yellow Flowerdeluce of Tripoly.

This Flowerdeluce I place in the forefront of the narrow leafed
Flowerdeluces, for the length of the leaues, compared with the breadth
of them; it may fitly bee called a narrow leafed Flowerdeluce, although
they be an inch broad, which is broader then any of them that follow,
or some of those are set downe before, but as I said, the length make
them seem narrow, and therefore let it take vp his roome in this place,
with the description that followeth. It beareth leaues a yard long, or
not much lesse, and an inch broad, as is said before, or more, of a sad
greene colour, but not shining: the stalke riseth vp to be foure of
fiue foote high, being strong and round, but not very great, bearing
at the toppe two or three long and narrow gold yellow flowers, of the
fashion of the bulbous Flowerdeluces, as the next to bee described is,
without any mixture or variation therein: the heads for seede are three
square, containing within them many flat cornered seedes: the roote
is long and blackish, like vnto the rest that follow, but greater and
fuller.


[Illustration:

   1 _Iris Chalcedonica siue Susiana maior._ The great Turkie
        Flowerdeluce.
   2 _Iris alba Florentina._ The white Flowerdeluce.
   3 _Iris latifolia variegata._ The variable Flowerdeluce.
   4 _Chamæiris latifolia maior._ The greater dwarfe Flowerdeluce.
]


2. _Iris angustifolia maior cærulea._
The greater blew Flowerdeluce with narrow leaues.

This kinde of Flowerdeluce hath his leaues very long and narrow, of a
whitish greene colour, but neither so long or broad as the last, yet
broader, thicker and stiffer then any of the rest with narrow leaues
that follow: the stalke riseth sometimes no higher then the leaues,
and sometimes a little higher, bearing diuers flowers at the top,
successiuely flowring one after another, and are like vnto the flowers
of the bulbous Flowerdeluces, but of a light blew colour, and sometimes
deeper: after the flowers are past, rise vp six cornered heads, which
open into three parts, wherein is contained browne seede, almost round:
the roote is small, blackish and hard, spreading into many long heads,
and more closely growing or matting together.


3. _Iris angustifolia purpurea marina._
The purple narrow leafed Sea Flowerdeluce.

This Sea Flowerdeluce hath many narrow hard leaues as long as the
former, and of a darke greene colour, which doe smell a little strong:
the stalke beareth two or three flowers like the former, but somewhat
lesse, and of a darke purple or Violet colour: in seede and roote it is
like the former.


4. _Iris angustifolia purpurea versicolor._
The variable purple narrow leafed Flowerdeluce.

The leaues of this Flowerdeluce are very like the former Sea
Flowerdeluce, and do a little stinke like them; the flowers are
differing, in that the vpper leaues are wholly purple or violet, and
the lower leaues haue white veines, and purple running one among
another: the seede and rootes differ not from the former purple Sea
kinde.


5. _Iris angustifolia minor Pannonica siue versicolor Clusij._
The small variable Hungarian Flowerdeluce of Clusius.

This Hungarian Flowerdeluce (first found out by Clusius, by him
described, and of him tooke the name) riseth vp with diuers small tufts
of leaues, very long, narrow, and greene, growing thicke together,
especially if it abide any time in a place; among which riseth vp many
long round stalkes, higher then the leaues, bearing two or three, or
foure small flowers, one aboue another, like the former, but smaller
and of greater beauty: for the lower leaues are variably striped with
white and purple, without any thrume or fringe at all; the vpper leaues
are of a blewish fine purple or Violet colour, & so are the arched
leaues, yet hauing the edges a little paler: the heads for seede are
smaller, and not so cornered as the other, containing seedes much
like the former, but smaller: the roote is blacke and small, growing
thicker and closer together then any other, and strongly fastened in
the ground, with a number of hard stringie rootes: the flowers are of a
reasonable good sent.


6. _Iris angustifolia maior flore duplici._
The greater double blew Flowerdeluce.

This Flowerdeluce, differeth not either in roote or leafe from the
first great blew Flowerdeluce of Clusius, but onely in that the leaues
grow thicker together, and that the flowers of this kinde are as it
were double with many leaues confusedly set together, without any
distinct parts of a Flowerdeluce, and of a faire blew colour with many
white veines and lines running in the leaues; yet oftentimes the stalke
of flowers hath but two or three small flowers distinctly set together,
rising as it were out of one huske.

        with narrow leaues.
   3 _Iris angustifolia minor Pannonica siue versicolor Clusii._ The
        small variable Hungarian Flowerdeluce of Clusius.
   4 _Iris angustifolia maior flore duplici._ The greater double blew
        Flowerdeluce.

]


7. _Iris angustifolia minor alba Clusij._
The small white Flowerdeluce of Hungary.

This likewise differeth little from the former Hungarian Flowerdeluce
of Clusius, but that the leafe is of a little paler greene colour,
and the flower is of a faire whitish colour, with some purple at the
bottome of the leaues.

Next after these narrow leafed Flowerdeluces, are the greater and
smaller sorts of dwarfe kindes to follow; and lastly, the narrow
or grasse leafed dwarfe kindes, which will finish this Chapter of
Flowerdeluces.


1. _Chamæiris latifolia maior alba._
The greater white dwarfe Flowerdeluce.

This dwarfe Flowerdeluce hath his leaues as broad as some of the lesser
kindes last mentioned, but not shorter; the stalke is very short,
not aboue halfe a foote high or thereabouts, bearing most commonly
but one flower, seldome two, which are in some of a pure white, in
others paler, or somewhat yellowish through the whole flower, except
the yellow frize or thrume in the middle of euery one of the falling
leaues: after the flowers are past, come forth great heads, containing
within them round pale seed: the roote is small, according to the
proportion of the plant aboue ground, but made after the fashion of
the greater kindes, with tuberous peeces spreading from the sides, and
strong fibres or strings, whereby they are fastened in the ground.


2. _Chamæiris latifolia maior purpurea._
The greater purple dwarfe Flowerdeluce.

There is no difference either in roote, leafe, or forme of flower in
this from the former dwarfe kinde, but onely in the colour of the
flower, which in some is of a very deepe or blacke Violet purple, both
the toppes and the fals: in others the Violet purple is more liuely,
and in some the vpper leaues are blew, and the lower leaues purple,
yet all of them haue that yellow frize or thrume in the middle of the
falling leaues, that the other kindes haue.

[Sidenote: _Altera._]

There is another that beareth purple flowers, that might be reckoned,
for the smalnesse and shortnesse of his stalke, to the next kinde, but
that the flowers and leaues of this are as large as any of the former
kindes of the smaller Flowerdeluces.


3. _Chamæiris latifolia minor alba._
The lesser white dwarfe Flowerdeluce.

There is also another sort of these Flowerdeluces, whose leaues and
flowers are lesse, and wherein there is much variety. The leaues of
this kinde, are all for the most part somewhat smaller, narrower, and
shorter then the former: the stalke with the flower vpon it scarce
riseth above the leaues, so that in most of them it may be rather
called a foote-stalke, such as the Saffron flowers haue, and are
therefore called of manie ἄκαυλοι, without stalkes; the flowers are
like vnto the first described of the dwarfe kindes, and of a whitish
colour, with a few purplish lines at the bottome of the vpper leaues,
and a list of greene in the falling leaues.

[Sidenote: _Straminea._]

Another hath the flowers of a pale yellow, called a Straw colour, with
whitish stripes and veines in the fals, and purplish lines at the
bottome of the vpper leaues.


4. _Chamæiris latifolia minor purpurea._
The lesser purple dwarfe Flowerdeluce.

The difference of this from the former, consisteth more in the colour
then forme of the flower, which is of a deep Violet purple, sometimes
paler, and sometimes so deep, that it almost seemeth blacke: And
sometimes the fals purplish, and the vpper leaues blew. Some of these
haue a sweete sent, and some none.

[Sidenote: _Cærulea._]

There is another of a fine pale or delayed blew colour throughout the
whole flower.


5. _Chamæiris latifolia minor suauerubens._
The lesser blush coloured dwarfe Flowerdeluce.

This Flowerdeluce hath the falling leaues of the flower of a reddish
colour, and the thrumes blew: the vpper and arched leaues of a fine
pale red or flesh colour, called a blush colour; in all other things it
differeth not, and smelleth little or nothing at all.


6. _Chamæiris latifolia minor lutea versicolor._
The lesser yellow variable dwarfe Flowerdeluce.

The falling leaues of this Flowerdeluce are yellowish, with purple
lines from the middle downewards, sometimes of a deeper, and sometimes
of a paler colour, and white thrumes in the middle, the vpper leaues
are likewise of a yellowish colour, with purple lines in them: And
sometimes the yellow colour is paler, and the lines both in the vpper
and lower leaues of a dull or dead purple colour.


7. _Chamæiris latifolia minor cærulea versicolor._
The lesser blew variable dwarfe Flowerdeluce.

The vpper leaues of this flower are of a blewish yellow colour, spotted
with purple in the broad part, and at the bottome very narrow: the
falling leaues are spread ouer with pale purplish lines, and a small
shew of blew about the brimmes: the thrume is yellow at the bottome,
and blewish aboue: the arched leaues are of a blewish white, being a
little deeper on the ridge.

And sometimes the vpper leaues are of a paler blew rather whitish, with
the yellow: both these haue no sent at all.


8. _Chamæiris marina purpurea._   The purple dwarfe Sea Flowerdeluce.

This small Flowerdeluce is like vnto the narrow leafed Sea Flowerdeluce
before described, both in roote, leafe, and flower, hauing no other
difference, but in the smalnesse and lownesse of the growing, being of
the same purple colour with it.


9. _Chamæiris angustifolia maior._   The greater Grasse Flowerdeluce.

This Grasse Flowerdeluce hath many long and narrow darke greene leaues,
not so stiffe as the former, but lither, and bending their ends downe
againe, among which rise vp diuers stalkes, bearing at the toppe two
or three sweete flowers, as small as any of them set downe before, of
a reddish purple colour, with whitish yellow and purple strakes downe
the middle of the falling leaues: the arched leaues are of a horse
flesh colour all along the edges, and purple vpon the ridges and tips
that turne vp againe: vnder these appeare three browne aglets, like
vnto birds tongues: the three vpper leaues are small and narrow, of a
perfect purple or Violet colour: the heads for seede haue sharper and
harder cornered edges then the former: the seedes are somewhat grayish
like the former, and so are the rootes, being small, blacke, and hard,
growing thicke together, fastened in the ground with small blackish
hard strings, which hardly shoote againe if the roote be remoued.


10. _Chamæiris angustifolia minor._   The lesser Grasse Flowerdeluce.

This Flowerdeluce is in leaues, flowers, and rootes so like the last
described, that but onely it is smaller and lower, it is not to be
distinguished from the other. And this may suffice for these sorts of
Flowerdeluces, that furnish the Gardens of the curious louers of these
varieties of nature, so farre forth as hath passed vnder our knowledge.
There are some other that may be referred hereunto, but they belong to
another history; and therefore I make no mention of them in this place.


        The Place.

        The places of most of these are set downe in their seuerall
        titles; for some are out of Turkie, others out of Hungaria,
        Dalmatia, Illyria, &c. as their names doe import. Those that
        grow by the Sea, are found in Spaine and France.


        The Time.

        Some of these do flower in Aprill, some in May, and some not
        vntill Iune.


        The Names.

        The names expressed are the fittest agreeing vnto them, and
        therefore it is needlesse againe to repeate them. Many of the
        rootes of the former or greater kindes, being dryed are sweete,
        yet some more then other, and some haue no sent at all: but
        aboue all the rest, that with the white flower, called of
        Florence, is accounted of all to be the sweetest root, fit to
        be vsed to make sweete powders, &c. calling it by the name of
        _Orris_ rootes.


_Iris tuberosa._   The Veluet Flowerdeluce.

Vnto the Family of Flowerdeluces, I must needes ioyne this peculiar
kinde, because of the neare resemblance of the flower, although it
differ both in roote and leafe; lest therefore it should haue no place,
let it take vp a roome here in the end of the Flowerdeluces, with this
description following. It hath many small and foure square leaues, two
foote long and aboue sometimes, of a grayish greene colour, stiffe
at the first, but afterwards growing to their full length, they are
weak and bend downe to the ground: out of the middle, as it were of
one of these leaues, breaketh out the stalke, a foot high and better,
with some leaues thereon, at the toppe whereof, out of a huske riseth
one flower, (I neuer saw more on a stalke) consisting of nine leaues,
whereof the three that fall downe are of a yellowish greene colour
round about the edges, and in the middle of so deepe a purple, that
it seemeth to be blacke, resembling blacke Veluet: the three arched
leaues, that couer the lower leaues to the halfe, are of the same
greenish colour that the edges and backside of the lower leaues are:
the three vppermost leaues, if they may be called leaues, or rather
short peeces like eares, are green also, but wherein a glimpse of
purple may be seene in them: after the flower is past, there followeth
a round knob or whitish seede vessell, hanging downe by a small
foote-stalke, from betweene the huske, which is diuided as it were
into two leaues, wherein is contained round white seede. The roote
is bunched or knobbed out into long round rootes, like vnto fingers,
two or three from one peece, one distant from another, and one longer
then another, for the most part of a darkish gray colour, and reddish
withall on the outside, and somewhat yellowish within.


        The Place.

        It hath beene sent out of Turkie oftentimes (as growing
        naturally thereabouts) and not knowne to grow naturally any
        where else.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in Aprill or May, sometimes earlier or later, as
        the Spring falleth out to be milde or sharpe.


        The Names.

        Matthiolus contendeth to make it the true _Hermodadactylus_,
        rather from the shew of the rootes, which (as is said) are
        like vnto fingers, then from any other good reason: for the
        rootes hereof eyther dry or greene, do nothing resemble the
        true _Hermodactyli_ that are vsed in Physicke, as any that
        knoweth them may easily perceiue, either in forme or vertue. It
        is more truely referred to the Flowerdeluces, and because of
        the tuberous rootes, called _Iris tuberosa_, although all the
        Flowerdeluces in this Chapter haue tuberous rootes, yet this
        much differing from them all. In English it is vsually called,
        The Veluet Flowerdeluce, because the three falling leaues seeme
        to be like smooth blacke Veluet.


        The Vertues.

        Both the rootes and the flowers of the great Flowerdeluces,
        are of great vse for the purging and cleansing of many inward,
        as well as outward diseases, as all Authors in Physicke doe
        record. Some haue vsed also the greene rootes to cleanse the
        skinne, but they had neede to be carefull that vse them, lest
        they take more harme then good by the vse of them. The dryed
        rootes called _Orris_ (as is said) is of much vse to make
        sweete powders, or other things to perfume apparrell or linnen.
        The iuice or decoction of the green roots doth procure both
        neezing to be snuft vp into the nostrils, and vomiting very
        strongly being taken inwardly.




CHAP. XXI.

_Gladiolus._   Corne Flagge.


Next vnto the Flagges or Flowerdeluces, come the _Gladioli_ or Corne
Flagges to bee entreated of, for some resemblance of the leaues with
them. There are hereof diuers sorts, some bigger and some lesser, but
the chiefest difference is in the colour of the flowers, and one in the
order of the flowers. Of them all in their seuerall orders.


_Gladiolus narbonensis._   The French Corne Flagge.

The French Corne Flagge riseth vp with three or foure broad, long,
and stiffe greene leaues, one as it were out of the side of another,
being ioyned together at the bottome, somewhat like vnto the leaues
of Flowerdeluces, but stiffer, more full of ribbes, and longer then
many of them, and sharper pointed: the stalke riseth vp from among the
leaues, bearing them on it as it riseth, hauing at the toppe diuers
huskes, out of which come the flowers one aboue another, all of them
turning and opening themselues one way, which are long and gaping,
like vnto the flowers of Foxegloue, a little arched or bunching vp in
the middle, of a faire reddish purple colour, with two white spots
within the mouth thereof, one on each side, made like vnto a Lozenge
that is square and long pointed: after the flowers are past, come vp
round heads or seede vessels, wherein is contained reddish flat seede,
like vnto the seede of the Fritillaria, but thicker and fuller: the
roote is somewhat great, round, flat, and hard, with a shew as if it
were netted, hauing another short spongie one vnder it, which when it
hath done bearing, and the stalke dry, that the roote may be taken vp,
sticketh close to the bottome, but may be easily taken away, hauing
vsually a number of small rootes encreased about it, the least whereof
will quickly grow, so that if it be suffered any long time in a Garden,
it will rather choake and pester it, then be an ornament vnto it.


_Gladiolus Italicus binis florum ordinibus._
The Italian Corne Flagge.

The Italian Corne Flagge is like vnto the French in roote, leafe, and
flower, without any other difference, then that the roote is smaller
and browner, the leafe and stalke of a darker colour, and the flowers
(being of a little darker colour like the former, and somewhat smaller)
stand out on both sides of the stalke.


_Gladiolus Byzantinus._   Corne Flagge of Constantinople.

This Corne Flagge that came first from Constantinople, is in all
things like vnto the French Corne Flagge last described, but that it
is larger, both in rootes, leaues, and flowers, and likewise that the
Flowers of this, which stand not on both sides, are of a deeper red
colour, and flower later, after all the rest are past: the roote hereof
being netted as plainly as any of the former, is as plentifull also to
giue encrease, but is more tender and lesse able to abide our sharpe
cold Winters.


_Gladiolus flore rubente._   Blush Corne Flagge.

This blush kinde is like vnto the French Corne Flagge in all respects,
sauing onely that the flowers are of a pale red colour, tending to
whitenesse, which wee vsually call a blush colour.


_Gladiolus flore albo._   White Corne Flagge.

This white Corne Flagge also differeth not from the last, but onely
that the rootes are whiter on the outside, the leaues are greener,
without any brownesse or darknesse as in the former, and the flowers
are snow white.


_Gladiolus purpureus minor._   The small purple Corne Flagge.

This also differeth not from any of the former, but onely in the
smallnesse both of leafe, stalke, and flowers, which stand all on the
one side, like vnto the French kinde, and of the same colour: the roote
of this kinde is netted more then any other.


        The Place.

        They grow in France and Italy, the least in Spaine, and the
        Byzantine, as it is thought, about Constantinople, being (as
        is said) first sent from thence. Iohn Tradescante assured mee,
        that hee saw many acres of ground in Barbary spread ouer with
        them.


        The Time.

        They all flower in Iune and Iuly, and the Byzantine latest, as
        is said before.


        The Names.

        It hath diuers names; for the Latines call it _Gladiolus_,
        of the forme of a sword, which the leafe doth resemble. The
        Romanes _Segetalis_, because it groweth in the Corne fields.
        Some call it _Victorialis rotunda_, to put a difference between
        it, and the _longa_, which is a kinde of Garlicke. Plinie
        saith, that _Gladiolus_ is _Cypirus_, but to decide that
        controuersie, and many others, belongeth to another discourse,
        this being intended only for pleasure. Gerrard mistaketh the
        French kinde for the Italian.


        The Vertues.

        The roote being bruised, and applyed with Frankinsense (and
        often of it selfe without it) in the manner of a pultis or
        plaister, is held of diuers to be singular good to draw out
        splinters, thornes, and broken bones out of the flesh. Some
        take it be effectuall to stirre vp Venerie, but I somewhat
        doubt thereof: For Galen in his eighth Booke of Simples, giueth
        vnto it a drawing, digesting and drawing faculty.

CHAP. XXII.

_Orchis siue Satyrium._   Bee flowers.


Although it is not my purpose in this place, to giue a generall history
of all the sorts of Orchides, Satyrions, and the rest of that kinde;
yet because many of them are very pleasant to behold, and, if they be
planted in a conuenient place, will abide some time in Gardens, so that
there is much pleasure taken in them: I shall intrude some of them
for curiosities sake, to make vp the prospect of natures beautifull
variety, and only entreate of a few, leauing the rest to a more ample
declaration.


1. _Satyrium Basilicum siue Palma Christi mas._
The greater male handed Satyrion.

This handed Satyrion hath for the most part but three faire large
greene leaues, neare vnto the ground, spotted with small blackish
markes: from among which riseth vp a stalke, with some smaller leaues
thereon, bearing at the toppe a bush or spike of flowers, thicke set
together, euery one whereof is made like a body, with the belly broader
belowe then aboue, where it hath small peeces adioyned vnto it: the
flower is of a faire purple colour, spotted with deeper purple spots,
and hauing small peeces like hornes hanging at the backes of the
flowers, and a small leafe at the bottome of the foote-stalke of euery
flower: the rootes are not round, like the other Orchides, but somewhat
long and flat, like a hand, with small diuisions belowe, hanging downe
like the fingers of a hand, cut short off by the knockles, two alwayes
growing together, with some small fibres or strings aboue the heads of
these rootes, at the bottome of the stalke.


2. _Satyrium Basilicum siue Palma Christi fæmina._
The female handed Satyrion.

This female Satyrion hath longer and narrower leaues then the former,
and spotted with more and greater spots, compassing the stalke at the
bottome like the other: this beareth likewise a bush of flowers, like
vnto the other, but that each of these haue heads like hoods, whereas
the former haue none: in some they are white with purple spots, and in
others of a reddish purple, with deepe or darke coloured spots: the
roots are alike.


3. _Orchis Hermaphroditica candida._   The white Butterflie Orchis.

The rootes of this kinde take part with both the sorts of _Orchis_
and _Satyrium_, being neither altogether round, nor fully handed, and
thereupon it tooke the name, to signifie both kindes: the leaues are
two in number, seldome more, being faire and broad, like vnto the
leaues of Lillies, without any spot at all in them: at the toppe of
the stalke stand many white flowers, not so thicke set as the first or
second, euery one being fashioned like vnto a white Butterflie, with
the wings spread abroad.


4. _Orchis Melitias siue apifera._   The Bee flower or Bee Orchis.

This is a small and lowe plant for the most part, with three or foure
small narrow leaues at the bottome: the stalke is seldome above halfe
a foote high, with foure or fiue flowers thereon one aboue another,
hauing round bodies, and somewhat flat, of a kind of yellowish colour,
with purple wings aboue them, so like vnto an honey Bee, that it might
soone deceiue one that neuer had seene such a flower before: the roots
are two together, round and white, hauing a certaine _muccilaginesse_
or clamminesse within them, without any taste almost at all, as all or
the most part of these kindes haue.


5. _Orchis Sphegodes._   Gnats Satyrion.

The leaues of this Orchis are somewhat larger then of the Bee flower,
the stalke also somewhat higher: the flowers are fewer on the toppe,
but somewhat larger then of the Bee flowers, made to the resemblance
of a Gnat or great long Flie: the rootes are two round bulbes, as the
other are.


6. _Orchis Myodes._   Flie Orchis.

The Flie Orchis is like vnto the last described, both in leafe and
roote, the difference is in the flower, which is neither so long as the
Gnat Satyrion, nor so great as the Bee Orchis, but the neather part of
the Flie is blacke, with a list of ash-colour crossing the backe, with
a shew of legges hanging at it: the naturall Flie seemeth so to bee in
loue with it, that you shall seldome come in the heate of the day, but
you shall finde one sitting close thereon.


        The Place.

        These grow in many places of England, some in the Woods, as the
        Butterflie, and the two former handed Satyrions: others on dry
        bankes and barren balkes in Kent, and many other places.


        The Time.

        They flower for the most part in the beginning or middle of
        May, or thereabouts.


        The Names.

        Their seuerall names are expressed in their titles, so much as
        may suffice for this discourse.


        The Vertues.

        All the kindes of Orchis are accounted to procure bodily lust,
        as well the flowers distilled, as the rootes prepared.

        The rootes boyled in red Wine, and afterwards dryed, are held
        to bee a singular good remedie against the bloody Flixe.




CHAP. XXIII.

_Dens Caninus._   Dogs tooth Violet.


Vnto the kindes of Orchides, may fitly be ioyned another plant, which
by many is reckoned to be a _Satyrium_, both from the forme of roote
and leafe, and from the efficacy or vertue correspondent thereunto. And
although it cannot be the _Satyrium Erythronium_ of Dioscorides, as
some would entitle it, for that as I haue shewed before, his _Satyrium
tryphillum_ is the Tulipa without all doubt; yet because it differeth
very notably, and carrieth more beauty and respect in his flower then
they, I shall entreate thereof in a Chapter by it selfe, and set it
next vnto them.


_Dens Caninus flore albo._   Dogs tooth Violet with a white flower.

The white Dogs tooth hath for his roote a white bulbe, long and small,
yet vsually greater then either of the other that follow, bigger belowe
then aboue, with a small peece adioyning to the bottome of it, from
whence rise vp in the beginning of the Spring, after the Winter frosts
are past, two leaues for the most part (when it will flower, or else
but one, and neuer three together that euer I saw) closed together
when they first come vp out of the ground, which inclose the flower
betweene them: the leaues when they are opened do lay themselues flat
on the ground, or not much aboue it, one opposite vnto the other, with
the stalke and the flower on it standing betweene them, which leaues
are of a whitish greene colour, long and narrow, yet broader in the
middle then at both ends, growing lesse by degrees each way, spotted
and striped all ouer the leaues with white lines and spots: the stalke
riseth vp halfe a foote high or more, bearing at the toppe one flower
and no more, hanging downe the head, larger then any of the other of
this kinde that follow, made or consisting of six white long and narrow
leaues, turning themselues vp againe, after it hath felt the comfort of
the Sunne, that they doe almost touch the stalke againe, very like vnto
the flowers of _Cyclamen_ or Sowebread: it hath in the middle of the
flower six white chiues, tipt with darke purple pendents, and a white
three forked stile in the middle of them: the flower hath no sent at
all, but commendable onely for the beauty and forme thereof: after the
flower is past, commeth in the place a round head seeming three square,
containing therein small and yellowish seede.


_Dens Caninus flore purpurascente._
Dogs tooth with a pale purple flower.

This other Dogs tooth is like vnto the former, but lesser in all parts,
the leafe whereof is not so long, but broad and short, spotted with
darker lines and spots: the flower is like the other, but smaller, and
of a delayed purple colour, very pale sometimes, and sometimes a little
deeper, turning it selfe as the other, with a circle round about the
vmbone or middle, the chiues hereof are not white, but declining to
purple: the roote is white, and like vnto the former, but lesser, as is
said before.


_Dens Caninus flore rubro._   Dogs tooth with a red flower.

This is in all things like vnto the last, both for forme and bignesse
of flower and leafe: the chiefe difference consisteth in this, that
the leaues hereof are of a yellowish mealy greene colour, spotted and
streaked with redder spots and stripes, and the flower of a deeper
reddish purple colour, and the chiues also more purplish then the last,
in all other things it is alike.


        The Place.

        The sorts _Dens Caninus_ doe growe in diuers places; some
        in Italy on the Euganean Hils, others on the Apenine, and
        some about Gratz, the chiefe Citie of Stiria, and also about
        Bayonne, and in other places.


        The Time.

        They flower in March most vsually, and many times in Aprill,
        according to the seasonablenesse of the yeare.


        The Names.

        Clusius did call it first _Dentali_, and Lobel, and from him
        some others _Satyrium_, and _Erythronium_, but I haue said
        enough hereof in the beginning of the Chapter. It is most
        commonly called _Dens Caninus_, and we in English, either Dogs
        tooth, or Dogs tooth Violet. Gesner called it _Hermodactylus_,
        and Matthiolus _Pseudohermodactylus_.


        The Vertues.

        The roote hereof is held to bee of more efficacy for venerous
        effects, then any of the Orchides and Satyrions.

        They of Stiria vse the rootes for the falling sicknesse.

        Wee haue had from Virginia a roote sent vnto vs, that wee might
        well iudge, by the forme and colour thereof being dry, to be
        either the roote of this, or of an Orchis, which the naturall
        people hold not onely to be singular to procure lust, but hold
        it as a secret, loth to reueale it.




CHAP. XXIIII.

_Cyclamen._   Sowebread.


The likenesse of the flowers, and the spotting of the leaues of the
_Dens Caninus_, with these of the _Cyclamen_ or Sowebread, maketh mee
ioyne it next thereunto: as also that after the bulbous rooted plants
I might begin with the tuberous that remaine, and make this plant the
beginning of them. Of this kinde there are diuers sorts, differing
both in forme of leaues and time of flowring: for some doe flower in
the Spring of the yeare, others afterwards in the beginning of Summer:
but the most number in the end of Summer, or beginning of Autumne or
Haruest, whereof some haue round leaues, others cornered like vnto
Iuie, longer or shorter, greater or smaller. Of them all in order, and
first of those that come in the Spring.


1. _Cyclamen Vernum flore purpureo._
Purple flowred Sowebread of the Spring.

This Sowebread hath a smaller roote then most of the others, yet round
and blackish on the outside, as all or most of the rest are (I speake
of them that I haue seene; for Clusius and others doe report to haue
had very great ones) from whence rise vp diuers round, yet pointed
leaues, and somewhat cornered withall, greene aboue, and spotted with
white spots circlewise about the leafe, and reddish vnderneath, which
at their first comming vp are folded together; among which come the
flowers, of a reddish purple colour and very sweete, euery one vpon
a small, long, and slender reddish foote-stalke, which hanging downe
their heads, turne vp their leaues againe: after the flowers are past,
the head or seede vessel shrinketh downe, winding his footestalke, and
coyling it selfe like a cable, which when it toucheth the ground, there
abideth hid among the leaues, till it be growne great and ripe, wherein
are contained a few small round seedes, which being presently sowne,
will growe first into round rootes, and afterwards from them shoote
forth leaues.


2. _Cyclamen Vernum flore albo._
White flowred Sowebread of the Spring.

The white flowring Sowebread hath his leaues like the former, but not
fully so much cornered, bearing small snow white flowers, as sweete as
the other: and herein consisteth the chiefest difference, in all other
things it is alike.


3. _Cyclamen Vernum Creticum flore albo._
White Candy Sowebread of the Spring.

This Sowebread is somewhat like the former white kinde, but that the
leaues grow much larger and longer, with more corners at the edges,
and more eminent spots on them: the flowers also somewhat longer and
larger, and herein consisteth the whole difference.


4. _Cyclamen Æstivum._   Summer Sowebread.

Summer Sowebread hath round leaues like vnto the Romane Sowebread,
but somewhat cornered, yet with shorter corners then the Iuie leafed
Sowebread, full of white spots on the vpperside of the leaues, and very
purple vnderneath, sometimes they haue fewer spots, and little or no
purple vnderneath: the flowers hereof are as small, as purple, and as
sweete, as the purple Sowebread of the Spring time: the roote hereof is
likewise small, blacke, and round.


5. _Cyclamen Romanum rotundifolium._
Romane Sowebread with round leaues.

The Romane Sowebread hath round leaues, somewhat like vnto the common
Sowebread, but not fully so round pointed at the ends, a little
cornered sometimes also, or as it were indented, with white spots round
about the middle of the leaues, and very conspicuous, which make it
seeme the more beautifull: the flowers appeare in Autumne, and are
shorter, and of a deeper purplish red colour then the Iuie Sowebread,
rising vp before the leaues for the most part, or at least with them,
and little or nothing sweete: the roote is round and blacke, vsually
not so flat as it, but growing sometimes to bee greater then any other
kinde of Sowebread. There is sometimes some variety to be seene, both

[Sidenote: _Varietas._]

in the leaues and flowers of this kinde; for that sometime the leaues
haue more corners, and either more or lesse spotted with white; the
flowers likewise of some are larger or lesser, longer or rounder,
paler or deeper coloured one then another. This happeneth most likely
from the sowing of the seede, causing the like variety as is seene in
the Iuie leafed Sowebread. It doth also many times happen from the
diuersity of soyles and countries where they grow: the seed of this, as
of all the rest, is small and round, contained in such like heads as
the former, standing almost like the head of a Snake that is twined or
folded within the body thereof. This and the other Autumnall kindes,
presently after their sowing in Autumne, shoote forth leaues, and so
abide all the Winter, according to their kinde.


6. _Cyclamen folio hederæ autumnale._   Iuie leafed Sowebread.

The Iuie leafed Sowebread groweth in the same manner that the former
doth, that is, bringeth forth flowers with the leaues sometimes, or
most commonly before them, whose flowers are greater then the common
round leafed Sowebread, somewhat longer then the former Romane or
Italian Sowebreads, and of a paler purple colour, almost bluish,
without that sweete sent as is in the first kinde of the Spring: the
greene leaues hereof are more long then round, pointed at the ends, and
hauing also one or two corners on each side, sometimes much spotted on
the vpperside with white spots and marks, and sometimes but a little or
not at all; and so likewise sometimes more or lesse purple vnderneath:
all the leaues and flowers doe stand vsually euery one seuerally by
themselues, vpon their owne slender foote-stalkes, as most of all the

[Sidenote: _Varietas._]

other kindes doe: but sometimes it happeneth, that both leaues and
flowers are found growing from one and the same stalke, which I rather
take to be accidentall, then naturall so to continue: the seede hereof
is like the former kindes, which being sowne produceth variety, both
in the forme of the leaues, and colour and smell of the flowers: some
being paler or deeper, and some more or lesse sweete then others: the
leaues also, some more or lesse cornered then others: the root groweth
to be great, being round and flat, and of a blackish browne colour on
the outside.


7. _Cyclamen autumnale hederæ folio flore albo._
Iuie leafed Sowebread with white flowers.

There is one of this kinde, whose leaues are rounder, and not so much
cornered as the former, flowring in Autumne as the last doth, and whose
flowers are wholly white, not hauing any other notable difference
therein.


8. _Cyclamen autumnale angustifolium._   Long leafed Sowebread.

This kinde of Sowebread may easily be knowne from all the other kindes,
because his leafe is longer and narrower then others, fashioned at the
bottome thereof with points, somewhat like vnto _Arum_ or Wake Robin
leaues: the flowers are like the former sorts for forme, but of a
purple colour. There is also another of this kinde in all things like
the former, but that the flowers are white.

]


9. _Cyclamen Antiochenum Autumnale flore purpureo duplici._
Double flowred Sowebread of Antioch.

This Sowebread of Antioch with double flowers, hath his leaues somewhat
round, like vnto the leaues of the Summer Sowebread, but with lesse
notches or corners, & full of white spots on them: it beareth flowers
on stalks, like vnto others, & likewise some stalks that haue two or
three flowers on them, which are very large, with ten or twelue
leaues a peece, of a faire Peach colour, like vnto the flowers of
purple Sowebread of the Spring, and deeper at the bottome.

There are of this kinde some, whose flowers appeare in the Spring, and
are as large and double as the former, but of a pure white colour.

There are of these Sowebreads of Antioch, that haue but single flowers,
some appearing in the Spring, and others in Autumne.


10. _Cyclamen vulgare folio rotundo._   The common Sowebread.

The common Sowebread (which is most vsed in the Apothecaries Shops)
hath many leaues spread vpon the ground, rising from certaine small
long heads, that are on the greater round rootes, as vsually most of
the former sorts doe, being in the like manner folded together, and
after spread themselues into round greene leaues, somewhat like vnto
the leaues of _Asarum_, but not shining, without any white spots on
the vpperside for the most part, or but very seldome, and reddish or
purplish vnderneath, and very seldome greener: the flowers stand vpon
small foot-stalkes, and shew themselues open for the most part, before
any leaues doe appeare, being smaller and shorter then those with Iuie
leaues, and of a pale purple colour, yet sometimes deeper, hanging
downe their heads, and turning vp their leaues againe, as all others
doe, but more sweete then many other of the Autumne flowers: after the
flowers are past, come the heads turning or winding themselues downe
in like manner as the other doe, hauing such like seede, but somewhat
larger, and more vneuen, or not so round at the least: the roote is
round, and not flat, of a browner colour, and not so blacke on the
outside as many of the others.


        The Place.

        The Sowebreads of the Spring doe both grow on the Pyrenæan
        Mountaines in Italy, and in Candy, and about Mompelier in
        France; Antioch in Syria also hath yeelded some both of the
        Spring and Autumne. Those with round and Iuie leaues grow in
        diuers places both of France and Italy: and the common in
        Germany, and the Lowe-Countries. But that Autumne Sowebread
        with white flowers, is reported to grow in the Kingdome of
        Naples. I haue very curiously enquired of many, if euer they
        found them in any parts of England, neare or further off from
        the places where they dwell: but they haue all affirmed, that
        they neuer found, or euer heard of any that haue found of any
        of them. This onely they haue assured, that there groweth none
        in the places, where some haue reported them to grow.


        The Time.

        Those of the Spring doe flower about the end of Aprill, or
        beginning of May. The other of the Summer, about the end of
        Iune or in Iuly. The rest some in August, and September, others
        in October.


        The Names.

        The Common Sowebread is called by most Writers in Latine,
        _Panis Porcinus_, and by that name it is knowne in the
        Apothecaries shops, as also by the name _Arthanita_, according
        to which name, they haue an ointment so called, which is to be
        made with the iuice hereof. It is also called by diuers other
        names, not pertinent for this discourse. The most vsuall name,
        whereby it is knowne to most Herbarists, is _Cyclamen_ (which
        is the Greeke word) or as some call it _Cyclaminus_ adding
        thereunto their other seuerall titles. In English, Sowebread.


        The Vertues.

        The leaues and rootes are very effectuall for the spleene, as
        the Ointment before remembred plainly proueth, being vsed for
        the same purpose, and that to good effect. It is vsed also
        for women in long and hard trauels, where there is danger,
        to accelerate the birth, either the roote or the leafe being
        applyed. But for any amorous effects, I hold it meere fabulous.




CHAP. XXV.

_Anemone._   Windeflower and his kindes.


The next tuberous rooted plants that are to follow (of right in my
opinion) are the _Anemones_ or Windeflowers, and although some tuberous
rooted plants, that is, the Asphodils, Spiderworts, and Flowerdeluces
haue beene before inserted, it was, both because they were in name
or forme of flowers sutable to them whom they were ioyned vnto, and
also that they should not be seuered and entreated of in two seuerall
places: the rest are now to follow, at the least so many of them as
be beautifull flowers, fit to furnish a Florists Garden, for natures
delightsome varieties and excellencies. To distinguish the Family of
_Anemones_ I may, that is, into the wilde kindes, and into the tame or
mannured, as they are called, and both of them noursed vp in Gardens;
and of them into those that haue broader leaues, and into those that
haue thinner or more iagged leaues: and of each of them, into those
that beare single flowers, and those that beare double flowers. But to
describe the infinite (as I may so say) variety of the colours of the
flowers, and to giue to each his true distinction and denomination,
_Hic labor, hoc opus est_, it farre passeth my ability I confesse, and
I thinke would grauell the best experienced this day in Europe (and
the like I said concerning Tulipas, it being as contingent to this
plant, as is before said of the Tulipa, to be without end in yeelding
varieties:) for who can see all the varieties that haue sprung from the
sowing of the seede in all places, seeing the variety of colours risen
from thence, is according to the variety of ayres & grounds wherein
they are sowne, skill also helping nature in ordering them aright. For
the seede of one and the same plant sowne in diuers ayres and grounds,
doe produce that variety of colours that is much differing one from
another; who then can display all the mixtures of colours in them, to
set them downe in so small a roome as this Book? Yet as I haue done
(in the former part of this Treatise) my good will, to expresse as
many of each kinde haue come to my knowledge, so if I endeauour the
like in this, I hope the courteous wil accept it, and hold me excused
for the rest: otherwise, if I were or could be absolute, I should take
from my self and others the hope of future augmentation, or addition
of any new, which neuer will be wanting. To begin therefore with the
wilde kinds (as they are so accounted) I shall first entreate of the
_Pulsatillas_ or Pasque flowers, which are certainly kindes of wilde
_Anemones_, both in leafe and flower, as may well be discerned by them
that are iudicious (although some learned men haue not so thought, as
appeareth by their writings) the rootes of them making one speciall
note of difference, from the other sorts of wilde _Anemones_.


1. _Pulsatilla Anglica purpurea._   The purple Pasque flower.

The Pasque or Passe flower which is of our owne Country, hath many
leaues lying on the ground, somewhat rough or hairie, hard in feeling,
and finely cut into many small leaues, of a darke greene colour, almost
like the leaues of Carrets, but finer and smaller, from among which
rise vp naked stalkes, rough or hairie also, set about the middle
thereof with some small diuided leaues compassing them, and rising
aboue these leaues about a spanne, bearing euery one of them one
pendulous flower, made of six leaues, of a fine Violet purple colour,
but somewhat deepe withall, in the middle whereof stand many yellow
threads, set about a middle purple pointell: after the flower is past,
there commeth vp in the stead thereof a bushie head of long seedes,
which are small and hoarie, hauing at the end of euery one a small
haire, which is gray likewise: the roote is small and long, growing
downewards into the ground, with a tuft of haire at the head thereof,
and not lying or running vnder the vpper crust thereof, as the other
wilde _Anemones_ doe.


2. _Pulsatilla Danica._   The Passe flower of Denmarke.

There is another that was brought out of Denmarke, very like vnto the
former, but that it is larger both in roote and leafe, and flower also,
which is of a fairer purple colour, not so deepe, and besides, will
better abide to bee mannured then our English kinde will, as my selfe
haue often proued.

[Sidenote: _Viriusque flore albo & flore duplici._]

Of both these sorts it is said, that some plants haue bin found, that
haue borne white flowers. And likewise one that bore double flowers,
that is, with two rowes of leaues.


3. _Pulsatilla flore rubro._   The red Passe flower.

Lobel, as I take it, did first set forth this kinde, being brought him
from Syria, the leaues whereof are finer cut, the flower smaller, and
with longer leaues, and of a red colour.


4. _Pulsatilla flore luteo._   The yellow Passe flower.

The yellow Passe flower hath his leaues cut and diuided, very like vnto
the leaues of the first kinde, but somewhat more hairie, greene on
the vpperside, and hairie vnderneath: the stalke is round and hoary,
the middle whereof is beset with some small leaues, as in the other,
from among which riseth vp the stalke of the flower, consisting of six
leaues of a very faire yellow colour on the inside, and of a hoary pale
yellow on the outside; after which followeth such an head of hairie
thrummes as in the former: the roote is of the bignesse of a mans
finger.


5. _Pulsatilla flore albo._   The white Passe flower.

The white Passe flower (which Clusius maketh a kinde of _Anemone_, and
yet as hee saith himselfe, doth more nearely resemble the _Pulsatilla_)
hath, from amongst a tuft or head of haires, which grow at the toppe
of a long blacke roote, many leaues standing vpon long stalkes, which
are diuided as it were into three wings or parts, and each part finely
cut and diuided, like vnto the Passe flower of Denmarke, but somewhat
harder in handling, greenish on the vpperside, and somewhat gray
vnderneath, and very hairie all ouer: among these leaues rise vp the
stalkes, beset at the middle of them with three leaues, as finely cut
and diuided as those belowe, from aboue which standeth the flower,
being smaller, and not so pendulous as the former, but in the like
manner consisting of six leaues, of a snow white colour on the inside,
and a little browner on the outside, with many yellow thrums in the
middle: after the flower is past, riseth vp such a like hoary head,
composed as it were of many haires, each whereof hath a small seede
fastened vnto it, like as the former Passe flowers haue.


        The Place.

        The first is found in many places of England, vpon dry bankes
        that lye open to the Sunne.

        The second was first brought, as I take it, by Doctor Lobel
        from Denmarke, & is one of the two kinds, that Clusius saith
        are common in Germanie, this bearing a paler purple flower, and
        more early then the other, which is the same with our English,
        whose flower is so darke, that it almost seemeth blacke.

        The red kinde, as Lobel saith, came from Syria.

        The yellow Passe flower, which Clusius maketh his third wilde
        _Anemone_, was found very plentifully growing at the foote of
        St. Bernards Hill, neare vnto the Cantons of the Switzers.

        The white one groweth on the Alpes neare Austria, in France
        likewise and other places.

]


        The Time.

        All of them doe flower early in the yeare, that is, in the
        beginning of Aprill, about which time most commonly Easter doth
        fall.


        The Names.

        Their proper names are giuen to each in their seuerall titles,
        being all of them kindes of wilde _Anemones_, as I said in the
        beginning of the Chapter, and so for the most part all Authors
        doe acknowledge them. We call them in English, because they
        flower about Easter, Pasque flower, which is the French name
        for Easter, or _Euphoniæ gratia_, Pasque flower, which may
        passe currant, without any further descant on the name, or else
        _Pulsatilla_, if you will, being growne old by custome.


        The Vertues.

        The sharpe biting and exulcerating quality of this plant,
        causeth it to be of little vse, notwithstanding Ioachimus
        Camerarius saith in his _Hortus Medicus_, that in Borussia,
        which is a place in Italy, as I take it, the distilled water
        hereof is vsed with good successe, to be giuen to them that
        are troubled with a Tertian Ague; for he saith that it is
        _medicamentum_ ὀκφρακτικὸν, that is, a medicine of force to
        helpe obstructions.


_Anemone siluestris latifolia alba siue tertia Matthioli._
The white wilde broad leafed Windflower.

This Windflower hath diuers broad greene leaues, cut into diuisions,
and dented, about, very like vnto a broad leafed Crowfoote, among which
riseth vp a stalke, hauing some such like cut leaues in the middle
thereof, as growe below, but smaller; on the toppe whereof standeth one
large white flower, consisting of fiue leaues for the most part, with
some yellow threads in the middle, standing about such a greene head
as is in the tame or garden _Anemones_, which growing greater after
the flower is past, is composed of many small seedes, wrapped in white
wooll, which as soone as they are ripe, raise themselues vp from the
bottome of the head, and flye away with the winde, as the other tame
or garden kindes doe: the roote is made of a number of long blacke
strings, encreasing very much by running vnder ground, and shooting vp
in diuers places.


_Anemone siluestris tenuifolia lutea._
The yellow wilde thin leafed Windflower.

The yellow wilde _Anemone_ riseth vp with one or two small round
naked stalkes, bearing about the middle of them, small, soft, and
tender iagged leaues, deeply cut in and indented on the edges about,
from aboue which, doth grow the stalke, bearing small yellow flowers,
standing vpon weake foote-stalks, like vnto a small Crowfoot, with some
threads in the middle: the roote is long and small, somewhat like vnto
the roote of Pollipodie, creeping vnder the vpper crust of the earth:
this kinde is lower, and springeth somewhat earlier then the other
wilde kindes that follow.


_Anemone siluestris tenuifolia alba simplex._
The single white thin leafed wilde Windflower.

This white wilde _Anemone_ riseth vp with diuers leaues vpon seuerall
long stalkes; which are somewhat like vnto the former, but that they
are somewhat harder, and not so long, nor the diuisions of the leaues
so finely snipt about the edges, but a little broader, and deeper cut
in on euery side: the flowers hereof are larger and broader then the
former, white on the inside, and a little purplish on the outside,
especially at the bottome of the flower next vnto the stalke: the
roote of this is very like vnto the last.

[Sidenote: _Purpurea._]

There is another of this kinde, whose flowers are purple, in all other
things it is like vnto the white.

[Sidenote: _Coccinea siue suave rubens._]

And likewise another, with a blush or carnation coloured flower.

[Sidenote: _Peregrina alba._]

There is one that is onely nursed vp with vs in Gardens, that is
somewhat like vnto these former wilde _Anemones_ in roote and leafe,
but that the flower of this, being pure white within, and a little
purplish without, consisting of eight or nine small round pointed
leaues, hath sometimes some leaues vnder the flower, party coloured
white and greene: the flower hath likewise a greene head, like a
Strawberry, compassed about with white threads, tipt with yellow
pendents.

[Sidenote: _Peregrina viridis._]

And another of the same kinde with the last, whose flower consisting
of eight or nine leaues, is of a greenish colour, except the foure
outermost leaues, which are a little purplish, and diuided at the
points into three parts; the middle part is of a greenish white colour,
with a greene head in the middle as the other.


_Anemone siluestris trifolia Dodonæi._
The three leafed wilde Windflower.

This wilde _Anemone_ hath his rootes very like vnto the former kindes;
the leaues are alwaies three set together at the toppe of slender
stalkes, being small and indented about, very like vnto a three leafed
Grasse, but smaller: the flower consisteth of eight small leaues,
somewhat like vnto a Crowfoote, but of a whitish purple or blush
colour, with some white threads, and a greene rough head in the middle.


_Anemone siluestris flore pleno albo._
The double white wilde Windflower.

This double kinde is very like vnto the single white kinde before
described, both in his long running rootes, and thin leaues, but
somewhat larger: the flowers hereof are very thicke and double,
although they be small, and of a faint sweete sent, very white after
it is full blowne for fiue or six dayes, but afterwards it becommeth
a little purplish on the inside, but more on the outside: this neuer
giueth seede (although it haue a small head in the middle) like as many
other double flowers doe.


_Anemone siluestris flore pleno purpureo._
The double purple wilde Windflower.

This double purple kinde hath such like iagged leaues as the last
described hath, but more hoarie vnderneath: the flower is of a fine
light purple toward the points of the leaues, the bottomes being of a
deeper purple, but as thicke, and full of leaues as the former, with a
greene head in the middle, like vnto the former: this kinde hath small
greene leaues on the stalkes vnder the flowers, cut and diuided like
the lower leaues.


        The Place.

        The first broad leafed _Anemone_ groweth in diuers places of
        Austria and Hungary. The yellow in diuers woods in Germany,
        but not in this Countrey that euer I could learne. The other
        single wilde kindes, some of them are very frequent throughout
        the most places of England, in Woods, Groues, and Orchards.
        The double kindes were found, as Clusius saith, in the
        Lowe-Countries, in a Wood neare Louaine.


        The Time.

        They flower from the end of March (that is the earliest) and
        the beginning of Aprill, vntill May, and the double kindes
        begin within a while after the single kinds are past.


        The Names.

        They are called _Ranunculi siluarum_, and _Ranunculi nemorum_,
        and as Clusius would haue them, _Leimonia_ of Theophrastus;
        they are generally called of most Herbarists _Anemones
        siluestres_, Wilde _Anemones_ or Windflowers. The Italians
        call them _Gengeuo saluatico_, that is, Wilde Ginger, because
        the rootes are, besides the forme, being somewhat like small
        Ginger, of a biting hot and sharpe taste.


_Anemone Lusitanica siue hortensis latifolia flore simplici luteo._
The single Garden yellow Windflower or Anemone.

This single yellow Anemone or Windflower hath diuers broad round
leaues, somewhat diuided and endented withall on the edges, brownish at
the first rising vp out of the ground, and almost folded together, and
after of a sad greene on the vpperside, and reddish vnderneath; among
which rise vp small slender stalkes, beset at the middle of them with
two or three leaues, more cut and diuided then those belowe, with small
yellow flowers at the toppe of them, consisting of ten or twelue leaues
a peece, hauing a few yellow threads in the middle of them, standing
about a small greene head, which in time growing ripe hath small flat
seede, inclosed within a soft wooll or downe, which is easily blowne
away with the winde: the roote groweth downeward into the ground,
diuersly spread with branches here and there, of a brownish yellow on
the outside, and whitish within, so brittle, that it can hardly bee
touched without breaking.


_Anemone latifolia flore luteo duplici._
The double yellow Anemone or Windflower.

This double yellow Anemone hath such broad round leaues as the single
kinde hath, but somewhat larger or ranker: the stalkes are beset with
larger leaues, more deeply cut in on the edges: the flowers are of
a more pale yellow, with some purplish veines on the outside, and a
little round pointed; but they are all on the inside of a faire yellow
colour, consisting of two rowes of leaues, whereof the innermost is the
narrower, with a small greene head in the middle, compassed with yellow
threads as in the former: the roote is like the roote of the single;
neither of these haue any good sent, and this springeth vp and flowreth
later then the single kinde.


_Anemone latifolia purpurea stellata siue papaveracea._
The purple Starre Anemone or Windflower.

The first leaues of this purple Anemone, which alwayes spring vp before
Winter, (if the roote be not kept too long out of the ground,) are
somewhat like the leaues of _Sanicle_ or Selfe-heale, but the rest
that follow are more deeply cut in and iagged; among which rise vp
diuers round stalkes, beset with iagged leaues as all other Anemones
are, aboue which leaues, the stalkes rising two or three inches high,
beare one flower a peece, composed of twelue leaues or more, narrow and
pointed, of a bleake purple or whitish ash-colour, somewhat shining on
the outside, and of a fine purple colour tending to a murrey on the
inside, with many blackish blew threads or thrummes in the middle of
the flower, set about a head, whereon groweth the seede, which is small
and blacke, inclosed in soft wooll or downe, which flieth away with the
winde, carrying the seede with it, if it be not carefully gathered: the
roote is blackish on the outside, and white within, tuberous or knobby,
with many fibres growing at it.


_Anemone purpurea Stellata altera._   Another purple Starre Anemone.

There is so great diuersity in the colours of the flowers of these
broad leafed kinds of Anemones or Windflowers, that they can very
hardly be expressed, although in their leaues there is but little or no
difference. I shall not neede therefore to make seuerall descriptions
of euery one that shall be set downe; but it will be sufficient, I
thinke, to giue you the distinctions of the flowers: for as I said,
therein is the greatest and chiefest difference. This other Starre
Anemone differeth not from the former in leafe or flower, but onely
that this is of a more pale sullen colour on the outside, and of a
paler purple colour on the inside.

]


_Viola purpurea._

        There is another, whose flower hath eight leaues, as many of
        them that follow haue (although diuers sorts haue but six
        leaues in a flower) and is of a Violet purple, and therefore is
        called, The Violet purple Anemone.

_Varietas._

        Of all these three sorts last described, there be other that
        differ only in hauing white bottomes, some smaller and some
        larger.

_Purpurea striata._

        There is also another of the same Violet purple colour with the
        former, but a little paler, tending more to rednesse, whose
        flowers haue many white lines and stripes through the leaues,
        and is called, The purple stript Anemone.

_Carnea vivacissima simplex._

        There is another, whose greene leaues are somewhat larger, and
        so is the flower likewise, consisting of eight leaues, and
        sometimes of more, of the colour of Carnation silke, sometimes
        pale and sometimes deeper, with a whitish circle about the
        bottome of the leaues, which circle in some is larger, and more
        to be seene then in others, when the flower layeth it selfe
        open with the heate of the Sunne, hauing blewish threads in the
        middle. This may be called, the Carnation Anemone.

_Persiciviolacea._

        We haue another, whose flower is betweene a Peach colour and a
        Violet, which is vsually called a Gredeline colour.

_Cochenille._

        And another of a fine reddish Violet or purple, which we call,
        The Cochenille Anemone.

_Cardinalis._

        And another of a rich crimson red colour, and may be called,
        The Cardinall Anemone.

_Sanguinea._

        Another of a deeper, but not so liuely a red, called, The bloud
        red Anemone.

_Cramesina._

        Another of an ordinary crimson colour, called, The crimson
        Anemone.

_Coccinea._

        Another of a Stamell colour, neare vnto a Scarlet.

_Incarnata._

        Another of a fine delayed red or flesh colour, and may bee
        called, The Incarnidine Anemone.

_Incarnata Hispanica._

        Another whose flower is of a liuely flesh colour, shadowed with
        yellow, and may be called, The Spanish Incarnate Anemone.

_Rubescens._

        Another of a faire whitish red, which we call, The Blush
        Anemone.


_Moschutella._

        Another whose flower consisteth of eight leaues, of a darke
        whitish colour, stript all ouer with veines of a fine blush
        colour, the bottomes being white, this may be called, The
        Nutmegge Anemone.

_Enfumata._

        Another whose flower is of a pale whitish colour, tending to a
        gray, such as the Monkes and Friers were wont to weare with vs,
        and is called, A Monkes gray.

_Pauo maior simplici flore._

        There is another, whose leafe is somewhat broader then many or
        most of the Anemones, comming neare vnto the leafe of the great
        double Orenge coloured Anemone; the flower whereof is single,
        consisting of eight large or broad leaues, very neare vnto the
        same Orenge colour, that is in the double flower hereafter
        described, but somewhat deeper. This is vsually called in
        Latine, _Pauo maior simplici flore_, and we in English, The
        great single Orenge tawnie Anemone.

_Pauo minor._

        There is likewise of this kinde another, whose flower is
        lesser, and called, The lesser Orenge tawnie Anemone.

_Varietas magna ex seminio._

        There is besides these expressed, so great a variety of mixt
        colours in the flowers of this kinde of Anemone with broad
        leaues, arising euery yeare from the sowing of the seede of
        some of the choisest and fittest for that purpose, that it is
        wonderfull to obserue, not onely the variety of single colours,
        but the mixture of two or three colours in one flower, besides
        the diuersity of the bottomes of the flowers, some hauing white
        or yellowish bottomes, and some none, and yet both of the same
        colour; and likewise in the thrums or threads in the middle:
        But the greatest wonder of beauty is in variety of double
        flowers, that arise from among the other single ones, some
        hauing two or three rowes of leaues in the flowers, and some so
        thicke of leaues as a double Marigold, or double Crowfoote, and
        of the same seuerall colours that are in the single flowers,
        that it is almost impossible to expresse them seuerally, and
        (as is said before) some falling out to bee double in one
        yeare, which will proue single or lesse double in another,
        yet very many abiding constant double as at the first; and
        therefore let this briefe recitall be sufficient in stead of a
        particular of all the colours.


_Anemone Chalcedonica maxima versicolor._
The great double Windflower of Constantinople.

This great Anemone of Constantinople hath broader and greener leaues
then any of the former kindes, and not so much diuided or cut in at
the edges, among which rise vp one or two stalkes, (seldome more from
one roote) hauing some leaues about the middle of the stalke, as other
Anemones haue, and bearing at the toppes of the stalkes one large
flower a peece, very double, whose outermost leaues being broadest,
are greenish at the first, but afterwards red, hauing sometimes some
greene abiding still in the leaues, and the red striped through it: the
other leaues which are within these are smaller, and of a perfect red
colour; the innermost being smallest, are of the same red colour but
turned somewhat inward, hauing no thrummes or threads in the middle,
as the former haue, and bearing no seede: the roote is blackish on the
outside, and white within, thicke and tuberous as the other kindes, but
thicker set and close together, not shooting any long slender rootes as
others doe. Some Gentlewomen call this Anemone, The Spanish Marigold.


_Anemone Chalcedonica altera siue Pauo maior flore duplici._
The great double Orenge tawney Anemone.

This other great Anemone of Constantinople hath his large leaues so
like vnto the last, that one can hardly distinguish them asunder; the
stalke hath also such like leaues set vpon it, bearing at the toppe a
faire large flower, consisting of many leaues set in two or three rowes
at the most, but not so thicke or double as the last, yet seeming to
be but one thicke rowe of many small and long leaues, of an excellent
red or crimson colour, wherein some yellow is mixed, which maketh that
colour is called an Orenge tawney; the bottomes of the leaues are red,
compassed with a whitish circle, the thrummie head in the middle being
beset with many darke blackish threads: the roote is like the former.


_Anemone Superitica siue Cyparissia._   The double Anemone of Cyprus.

This Anemone (which the Dutchmen call Superitz, and as I haue beene
enformed, came from the Isle of Cyprus) hath leaues very like the last
double Anemone, but not altogether so large: the flower consisteth
of smaller leaues, of colour very neare vnto the last double Orenge
coloured Anemone, but more thicke of leaues, and as double as the
first, although not so great a flower, without any head in the middle,
or thrums about it as is in the last, and differeth not in the roote
from either of them both.

Somewhat like vnto this kinde, or as it were betweene this and the
first kinde of these great double Anemones, we haue diuers other sorts,
bearing flowers very thicke and double; some of them being white,
or whitish, or purple, deepe or paler, and some of a reddish colour
tending to Scarlet or a Carnation colour, and some also of a blush
or flesh colour, and diuers other colours, and all of them continue
constant in their colours.


_Anemone Cacumeni Maringi siue Persica._   The double Persian Anemone.

This rare Anemone, which is said to come out of Persia to
Constantinople, and from thence to vs, is in leafe and roote very like
vnto the former double Anemones before described; onely the flower
hereof is rather like vnto the second great double Orenge coloured
Anemone, vsually called _Pauo maior flore pleno_, being composed of
three rowes of leaues, the outermost rowe consisting of ten or twelue
larger leaues, and those more inward lesser and more in number, but all
of them variably mixed with white, red, and yellow, having the bottomes
of the leaues white: but instead of a middle head with thrums about it,
as the other hath, this hath a few narrow leaues, or a deepe yellow
colour in the middle of the flower, standing vpright.

Hauing thus farre proceeded in the two parts of the kindes of Anemones
or Windflowers, it remaineth to entreate of the rest, which is those
Anemones which haue thin cut leaues, whereof some haue reckoned vp
thirty sorts with single flowers, which I confesse I haue not seene;
but so many as haue come to my knowledge, I shall here set downe.


_Anemone tenuifolia siue Geranifolia cærulea._
The Watchet Anemone or Storkes bill leafed Windflower.

This first Windflower with thin cut leaues, riseth not out of the
ground vntil the great Winter frosts be past, that is, about the middle
or end of February, and are somewhat brownish at their first appearing,
but afterwards spread into wings of greene leaues, somewhat broader
then the rest that follow, diuided into three parts, & each part into
three leaues, euery one cut in about the edges, one standing against
another vpon a long slender foote-stalke, and the end leafe by it
selfe: among these riseth vp two or three greene stalkes, garnished
with such like thin leaues as are at the bottome, from aboue which rise
the flowers, but one vpon a stalke, consisting of fourteene or fifteene
small pale blew or watchet leaues, lesser then any of the single kindes
that follow, compassing many whitish threads, and a small greene head
in the middle, somewhat like the head of the wilde Crowfoote, wherein
is contained such like seede: the roote is blackish without, thrusting
out into long tuberous peeces, somewhat like vnto some of the broad
leafed Anemones.

[Sidenote: _Alba._]

Of this kinde there is another, whose leaues are not browne at their
first rising, but greene, and the flowers are white, in other things
not differing.


_Anemone tenuifolia purpurea vulgaris._
The ordinary purple Anemone with thin leaues.

This purple Anemone which is most common, and therefore the lesse
regarded, hath many winged leaues standing vpon seuerall stalkes, cut
and diuided into diuers leaues, much like vnto the leaues of a Carrot;
among which rise vp stalkes with some leaues thereon (as is vsuall
to the whole Family of Anemones, both wilde and tame, as is before
said;) at the toppes whereof stand the flowers, made of six leaues
most vsually, but sometimes they will haue seuen or eight, being very
large, and of a perfect purple Violet colour, very faire and liuely:
the middle head hath many blackish thrums or threads about it, which I
could neuer obserue in my Gardens to beare seed: the roote is smaller,
and more spreading euery way into small long flat tuberous parts, then
any other kindes of single or double Anemones.

_Carneapallida._

        There is another very like in leafe and roote vnto the former,
        but the flower is nothing so large, and is whitish, tending to
        a blush colour, and of a deeper blush colour toward the bottome
        of the flower, with blackish blew thrums in the middle, and
        giueth no seede that I could euer obserue.

_Carnea viuida vnguibus albis._

        There is likewise another like vnto the last in leafe and
        flower, but that the flower is larger then it, and is a of
        liuely blush colour, the leaues hauing white bottomes.

_Alba venis purpureis._

        And another, whose flower is white, with purple coloured veines
        and stripes through euery leafe, and is a lesser flower then
        the other.


_Anemone tenuifolia coccinea simplex._
The single Scarlet Anemone with thin leaues.

The leaues of this Scarlet Windflower are somewhat like vnto the
former, but a little broader, and not so finely cut and diuided: the
flower consisteth of six reasonable large leaues, of an excellent
red colour, which we call a Scarlet; the bottomes of the leaues are
large and white, and the thrums or threads in the middle of a blackish
purple colour: the roote is tuberous, but consisting of thicker peeces,
somewhat like vnto the rootes of the broad leafed Anemones, but
somewhat browne and not so blacke, and most like vnto the roote of the
double Scarlet Anemone.

_Coccinea absq; vnguibus._

        There is another of this kinde, whose flower is neare vnto the
        same colour, but this hath no white bottomes at all in his
        leaues.

_Flore holosericeo._

        We haue another which hath as large a flower as any single, and
        is of an Orient deepe red crimson Veluet colour.

        _Sanguinea._

        There is another of a deeper red colour, and is called, The
        bloud red single Anemone.

        _Rubra fundo luteo._

        And another, whose flower is red with the bottome yellow.

        _Coccinea dilutior._

        Another of a perfect crimson colour, whereof some haue round
        pointed leaues, and others sharpe pointed, and some a little
        lighter or deeper then others.

        _Alba staminibus purpureis._

        There is also one, whose flower is pure white with blewish
        purple thrums in the middle.

        _Carnea Hispanica._

        And another, whose flower is very great, of a kinde of sullen
        blush colour, but yet pleasant, with blewish threads in the
        middle.

        _Alba carneis venis._

        And another with blush veines in euery leafe of the white
        flower.

        _Alba purpureis vnguibus._

        And another, the flower whereof is white, the bottomes of the
        leaues being purple.

        _Purpurascens._

        Another whose flower consisteth of many small narrow leaues,
        of a pale purple or blush colour on the outside, and somewhat
        deeper within.

_Facie florum pomi simplex._

        There is another like in leafe and roote vnto the first Scarlet
        Anemone, but the flower hereof consisteth of seuen large leaues
        without any bottomes, of a white colour, hauing edges, and some
        large stripes also of a carnation or flesh colour to bee seene
        in them, marked somewhat like an Apple blossome, and thereupon
        it is called in Latine, _Anemone tenuifolia simplex alba
        instar florum pomi_, or _facie florum pomi_, that is to say in
        English, The single thin leafed Anemone with Apple blossome
        flowers.

_Multiplex._

        I haue heard that there is one of this kinde with double
        flowers.


1. _Anemone tenuifolia flore coccineo pleno vulgaris._
The common double red or Scarlet Anemone.

The leaues of this double Anemone are very like vnto the leaues of the
single Scarlet Anemone, but not so thin cut and diuided as that with
the purple flower: the flower hereof when it first openeth it selfe,
consisteth of six and sometimes of seuen or eight broad leaues, of a
deepe red, or excellent Scarlet colour, the middle head being thick
closed, and of a greenish colour, which after the flower hath stood
blowne some time, doth gather colour, and openeth it selfe into many
small leaues, very thicke, of a more pale red colour, and more Stamell
like then the outer leaues: the root of this is thicke and tuberous,
very like vnto the root of the single Scarlet Anemone.


2. _Anemone tenuifolia flore coccineo pleno variegata._
The party coloured double Crimson Anemone.

We haue a kinde hereof, varying neither in roote, leafe, or forme of
flower from the former, but in the colour, in that this will haue
sometimes the outer broad leaues party coloured, with whitish or blush
coloured great streakes in the red leaues both inside and outside; as
also diuers of the middle or inner leaues striped in the same manner:
the roote hereof giueth fairer flowers in some yeares then in others,
and sometimes giue flowers all red againe.


3. _Anemone tenuifolia flore coccineo saturo pleno._
The double crimson Veluet Anemone.

Wee haue another also, whose flower is of a deepe Orenge tawny crimson
colour, neare vnto the colour of the outer leaues, of the lesser French
Marigold, and not differing from the former in any thing else.


4. _Anemone tenuifolia flore pleno suauerubente._
The greater double blush Anemone.

There is small difference to be discerned, either in the roote or
leaues of this from the former double Scarlet Anemone, sauing that
the leaues hereof are a little broader, and seeme to bee of a little
fresher greene colour: the flower of this is as large almost, and as
double as the former, and the inner leaues likewise almost as large as
they, being of a whitish or flesh colour at the first opening of them,
but afterwards become of a most liuely blush colour; the bottomes of
the leaues abiding of a deeper blush, and with long standing, the tops
of the leaues will turne almost wholly white againe.


5. _Anemone tenuifolia flore albo pleno._   The double white Anemone.

This double white Anemone differeth little from the former blush
Anemone, but in that it is smaller in all the parts thereof, and also
that the flower hereof being wholly of a pure white colour, without
any shew of blush therein, hath the middle thrummes much smaller and
shorter then it, and not rising vp so high, but seeme as if they were
chipped off euen at the toppes.


6. _Anemone tenuifolia flore pleno albicante._
The lesser double blush Anemone.

This small double blush Anemone differeth very little from the double
white last recited, but onely in the colour of the flower: for they are
both much about the bignesse one of another, the middle thrums likewise
being as small and short, and as euen aboue, onely the flower at the
first opening is almost white, but afterwards the outer leaues haue a
more shew of blush in them, and the middle part a little deeper then
they.


7. _Anemone tenuifolia flore pleno purpureo violaceo._
The double purple Anemone.

This double purple Anemone is also of the same kindred with the first
double red or Scarlet Anemone for the form or doublenesse of the
flower, consisting but of six or seuen leaues at the most in this our
Country, although in the hotter it hath ten or twelue, or more as large
leaues for the outer border, and as large small leaues for the inner
middle also, and almost as double, but of a deepe purple tending toward
a Violet colour, the outer leaues being not so deepe as the inner: the
roote and leafe commeth neare vnto the single purple Anemone before
described, but that the roote spreadeth not so small and so much.


8. _Anemone tenuifolia flore pleno purpureo cæruleo._
The double blew Anemone.

This Anemone differeth not in any thing from the former double purple,
but onely that the flower is paler, and more tending to a blew colour.


9. _Anemone tenuifolia flore pleno roseo._
The double Rose coloured Anemone.

The double Rose coloured Anemone differeth also in nothing from the
former double purple, but onely in the flower, which is somewhat
smaller, and not so thicke and double, and that it is of a reddish
colour, neare vnto the colour of a pale red Rose, or of a deepe
coloured Damaske.


10. _Anemone tenuifolia flore pleno carneo viuacissimo._
The double Carnation Anemone.

This Anemone, both in roote, leafe, and flower, commeth nearest vnto
the former double white Anemone, for the largenesse and doublenesse of
the flower, and in the smalnesse of the middle thrums, and euennesse at
the toppes of them, being not so large and great a flower as the double
purple, either in the inner or outer leaues, but yet is very faire,
thicke and double, and of a most liuely Carnation silke colour, very
deepe, both the outer leaues and middle thrums also so bright, that it
doth as it were amaze, and yet delight the minde of the beholder, but
by long standing in the Sun, waxe a little paler, and so passe away as
all the most beautifull flowers doe.

        Carnation silke colour.
]


11. _Anemone tenuifolia flore rubrofusco pleno coma Amarantina._
The double purple Veluet Anemone.

This double Veluet Anemone is in all things like the last described
Carnation Anemone, but somewhat larger, the difference consisteth in
the colour of the flower, which in this is of a deep or sad crimson
red colour for the outer leaues and of a deep purple Veluet colour in
the middle thrums, resembling the colour of the lesser _Amaranthus
purpureus_, or Purple flower gentle hereafter described, whereof it
tooke the name, which middle thrums are as fine and small, and as euen
at the toppes as the white or last Carnation Anemones.


12. _Anemone tenuifolia flore pleno tricolor._
The double purple Veluet Anemone of three colours.

This double Anemone also is very like the last described Anemone, but
that in the middle of the purple thrums, there thrusteth forth a tuft
of threads or leaues of a more light crimson colour.

And thus much for the kindes of Anemones or Windflowers, so farre forth
as haue hitherto come to our knowledge; yet I doubt not, but that more
varieties haue beene elsewhere collected, and will be also in our
Countrey daily and yearly obserued by diuers, that raise them vp from
sowing the seede, wherein lyeth a pretty art, not yet familiarly knowne
to our Nation, although it be very frequent in the Lowe-Countries,
where their industry hath bred and nourished vp such diuersities and
varieties, that they haue valued some Anemones at such high rates,
as most would wonder at, and none of our Nation would purchase, as I
thinke. And I doubt not, if wee would be as curious as they, but that
both our ayre and soyle would produce as great variety, as euer hath
been seene in the Lowe-Countries; which to procure, if any of our
Nation will take so much paines in sowing the seedes of Anemones, as
diuers haue done of Tulipas: I will set them downe the best directions
for that purpose that I haue learned, or could by much search and
tryall attaine vnto; yet I must let them vnderstand thus much also,
that there is not so great variety of double flowers raised from the
seede of the thin leafed Anemones, as from the broad leafed ones.

First therefore (as I said before) concerning Tulipas, there is some
speciall choice to be made of such flowers, whose seed is fittest to be
taken. Of the _Latifolias_, the double Orenge tawney seede being sowne,
yeeldeth pretty varieties, but the purples, and reds, or crimsons,
either _Latifolias_ or _Tenuifolias_, yeeld small variety, but such as
draw nearest to their originall, although some be a little deeper or
lighter then others. But the light colours be they which are the chiefe
for choice, as white, ash-colour, blush or carnation, light orenge,
simple or party coloured, single or double, if they beare seede, which
must bee carefully gathered, and that not before it bee thorough
ripe, which you shall know by the head; for when the seede with the
wollinesse beginneth to rise a little of it selfe at the lower end, it
must bee then quickly gathered, lest the winde carry it all away. After
it is thus carefully gathered, it must be laid to dry for a weeke or
more, which then being gently rubbed with a little dry sand or earth,
will cause the seede to be somewhat better separated, although not
thoroughly from the woollinesse or downe that compasseth it.

Within a moneth at the most after the seede is thus gathered and
prepared, it must be sowne; for by that meanes you shall gaine a yeare
in the growing, ouer that you should doe if you sowed it in the next
Spring.

If there remaine any woollinesse in the seede, pull it in sunder as
well as you can, and then sowe your seede reasonable thin, and not too
thicke, vpon a plaine smooth bed of fine earth, or rather in pots or
tubbes, and after the sowing, sift or gently straw ouer them some fine
good fresh mould, about one fingers thicknesse at the most for the
first time: And about a moneth after their first springing vp, sift
or straw ouer them in like manner another fingers thicknesse of fine
earth, and in the meane time if the weather proue dry, you must water
them gently and often, but not to ouerglut them with moisture; and thus
doing, you shall haue them spring vp before Winter, and grow pretty
strong, able to abide the sharpe Winter in their nonage, in vsing some
little care to couer them loosely with some fearne, or furse, or beane
hame, or straw, or any such, which yet must not lye close vpon them,
nor too farre from them neither.

The next Spring after the sowing, if you will, but it is better if you
stay vntill August, you may then remoue them, and set them in order by
rowes, with sufficient distance one from another, where they may abide,
vntill you see what manner of flower each plant will beare, which you
may dispose of according to your minde.

Many of them being thus ordered (if your mould be fine, loose, and
fresh, not stonie, clayish, or from a middin) will beare flowers the
second yeare after the sowing, and most or all of them the third yeare,
if the place where you sowe them, be not annoyed with the smoake of
Brewers, Dyers, or Maultkils, which if it be, then will they neuer
thriue well.

Thus much haue I thought good to set downe, to incite some of our owne
Nation to be industrious; and to helpe them forward, haue giuen such
rules of directions, that I doubt not, but they will vpon the tryall
and view of the variety, proceede as well in the sowing of Anemones as
of Tulipas.

I cannot (Gentlewomen) withold one other secret from you, which is
to informe you how you may so order Anemones, that after all others
ordinarily are past, you may haue them in flower for two or three
moneths longer then are to be seene with any other, that vseth not this
course I direct you.

The ordinary time to plant Anemones, is most commonly in August, which
will beare flower some peraduenture before Winter, but most vsually in
February, March, and Aprill, few or none of them abiding vntill May;
but it you will keepe some roots out of the ground vnplanted, vntill
February, March, and Aprill, and plant some at one time, and some at
another, you shall haue them beare flower according to their planting,
those that shall be planted in February, will flower about the middle
or end of May, and so the rest accordingly after that manner: And
thus may you haue the pleasure of these plants out of their naturall
seasons, which is not permitted to be enioyed in any other that I know,
Nature being not so prone to bee furthered by art in other things as in
this. Yet regard, that in keeping your Anemone rootes out of the ground
for this purpose, you neither keep them too dry, nor yet too moist, for
sprouting or rotting; and in planting them, that you set them not in
too open a sunny place, but where they may be somewhat shadowed.


        The Place.

        I shall not need to spend much time in relating the seuerall
        places of these Anemones, but onely to declare that the
        most of them that haue not beene raised from seed, haue
        come from Constantinople to vs; yet the first broad leafed
        or yellow Anemone, was first found in Portugall, and from
        thence brought into these parts. And the first purple Starre
        Anemone in Germanie, yet was the same sent among others from
        Constantinople also. And the first thin cut leafed Anemone
        came first out of Italy, although many of that sort haue come
        likewise from Constantinople. And so haue the double red or
        Scarlet Anemones, and the great double blush, which I first
        had by the gift of Mʳ. Humfrey Packington of Worcestershire
        Esquire, at Haruington.


        The Time.

        The times of their flowring are sufficiently expressed in the
        descriptions, or in the rules for planting.


        The Names.

        The Turkish names whereby the great double broad leafed kindes
        haue beene sent vnto vs, were _Giul Catamer_, and _Giul Catamer
        lale_; And _Binizade_, _Binizante_, and _Galipoli lale_ for
        the thinne cut leafed Anemones. All Authors haue called them
        _Anemones_, and are the true _Herbæ venti_. Wee call them in
        English eyther Anemones, after the Greeke name, or Windflowers,
        after the Latine.


        The Vertues.

        There is little vse of these in Physicke in our dayes, eyther
        for inward or outward diseases; onely the leaues are vsed in
        the Ointment called _Marciatum_, which is composed of many
        other hot herbes, and is vsed in cold griefes, to warme and
        comfort the parts. The roote, by reason of the sharpenesse, is
        apt to drawe downe rheume, if it be tasted or chewed in the
        mouth.




CHAP. XXVI.

_Aconitum._   Wolfebane.


There be diuers sorts of Wolfebanes which are not fit for this booke,
but are reserued for a generall History or Garden of Simples, yet among
them there are some, that notwithstanding their euill quality, may for
the beauty of their flowers take vp a roome in this Garden, of whom I
meane to entreate in this place: And first of the Winter Wolfesbane,
which for the beauty, as well as the earlinesse of his flowers, being
the first of all other, that shew themselues after Christmas, deserueth
a prime place; and therefore for the likenesse of the rootes vnto the
Anemones, I ioyne it next vnto them.


1. _Aconitum Hyemale._   The Winters Wolfesbane.

This little plant thrusteth vp diuers leaues out of the ground, in the
deepe of Winter oftentimes, if there be any milde weather in Ianuary,
but most commonly after the deepe frosts, bearing vp many times the
snow vpon the heads of the leaues, which like vnto the Anemone, doe
euery leafe rise from the roote vpon seuerall short foote-stalkes,
not aboue foure fingers high, some hauing flowers in the middle of
them, (which come vp first most vsually) and some none, which leaues
stand as it were round, the stalke rising vp vnder the middle of the
leafe, deeply cut in and gashed to the middle stalke almost, of a
very faire deepe greene colour, in the middle whereof, close vnto the
leafe, standeth a small yellow flower, made of six leaues, very like
a Crowfoote, with yellow threads in the middle: after the flower is
fallen, there rise vp diuers small hornes or cods set together, wherein
are contained whitish yellow round seede. The roote is tuberous, so
like both for shape and colour vnto the rootes of Anemones, that they
will easily deceiue one not well experienced, but that it is browner
and smooth without, and yellow within, if it be broken.


2. _Aconitum flore albido, siue Aconitum luteum Ponticum._
The whitish yellow Wolfesbane.

This Wolfesbane shooteth not out of the ground vntill the Spring be
well begun, and then it sendeth forth great broad greene leaues, deeply
cut in about the edges, not much vnlike the leaues of the great wilde
Crowfoote, but much greater; from among which leaues riseth vp a strong
stiffe stalke, three foote high, hauing here and there leaues set
vpon it, like vnto the lowest, but smaller; the toppe of the stalke
is diuided into three or foure branches, whereon are set diuers pale
yellow flowers, which turne at the last to be almost white, in fashion
like almost vnto the flowers of the Helmet flower, but much smaller,
and not gaping so wide open: after the flowers are past come vp diuers
short poddes, wherein is contained blacke seede: the roote is made of
a number of darke browne strings, which spread and fasten themselues
strongly in the ground.


3. _Napellus verus flore cæruleo._   Blew Helmet flower or Monkes hood.

The Helmet flower hath diuers leaues of a fresh greene colour on the
vpperside, and grayish vnderneath, much spread abroad and cut into many
slits and notches, more then any of the Wolfebanes; the stalke riseth
vp two or three foot high, beset to the top with the like leaues, but
smaller: the toppe is sometimes diuided into two or three branches,
but more vsually without, whereon stand many large flowers one aboue
another, in forme very like vnto a Hood or open Helmet, being composed
of fiue leaues, the vppermost of which and the greatest, is hollow,
like vnto an Helmet or Headpeece, two other small leaues are at the
sides of the Helmet, closing it like cheekes, and come somewhat vnder,
and two other which are the smallest hang down like labels, or as if
a close Helmet were opened, and some peeces hung by, of a perfect or
faire blew colour, (but grow darker, hauing stood long) which causeth
it be so nourished vp in Gardens, that their flowers, as was vsuall in
former times, and yet is in many Countrey places, may be laid among
greene herbes in windowes and roomes for the Summer time: but although
their beauty may be entertained for the vses aforesaid, yet beware they
come not neare your tongue or lippes, lest they tell you to your cost,
they are not so good as they seeme to be: in the middest of the flower,
when it is open and gapeth wide, are seene certaine small threads like
beards, standing about a middle head, which when the flower is past,
groweth into three or foure, or more small blackish pods, containing in
them blacke seede: the rootes are brownish on the outside, and white
within, somewhat bigge and round aboue, and small downewards, somewhat
like vnto a small short Carrot roote, sometimes two being ioyned at the
head together. But the name _Napellus_ anciently giuen vnto it, doth
shew they referred the forme of the roote vnto a small Turnep.


_Anthora._   The wholsome Helmet flower, or counterpoison Monkes hood.

This wholsome plant I thought good to insert, not onely for the forme
of the flower, but also for the excellent properties thereof, as you
shall haue them related hereafter. The rootes hereof are small and
tuberous, round and somewhat long, ending for the most part in a long
fibre, and with some other small threads from the head downeward: from
the head whereof riseth vp diuers greene leaues, euery one seuerally
vpon a stalke, very much diuided, as finely almost as the leaues of
Larkes heeles or spurres: among which riseth vp a hard round stalke, a
foote high and better, with some such leaues thereon as grow belowe, at
the toppe whereof stand many small yellowish flowers, formed very like
vnto the former whitish Wolfesbane, bearing many blacke seedes in pods
afterwards in the like manner.

Many more sorts of varieties of these kindes there are, but these
onely, as the most specious, are noursed vp in Florists Gardens for
pleasure; the other are kept by such as are Catholicke obseruers of all
natures store.


        The Place.

        All these grow naturally on Mountaines, in many shadowie places
        of the Alpes, in Germany, and elsewhere.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth (as is said) in Ianuary, and February, and
        sometimes vntill March be well spent, and the seede soone ripe
        after.

        The other three flower not vntill Iune and Iuly.


        The Names.

        The first is vsually called _Aconitum hyemale Belgarum_.
        Lobelius, calleth it _Bulbosus vnifolius Batrachoides_,
        _Aconitum Elleboraceum_, and _Ranunculus Monophyllos_, and some
        by other names. Most Herbarists call it _Aconitum hyemale_,
        and we in English thereafter, Winters Wolfesbane; and of some,
        Yellow Aconite.

        The second is called by most Writers, _Aconitum luteum
        Ponticum_: Some also _Lupicida_, _Luparia_ and _Canicida_, of
        the effect in killing Wolues and Dogs: And some, because the
        flower is more white then yellow, doe call it _Aconitum flore
        albido_, we call it in English, The whitish yellow Aconite,
        or Wolfesbane, but some after the Latine name, The yellow
        Wolfesbane.

        The third is called generally _Napellus_, and _Verus_, because
        it is the true _Napellus_ of the ancient Writers, which they so
        termed from the forme of a Turnep, called _Napus_ in Latine.

        The fourth is called _Aconitum Salutiferum_, _Napellus Moysis_,
        _Antora_ and _Anthora, quasi Antithora_, that is, the remedy
        against the poisonfull herbe _Thora_, in English according to
        the title, eyther wholsome Helmet flower, or counterpoison
        Monkes hood.


        The Vertues.

        Although the first three sorts of plants be very poisonfull
        and deadly, yet there may bee very good vse made of them for
        sore eyes (being carefully applyed, yet not to all sorts of
        sore eyes neither without discretion) if the distilled water be
        dropped therein.

        The rootes of the counterpoison Monkes hood are effectuall not
        onely against the poison of the poisonfull Helmet flower, and
        all others of that kinde, but also against the poison of all
        venemous beasts, the plague or pestilence, and other infectious
        diseases, which raise spots, pockes, or markes in the outward
        skinne, by expelling the poison from within, and defending
        the heart as a most soueraigne Cordiall. It it vsed also with
        good successe against the wormes of the belly, and against the
        paines of the Wind collick.




CHAP. XXVII.

_Ranunculus._   The Crowfoote.


Next vnto the Aconites, of right are to follow the _Ranunculi_ or
Crowfeete, for the nearenesse both of forme, of leaues, and nature of
the plants, although lesse hurtfull, yet all of them for the most part
being sharpe and exulcerating, and not without some danger, if any
would be too bold with them. The whole Family of the _Ranunculi_ is of
a very large extent, and I am constrained within the limits of a Garden
of Pleasure; I must therefore select out onely such as are fit for
this purpose, and set them here downe for your knowledge, leauing the
rest for that other generall worke, which time may perfect and bring
to light, if the couetous mindes of some that should be most affected
towards it, doe not hinder it: or if the helpe of generous spirits
would forward it.


1. _Ranunculus montanus albus humilior._
The lowe white mountaine Crowfoot.

This lowe Crowfoote hath three or foure broad and thicke leaues,
almost round, yet a little cut in and notched about the edges, of a
fine greene and shining colour on the vpperside, and not so green
vnderneath, among which riseth a small short stalke, bearing one snow
white flower on the toppe, made of fiue round pointed leaues, with
diuers yellow threads in the middle, standing about a greene head,
which in time groweth to be full of seede, in forme like vnto a small
greene Strawberry: the roote is composed of many white strings.

[Sidenote: _Duplici flore._]

There is another of this lowe kinde, whose leaues are somewhat more
deeply cut in on the edges, and the flower larger, and sometimes a
little double, as it were with two rowes of leaues, in other things not
differing from the former.


2. _Ranunculus montanus albus maior vel elatior._
The great single white mountaine Crowfoote.

The leaues of this Crowfoote are large and greene, cut into three,
and sometimes into fiue speciall diuisions, and each of them besides
cut or notched about the edges, somewhat resembling the leaues of the
Globe Crowfoote, but larger: the stalke is two foote and a halfe high,
hauing three small leaues set at the ioynt of the stalke, where it
brancheth out into flowers, which stand foure or fiue together vpon
long foote-stalkes, made of fiue white leaues a peece, very sweete, and
somewhat larger then the next white Crowfoote, with some yellow threads
in the middle compassing a greene head, which bringeth seede like vnto
other wilde Crowfeete: the roote hath many long thicke whitish strings,
comming from a thicke head.


3. _Ranunculus montanus albus minor._
The lesser single white Crowfoote.

This Crowefoote hath faire large spread leaues, cut into fiue
diuisions, and somewhat notched about the edges, greene on the
vpperside, and paler vnderneath, hauing many veines running through the
leaues: the stalke of this riseth not so high as the former, although
this be reasonable tall, as being neare two foote high, spread into
many branches, bearing such like white flowers, as in the former, but
smaller: the seede of this is like the former, and so are the rootes
likewise.


4. _Ranunculus albus flore pleno._   The double white Crowfoote.

The double white Crowfoote is of the same kinde with the last single
white Crowfoote, hauing such like leaues in all respects: the onely
difference is in the flowers, which in this are very thicke and double.
Some doe make mention of two sorts of double white Crowfeete, one
somewhat lower then another, and the lower likewise bearing more store
of flowers, and more double then the higher: but I confesse, I haue
neuer seene but one sort of double, which is the same here expressed,
not growing very high, and reasonably well stored with flowers.


5. _Ranunculus præcox Rutæfolio siue Coriandrifolio._
The early Coriander leafed Crowfoote.


This Crowfoote hath three or foure very greene leaues, cut and diuided
into many small peeces, like vnto the wing of leaues of Rue, or rather
like the lower leaues of the Coriander (for they well resemble either
of them) euery of them standing vpon a long purplish stalke, at the
toppe whereof groweth the flower alone, being composed or made of
twelue small white leaues, broad pointed, and a little endented at
the ends, somewhat purplish on the outside, and white on the inside,
sustained by diuers small greene leaues, which are in stead of a cup or
huske: in the middle of the flower are many small white threads, tipt
with yellow pendents, standing about a small greene head, which after
groweth to bee full of seedes like a Strawberry, which knobs giue small
blackish seede: the roote is white and fibrous.


6. _Ranunculus Thalictrifolio maior._
The great colombine leafed Crowfoot.

The lower leaues of this Crowfoote haue long stalkes, and are very
like vnto the smaller leaues of Colombines, or the great Spanish
_Thalictrum_, which hath his leaues very like vnto a Colombine, foure
or fiue rising from the roote: the stalke riseth about a foote and
a halfe high, somewhat reddish, beset here and there with the like
leaues, at the toppe whereof stand diuers small white flowers, made of
fiue leaues a peece, with some pale white threads in the middle: the
seede is round and reddish, contained in small huskes or hornes: the
roote is made of a bush or tuft of white strings.


7. _Ranunculus Thalictrifolio minor Asphodeli radice._
The small white Colombine leafed Crowfoote.

This small Crowfoote hath three or foure winged leaues spread vpon the
ground, standing vpon long stalkes, and consisting of many small leaues
set together, spreading from the middle ribbe, euery leafe somewhat
resembling both in shape and colour the smallest and youngest leaues
of Colombines: the flowers are white, standing at the toppe of the
stalkes, made of fiue round leaues: the root hath three or foure thick,
short, and round yellowish clogs hanging at the head, like vnto the
Asphodill roote. The great Herball of Lyons, that goeth vnder the name
of _Daleschampius_, saith, that Dʳ. Myconus found it in Spaine, and
sent it vnder the name of Oenanthe; and therefore Ioannes Molineus who
is thought to haue composed that booke, set it among the vmbelliferous
plants, because the Oenanthes beare vmbels of flowers and seede, and
haue tuberous or cloggy rootes; but with what iudgement, let others
say, when they haue compared the vmbels of flowers and seede of the
Oenanthes, with the flowers and seede of this plant, and whether I haue
not more properly placed it among the _Ranunculi_ or Crowfeete, and
giuen it a denomination agreeable to his forme.


8. _Ranunculus Globosus._   The Globe Crowfoot.

This Crowfoote (which in the Northerne countries of England where it
groweth plentifully, is called Locker goulons) hath many faire, broad,
darke greene leaues next the ground, cut into fiue, sixe, or seuen
diuisions, and iagged besides at the edges; among which riseth vp a
stalke, whereon are set such like leaues as are belowe, but smaller,
diuided toward the toppe into some branches, on the which stand
seuerall large yellow flowers, alwayes folded inward, or as a close
flower neuer blowing open, as other flowers doe, consisting of eleuen
leaues for the most part, set or placed in three rowes, with many
yellow threads in the middle, standing about a greene rough head, which
in time groweth to be small knops, wherein are contained blacke seede:
the roote is composed of many blackish strings.


9. _Ranunculus pratensis flore multiplici._
The double yellow field Crowfoot.

There is little or no difference in the leaues of this double Crowfoot,
from those of the single kindes that growe in euery medowe, being large
and diuided into foure or fiue parts, and indented about the edges, but
they are somewhat smaller, and of a fresher greene: the flowers stand
on many branches, much diuided or separated, being not very great, but
very thicke and double: the roote runneth and creepeth vnder ground
like as the single doth.


10. _Ranunculus Anglicus maximus multiplex._
The Garden double yellow Crowfoot or Batchelours buttons.

This great double Crowfoote, which is common in euery Garden through
England, hath many great blackish greene leaues, iagged and cut into
three diuisions, each to the middle ribbe: the stalkes haue some
smaller leaues on them, and those next vnder the branches long and
narrow: the flowers are of a greenish yellow colour, very thicke and
double of leaues, in the middle whereof riseth vp a small stalke,
bearing another double flower, like to the other, but smaller: the
roote is round, like vnto a small white Turnep, with diuers other
fibres annexed vnto it.

]


11. _Ranunculus Gramineus._   Grasse leafed Crowfoot

The leaues of this Crowfoote are long and narrow, somewhat like vnto
Grasse, or rather like the leaues of single Gilloflowers or Pinckes,
being small and sharpe pointed, a little hollow, and of a whitish
greene colour; among these leaues rise vp diuers slender stalkes,
bearing one small flower at the toppe of each, consisting of fiue
yellow leaues, with some threads in the middle: the roote is composed
of many thicke, long, round white strings.

There is another of this kinde that beareth flowers with two rowes of
leaues, as if it were double, differing in nothing else.


12. _Ranunculus Lusitanicus Autumnalis._
The Portugall Autumne Crowfoot.

This Autumne Crowfoote hath diuers broad round leaues lying on the
ground, set vpon short foote-stalkes, of a faire greene colour aboue,
and grayish vnderneath, snipt all about the edges, hauing many veines
in them, and sometimes swelling as with blisters or bladders on them;
from among which rise vp two or three slender and hairy stalkes,
bearing but one small yellow flower a peece, consisting of fiue and
sometimes of six leaues, and sometimes of seuen or eight, hauing a few
threads in the middle, set about a small greene head, like vnto many of
the former Crowfeete, which bringeth small blacke seede: the roote is
made of many thicke short white strings, which seeme to be grumous or
kernelly rootes, but that they are somewhat smaller, and longer then
any other of that kinde.


13. _Ranunculus Creticus latifolius._
The broad leafed Candy Crowfoot.

This Crowfoote of Candy, hath the greatest and broadest leaues of all
the sorts of Crowfeete, being almost round, and without any great
diuisions, but onely a few notches about the edges here and there,
as large or larger sometimes then the palme of a mans hand; among
which riseth vp the stalke, not very high when it doth first flower,
but afterwards, as the other flowers doe open themselues, the stalke
groweth to be a foote and a halfe high, or thereabouts, hauing some
leaues on it, deeply cut in or diuided, and bearing many faire yellow
flowers, consisting of fiue leaues a peece, being somewhat whitish in
the middle, when the flower hath stood blowne a little time: the roote
is composed of a number of small kernelly knobs, or long graines, set
thicke together. This flowreth very early, being vsually in flower
before the end of March, and oftentimes about the middle thereof.


14. _Ranunculus Creticus albus._   The white Candy Crowfoote.

The leaues of this Crowfoote are very like vnto the leaues of the red
Crowfoote of Tripoli or Asia, hereafter set downe, being somewhat
broad and indented about the edges, some of the leaues being also cut
in or gashed, thereby making it as it were three diuisions, of a pale
greene colour, with many white spots in them: the stalke riseth vp a
foote high, with some leaues on it, more diuided then the lower, and
diuided at the toppe into two and sometimes into three branches, each
of them bearing a faire snow white flower, somewhat large, included at
the first in a brownish huske or cup of leaues, which afterwards stand
vnder the flowers, consisting of fiue white large round pointed leaues,
in the middle whereof is set many blackish purple thrums, compassing
a small long greene head, composed of many scales or chaffie whitish
huskes, when they are ripe, which are the seede, but vnprofitable in
all that euer I could obserue: the rootes are many small graines or
kernels, set together as in the former, and much about the same colour,
that is, of a darke or duskie grayish colour, but much smaller.

[Sidenote: _Alba purpureis oris & venis._]

There is another of this kinde, whose flowers haue purple edges, and
sometimes some veines of the same purple in the leaues of the flowers,
not differing in any other thing from the former.

[Sidenote: _Alba oris rubris._]

And another, whose edges of the flowers are of a bright red colour.

15. _Ranunculus Creticus flore argenteo._
The Argentine, or cloth of siluer Crowfoot.

The greene leaues of this Crowfoote are as small and thinne, cut in
or diuided on the edges, as the last two sorts; the stalke riseth
vp somewhat higher, and diuided into some branches, bearing at the
toppe of euery of them one flower, somewhat smaller then the former,
composed of six, seuen, and sometimes of eight small round pointed
leaues, of a whitish yellow blush colour on the inside wholly, except
sometimes a little stript about the edges: but the outside of euery
leafe is finely stript with crimson stripes, very thicke, somewhat
like vnto a Gilloflower: in the middle riseth vp a small blacke head,
compassed about with blackish blew threads or thrums, which head is as
vnfruitfull for seede in our Countrey as the former. This flower hath
no such greene leaues vnder it, or to enclose it before it be blowne
open as the former: the rootes are in all things like the former.


16. _Ranunculus Asiaticus siue Tripolitanus flore rubro._
The single red Crowfoote of Asia or Tripoli.

The lower leaues of this red Crowfoote are alwayes whole without
diuisions, being onely somewhat deeply indented about the edges, but
the other that rise after them are more cut in, sometimes into three,
and sometimes into fiue diuisions, and notched also about the edges:
the stalke riseth higher then any of the former, and hath on it two or
three smaller leaues, more cut in and diuided then those belowe: at the
toppe whereof standeth one large flower, made of fiue leaues, euery one
being narrower at the bottome then at the toppe, and not standing close
and round one to another, but with a certaine distance betweene, of a
duskie yellowish red colour on the outside, and of a deepe red on the
inside, the middle being set with many thrums of a darke purple colour:
the head for seede is long, and scaly or chaffie, and idle in like
manner as the rest: the roote is made of many graines or small kernels
set together, and closing at the head, but spreading it selfe, if it
like the ground, vnder the vpper crust of the earth into many rootes,
encreasing from long strings, that runne from the middle of the small
head of graines, as well as at the head it selfe.


17. _Ranunculus Asiaticus flore amplo rubro._
The large single red Crowfoot of Asia.

There hath come to vs out of Turkie, together with the former, among
many other rootes, vnder the same title, a differing sort of this
Crowfoote, whose leaues weare broader, and much goaler; the flower also
larger, and the leaues thereof broader, sometimes eight in a flower,
standing round and close one to another, which maketh the fairer shew:
in all other things it is like the former.


18. _Ranunculus Asiaticus flore rubro vario simplici._
The red stript single Crowfoote of Asia.

This party coloured Crowfoote differeth not eyther in roote or leafe
from the former, the chiefest difference is in the flower, which being
red, somewhat like the former, hath yet some yellow stripes or veines
through euery leafe, sometimes but little, and sometimes so much, that
it seemeth to bee party coloured red and yellow: this sort is very
tender; for we haue twice had it, and yet perished with vs.


19. _Ranunculus Asiaticus flore luteo vario simplici._
The yellow stript single Crowfoote of Asia.

There is little difference in the roote of this Crowfoote from the last
described, but the leaues are much different, being very much diuided,
and the flower is large, of a fine pale greenish yellow colour,
consisting of six and seuen, and sometimes of eight or nine round
leaues; the toppes whereof haue reddish spots, and the edges sometimes
also, with such purplish thrums in the middle that the other haue. None
of these former Crowfeete with kernelly rootes, haue euer beene found
to haue giuen so good seed in England, as that being sowne, any of them
would spring vp; for hereof tryall hath been often made, but all they
haue lost their labour, that haue bestowed their paines therein, as
farre as I know.


20. _Ranunculus Asiaticus flore rubro pleno._
The double red Crowfoote of Asia.

The double red Crowfoote hath his rootes and leaues so like vnto the
single red kinde, that none can perceiue any difference, or know the
one from the other, vntill the budde of the flower doe appeare, which
after it is any thing forward, may be perceiued to be greater and
fuller then the budde of the single kinde. This kinde beareth most
vsually but one faire large double flower on the toppe of the stalke,
composed of many leaues, set close together in three or foure rowes, of
an excellent crimson colour, declining to Scarlet, the outter leaues
being larger then the inner; and instead of thrummes, hath many small
leaues set together: it hath likewise six small narrow greene leaues on
the backside of the flower, where the stalke is fastened to the flower.

[Sidenote: _Prolifero flore._]

There is of this double kinde another sort, whose flower is of the same
colour with the former, but out of the middle of the flower ariseth
another double flower, but smaller.


        The Place.

        These plants grow naturally in diuers Countries; some in
        France, and Germany, and some in England, some in Spaine,
        Portugall, and Italy, and some haue been sent out of Turkie
        from Constantinople, and some from other parts, their titles
        for the most part descrying their Countries.


        The Time.

        Some of them flower early, as is set downe in their
        descriptions, or titles. The others in Aprill and May. The
        white Candy Crowfoote, and the other single and double sorts
        of Asia, about the same time, or somewhat later, and one in
        Autumne, as it is set downe.


        The Names.

        The names that are giuen seuerally to them may well serue
        this worke, that thereby they may bee distinguished one from
        another: For to set downe any further controuersie of names,
        how fitly or vnfitly they haue beene called, and how variably
        by diuers former Writers, is fitter for a generall History,
        vnto which I leaue what may be said, both concerning these
        and the rest: Onely this I would giue you to vnderstand, that
        the Turkie kindes haue been sent to vs vnder the names of
        _Terobolos_ for the single, and _Terobolos Catamer lale_ for
        the double, and yet oftentimes, those that haue been sent for
        double, haue proued single, so little fidelity is to bee found
        among them.


        The Vertues.

        All or most of these plants are very sharpe and exulcerating,
        yet the care and industry of diuers learned men haue found many
        good effects in many of them. For the rootes and leaues both of
        the wilde kindes, and of some of these of the Garden, stamped
        and applyed to the wrists, haue driuen away the fits in Feuers.
        The roote likewise of the double English kinde is applyed for
        pestilent sores, to helpe to breake them, by drawing the venome
        to the place. They helpe likewise to take away scarres and
        markes in diuers places of the body.




CHAP. XXVIII.


_Caltha palustris flore pleno._   Double Marsh Marigold.

As an appendix to the Crowfeete, I must needes adde this plant, yet
seuerally by it selfe, because both it and his single kinde are by
most adioyned thereunto, for the neare resemblance both in shape and
sharpnesse of quality. The single kinde I leaue to the Ditch sides, and
moist grounds about them, as the fittest places for it, and onely bring
the double kinde into my Garden, as fittest for his goodly proportion
and beauty to be entertained, and haue place therein.

The double Marsh Marigold hath many broad and round greene leaues, a
little endented about the edges, like vnto the single kinde, but not
altogether so large, especially in a Garden where it standeth not very
moist: the stalkes are weake, round, hollow, and greene, diuided into
three or foure branches at the toppe, with leaues at the seuerall
ioynts, whereon stand very double flowers, of a gold yellow colour:
the fiue outer leaues being larger then any of the rest that are
encompassed by them, which fall away after they haue stood blowne a
great while (for it endureth in flower a moneth or more, especially if
it stand in a shadowie place) without bearing any seed: the rootes are
composed of many thicke, long, and round whitish strings, which runne
downe deep into the ground, and there are fastened very strongly.


        The Place.

        This plant groweth naturally in diuers Marshes, and moist
        grounds in Germany, yet in some more double then in others; it
        hath long agoe beene cherished in our Gardens.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in Aprill or May, as the yeare proueth earlier or
        later: all his leaues doe in a manner quite perish in Winter,
        and spring anew in the end of February, or thereabouts.


        The Names.

        There is great controuersie among the learned about the single
        kinde, but thereof I shall not neede to speake in this place;
        if God permit I may in a fitter. This is called generally in
        Latine, _Caltha palustris multiplex_, or _flore pleno_. And
        wee in English (after the Latine, which take _Caltha_ to be
        that which wee vsually call _Calendula_, a Marigold) The double
        Marsh Marigold.


        The Vertues.

        The roote hereof is sharpe, comming neare vnto the quality of
        the Crowfeete, but for any speciall property, I haue not heard
        or found any.




CHAP. XXIX.


_Hepatica nobilis siue trifolia._   Noble Liuerwort.

Next vnto the Crowfeete are to follow the Hepaticas, because of the
likenesse with them, seeming to be small Crowfeete in all their
parts, but of another and more wholsome kinde. Their diuersity among
themselues consisteth chiefly in the colour of the flowers, all of them
being single, except one which is very thicke and double.


1. _Hepatica flore cæruleo simplici maior._
The great single blew Hepatica or noble Liuerwort.

The flowers of this Hepatica doe spring vp, blow open, and sometimes
shed and fall away, before any leaues appeare or spread open. The
rootes are composed of a bush of blackish things, from the seuerall
heads or buttons whereof, after the flowers are risen and blowne, arise
many fresh greene leaues, each seuerally standing vpon his foot-stalke,
folded together, and somewhat browne and hairy at their first comming,
which after are broad, and diuided at the edges into three parts: the
flowers likewise stand euery one vpon his owne seuerall foote-stalke,
of the same height with the leaues for the most part, which is about
foure or fiue fingers breadth high, made of six leaues most vsually,
but sometimes it will haue seuen or eight, of a faire blew colour, with
many white chiues or threads in the middle, standing about a middle
green head or vmbone, which after the flower is fallen groweth greater,
and sheweth many small graines or seede set close together (with three
small greene leaues compassing them vnderneath, as they did the flower
at the bottome) very like the head of seed of manie Crowfeete.


2. _Hepatica minor flore pallido cæruleo._   The small blew Hepatica.

The leaues of this Hepatica are smaller by the halfe then the former,
and grow more aboundantly, or bushing thicke together: the flowers
(when it sheweth them, for I haue had the plant halfe a score yeares,
and yet neuer saw it beare flower aboue once or twice) are of a pale or
bleake blew colour, not so large as the flowers of the former.


3. _Hepatica flore purpureo._   Purple Hepatica or noble Liuerwort.

This Hepatica is in all things like vnto the first, but onely the
flowers are of a deeper blew tending to a Violet purple: and therefore
I shall not neede to reiterate the former description.


4. _Hepatica flore albo minor._   The lesser white Hepatica.

The flowers of this Hepatica are wholly white, of the bignesse of the
red or purple, and the leaues somewhat smaller, and of a little whiter
of paler greene colour, else in all other things agreeing with the
former.


5. _Hepatica alba magno flore._   The great white Hepatica.

There is no other difference herein from the last, but that the flower
being as white, is as large as the next.


6. _Hepatica albida siue argentea._
Ash-coloured of Argentine Hepatica.

Both the leaues and the flowers of this Hepatica are larger then any of
the former, except the last: the flowers hereof at the first opening
seeme to bee of a blush ash-colour, which doe so abide three or foure
dayes, decaying still vntill it turne almost white, hauing yet still a
shew of that blush ash-colour in them, till the very last.


7. _Hepatica alba straminibus rubris._
White Hepatica with red threads.

There is no difference between this Hepatica and the first white one,
sauing that the threads in the middle of the flower, being white, as in
the former, are tipt at the ends with a pale reddish colour, which adde
a great beauty to the flowers.


8. _Hepatica flore rubro._   Red Hepatica or noble Liuerwort.

The leaues of this Hepatica are of a little browner red colour, both at
their first comming vp, and afterwards, especially in the middle of the
leafe more then any of the former: the flowers are in forme like vnto
the rest, but of a bright blush, or pale red colour, very pleasant to
behold, with white threads or chiues in the middle of them.


9. _Hepatica flore purpureo multiplici siue pleno._
The double purple Hepatica.

The double Hepatica is in all things like vnto the single purple
kinde, sauing onely that the leaues are larger, and stand vpon longer
foote-stalkes, and that the flowers are small buttons, but very thicke
of leaues, and as double as a flower can be, like vnto the double white
Crowfoote before described, but not so bigge, of a deepe blew or purple
colour, without any threads or head in the middle, which fall away
without giuing any seede.


10. _Hepatica flore cæruleo pleno._   The double blew Hepatica.

In the colour of this flower, consisteth the chiefest difference from
the last, except one may say it is a little lesse in the bignesse of
the flower, but not in doublenesse of leaues.


        The Place.

        All these plants with single flowers grow naturally in the
        Woods, and shadowie Mountaines of Germany in many places, and
        some of them in Italy also. The double kinde likewise hath been
        sent from Alphonsus Pantius out of Italy, as Clusius reporteth,
        and was also found in the Woods, neare the Castle of Starnbeg
        in Austria, the Lady Heusenstains possession, as the same
        Clusius reporteth also.


        The Time.

        These plants doe flower very early, and are of the first
        flowers that shew themselues presently after the deepe frosts
        in Ianuary, so that next vnto the Winter Wolfesbane, these
        making their pride appeare in Winter, are the more welcome
        early guests. The double kinde flowreth not altogether so
        early, but sheweth his flower, and abideth when the others are
        past.


        The Names.

        They haue obtained diuers names; some calling them _Hepatica_,
        _Hepatica nobilis_, _Hepaticum trifolium_, _Trifolium
        nobile_, _Trifolium aureum_, and some _Trinitas_, and _Herba
        Trinitatis_. In English you may call them either Hepatica,
        after the Latine name, as most doe, or Noble Liuerwort, which
        you please.


        The Vertues.

        These are thought to coole and strengthen the liuer, the name
        importing as much; but I neuer saw any great vse of them by any
        the Physitians of our London Colledge, or effect by them that
        haue vsed them in Physicke in our Country.

CHAP. XXX.

_Geranium._   Storkes bill or Cranes bill.


As was said before concerning the Crowfeet, of their large extent and
restraint, the like may be said of the Storkes bils or Cranes bils;
for euen of these as of them, I must for this worke set forth the
descriptions but of a few, and leaue the rest to a generall worke.


1. _Geranium tuberosum vel bulbosum._   Bulbous or knobbed Cranes bill.

The knobbed Cranes hath three or foure large leaues spread vpon the
ground, of a grayish or rather dusty greene colour, euery one of them
being as it were of a round forme, but diuided or cut into six or
seuen long parts or diuisions, euen vnto the middle, which maketh it
seeme to be so many leaues, each of the cuts or diuisions being deeply
notched or indented on both sides; among which riseth vp a stalke a
foote high or better, bearing thereon diuers pale but bright purple
flowers, made of fiue leaues a peece, after which come small heads with
long pointed beakes, resembling the long bill of a Storke or Crane, or
such like bird, which after it is ripe, parteth at the bottome where
it is biggest, into foure or fiue seedes, euery one whereof hath a
peece of the beake head fastened vnto it, and falleth away if it bee
not gathered: the roote is tuberous and round, like vnto the roote of
the _Cyclamen_ or ordinary Sowbread almost, but smaller, and of a darke
russet colour on the outside, and white within, which doth encrease
vnder ground, by certaine strings running from the mother root into
small round bulbes, like vnto the rootes of the earth Chesnut, and will
presently shoote leaues, and quickly grow to beare flowers, but will
not abide to be kept long dry out of the ground, without danger to be
vtterly spoiled.


2. _Geranium Batrachoides flore cæruleo._
The blew Crowfoote Cranes bill.

This Crowfoote Cranes bill hath many large leaues, cut into fiue or
fix parts or diuisions, euen to the bottome, and iagged besides on the
edges, set vpon very long slender foote-stalkes, very like the leaues
of the wilde Crowfoot; from among which rise vp diuers stalkes with
great ioynts, somewhat reddish, set with leaues like the former: the
toppes of the stalkes are spread into many branches, whereon stand
diuers flowers, made of fiue leaues a peece, as large as any of the
wilde or field Crowfeete, round pointed, of a faire blew or watchet
colour, which being past, there doe arise such heads or bils, as other
of the Cranes bils haue: the roote is composed of many reddish strings,
spreading in the ground, from a head made of diuers red heads, which
lye oftentimes eminent aboue the ground.


3. _Geranium Batrachoides flore albo._
The white Crowfoote Cranes bill.

This Cranes bill is in leafe and flower altogether like the former, the
onely difference betweene them consisteth in the colour of the flower,
which in this is wholly white, and as large as the former: but the
roote of this hath not such red heads as the other hath.


4. _Geranium Batrachoides flore albo & cæruleo vario._
The party coloured Crowfoote Cranes bill.

The flowers of this Cranes bill are variably striped and spotted, and
sometimes diuided, the one halfe of euery leafe being white, and the
other halfe blew, sometimes with lesser or greater spots of blew in the
white leafe, very variably, and more in some years then in others, that
it is very hard to expresse all the varieties that may be obserued in
the flowers, that blow at one time. In all other parts of the plant, it
is so like vnto the former, that vntill it be in flower, the one cannot
be knowne from the other.


5. _Geranium Batrachoides alterum flore purpureo._
Purple Crowfoote Cranes bill.

This purple Cranes bill hath many leaues rising from the roote, set
vpon long foot-stalkes, somewhat like vnto the other, yet not so broad,
but more diuided or cut, that is, into seuen or more slits, euen to
the middle, each whereof is likewise cut in on the edges more deeply
then the former; the stalkes are somewhat knobbed at the ioynts, set
with leaues like vnto the lower, and bearing a great tuft of buds at
the toppes of the branches, which breake out into faire large flowers,
made of fiue purple leaues, which doe somewhat resemble the flower of
a Mallow, before it be too full blowne, each whereof hath a reddish
pointell in the middle, and many small threads compassing it, this
vmbell or tuft of buds doe flower by degrees, and not all at once, and
euery flower abideth open little more then one day, and then sheddeth,
so that euery day yeeldeth fresh flowers, which because they are so
many, are a long while before they are all past or spent: after the
flowers are past, there arise small beake heads or bils, like vnto the
other Cranes bils, with small turning seede: the roote is composed of a
great tuft of strings, fattened to a knobby head.


6. _Geranium Romanum versicolor siue striatum._
The variable stript Cranes bill.

This beautifull Cranes bill hath many broad yellowish greene leaues
arising from the roote, diuided into fiue or six parts, but not vnto
the middle as the first kindes are: each of these leaues hath a
blackish spot at the bottome corners of the diuisions, the whole leafe
as well in forme as colour and spots, is very like vnto the leafe of
the _Geranium fuscum_, or spotted Cranes bill, next following to be
described, but that the leaues of this are not so large as the other:
from among these leaues spring vp sundry stalkes a foote high and
better, ioynted and knobbed here and there, bearing at the tops two
or three small white flowers, consisting of fiue leaues a peece, so
thickly & variably striped with fine small reddish veines, that no
green leafe that is of that bignesse can shew so many veines in it,
nor so thick running as euery leafe of this flower doth: in the middle
of the flower standeth a small pointell, which when the flower is part
doth grow to be the seed vessell, whereon is set diuers small seeds,
like vnto the small seedes of other Cranes bils: the root is made of
many small yellow threads or strings.


7. _Geranium fuscum siue maculatum._
Swart tawny or spotted Cranes bill.

The leaues of this Cranes bill are in all points like the last
described, as well in the forme and diuisions as colour of the leaues,
being of a yellowish greene colour, but larger and stronger by much:
the stalkes of this rise much higher, and are ioynted or knobbed with
reddish knees or ioynts, on the tops whereof stand not many although
large flowers, consisting of fiue leaues a peece, each whereof is round
at the end, and a little snipt round about, and doe bend or turne
themselues backe to stalkewards, making the middle to be highest or
most eminent; the colour of the flower is of a darke or deepe blackish
purple, the bottome of euery leafe being whiter than the rest; it hath
also a middle pointell standing out, which afterwards bring forth seede
like vnto others of his kinde: the roote consisteth of diuers great
strings, ioyned to a knobby head.


8. _Geranium Hematodes._   The red Rose Cranes bill.

This Cranes bill hath diuers leaues spread vpon the ground, very much
cut in or diuided into many parts, and each of them againe slit or cut
into two or three peeces, standing vpon slender long foote-stalkes,
of a faire greene colour all the Spring and Summer, but reddish in
Autumne: among these leaues spring vp slender and weake stalkes, beset
at euery ioynt (which is somewhat reddish) with two leaues for the most
part, like vnto the lower: the flowers grow seuerally on the toppe of
the stalkes, and not many together in bunches or branches, as in all
other Cranes bils, euery flower being as large as a single Rose Campion
flower, consisting of fiue large leaues, of a deeper red colour then
in any other Cranes bill at the first opening, and will change more
blewish afterwards: when the flower is past, there doth arise such like
beakes as are in others of the same kinde, but small: the roote is
hard, long, and thicke, with diuers branches spreading from it, of a
reddish yellow colour on the outside, and whitish within, which abideth
and perisheth not, but shooteth forth some new greene leaues, which
abide all the Winter, although those that turne red doe fall away.


_Geranium Creticum._   Candy Cranes bill.

Candy Cranes bill beareth long and tender stalkes, whereon growe diuers
broad and long leaues, cut in or iagged on the edges: the toppes of
the stalkes are branched into many flowers, made of fiue leaues of a
reasonable bignesse, and of a faire blew or watchet colour, with a
purplish pointell in the middle, which being past, there follow beake
heads like other Cranes bils, but greater, containing larger, greater,
and sharper pointed seede, able to pierce the skinne, if one be not
warie of it: the roote is white and long, with some fibres at it, and
perisheth when it hath perfected his seede, and will spring of it owne
sowing many times, if the Winter be not too sharpe, otherwise (being
annuall) it must be sowne in the Spring of the yeare.


        The Place.

        Most of these Cranes bils are strangers vnto vs by nature,
        but endenizond in our English Gardens. It hath beene reported
        vnto mee by some of good credit, that the second or Crowfoot
        Cranes bill hath been found naturally growing in England, but
        yet I neuer saw it, although I haue seen many sorts of wilde
        kindes in many places. Matthiolus saith that the first groweth
        in Dalmatia and Illyria very plentifully. Camerarius, Clusius,
        and others, that most of the rest grow in Germany, Bohemia,
        Austria, &c. The last hath his place recorded in his title.


        The Time.

        All these Cranes bils doe for the most part flower in Aprill,
        and May, and vntill the middle of Iune. The variable or stript
        Cranes bill is vsually the latest of all the rest.


        The Names.

        The first is vsually called _Geranium tuberosum_, of some
        _Geranium bulbosum_, of the likenesse of the roote vnto
        a bulbe: It is without controuersie _Geranium primum_ of
        Dioscorides. The second is called _Geranium Gratia Dei_, of
        others, _Geranium cæruleum_. The blew Cranes bill Lobel calleth
        it _Batrachoides_, because both leafe and flower are like vnto
        a Crowfoote; and the affinity with the Cranes bils in the
        seede causeth it rather to be referred to them then to the
        Crowfeete. The stript Cranes bill is called by some _Geranium
        Romanum_. The last sauing one is called _Geranium Hæmatodes_,
        or _Sanguineum_, of Lobel _Geranium Gruinale Hæmatodes supinum
        radice repente_. In English it may be called after the Greek
        and Latine, The bloudy Cranes bill, but I rather call it, The
        Rose Cranes bill, because the flowers are as large as single
        Roses, or as the Rose Campion. Some of them are called in many
        places of England Bassinets.


        The Vertues.

        All the kindes of Cranes bils are accounted great wound herbes,
        and effectuall to stay bleedings, yet some more than others.
        The Emperickes of Germanie, as Camerarius saith, extoll it
        wonderfully, for a singular remedie against the Stone, both in
        the reines and bladder.




CHAP. XXXI.

_Sanicula guttata maior._   Spotted Sanicle.


Hauing long debated with my selfe, where to place this & the other
plants that follow in the two next Chapters, I haue thought it not
amisse for this worke to set them downe here, both before the Beares
eares, which are kindes of Sanicle, as the best Authors doe hold, and
after the Cranes bils, both for some qualities somewhat resembling
them, and for some affinity of the flowers with the former.

The spotted Sanicle hath many small round leaues, bluntly endented
about the edges, somewhat like vnto the leaues of our white Saxifrage,
of a full greene colour aboue, and whitish hairy, and somewhat reddish
withall vnderneath: the stalkes are set here and there with the like
leaues, rising a foote and a halfe high or more, very much diuided at
the toppe into sundry small branches, bearing many very small white
flowers, consisting of fiue small leaues, wherein are many small red
spots to be seene, as small as pins points, of a pretty sweete sent,
almost like Hawthorne flowers, in the middle whereof are many small
threads compassing a head, which when it is ripe containeth small
blacke seede: the roote is scaly, or couered with a chaffie matter,
hauing many small white fibres vnderneath, whereby it is fastened in
the ground.

[Sidenote: _Minor non guttata._]

There is another of this kinde, like both in roote, leafe, and flower
to the former, the onely difference is, that this is lesser then the
former, and hath no spots in the flower, as the other hath.

[Sidenote: _Minus guttata._]

We haue also another smaller kinde then the last, both in leafe and
flower, the leaues whereof are smaller, but rounder, and more finely
snipt or indented about the edges, like the teeth of a fine sawe: the
stalke is little aboue a span high, hauing many small white flowers
spotted as the first, but with fewer spots.


        The Place.

        These growe in the shadowie Woods of the Alpes, in diuers
        places, and with vs they more delight in the shade then the
        sunne.


        The Time.

        All these Sanicles doe flower in May, and continue flowring
        vntill Iune, and the seede soone ripeneth after: the rootes
        abide all the Winter, with some leaues on them, springing a
        fresh in the beginning of the yeare.


        The Names.

        The former two are called by Clusius _Sanicula montana_, and by
        others _Sanicula guttata_: by Lobel _Geum Alpinum_. The third
        or last hath been sent vs vnder the name of _Sanicula montana
        altera minor_.


        The Vertues.

        The name imposed on these plants doe certainly assure vs of
        their vertues, from the first founders, that they are great
        healers, and from their taste, that they are great binders.




CHAP. XXXII.


_Cotyledon altera Matthioli._   Spotted Nauelwort.

This spotted Nauelwort, as many doe call it, hath many thicke small
leaues, not so broad as long, of a whitish greene colour, lying on the
ground in circles, after the manner of the heads of Houseleeke, and
dented about the edges; from the middle whereof sometimes (for it doth
not flower euery yeare in many places) ariseth vp a stalke, scarce a
foote high, beset with such like leaues as are belowe, but somewhat
longer: from the middle of the stalke vp to the top it brancheth forth
diuersly, with a leafe at euery ioynt, bearing three or foure flowers
on euery branch, consisting of fiue white leaues, spotted with small
red spots, like vnto the spotted Sanicle, but with fewer and greater
spots, hauing a yellowish circle or eye in the bottome of euery flower,
and many whitish threads with yellowish tips in it: the seede is small
and blacke, contained in small round heads: the roote is small, long,
and threadie, shooting out such heads of leaues, which abide all the
Winter, those that beare flower perishing.


_Cotyledon altera minor._   Small dented Nauelwort.

There is another like vnto that before described in most things, the
differences be these: It hath shorter leaues then the former, and
dented about the edges in the like manner: the flowers hereof are
white, but greater, made of six leaues, and most vsually without any
spots at all in them, some are seene to haue spots also: the heads or
seede vessels are more cornered then the former.


_Cotyledon altera flore rubro stellato._   Small red flowred Nauelwort.

This hath also many heads of leaues, but more open, which are longer,
greener, and sharper pointed then eyther of the former, somewhat
reddish also, and not dented about the edges, but yet a little rough
in handling: the stalke ariseth from among the leaues, being somewhat
reddish, and the leaues thereon are reddish pointed, diuided at the
toppe into many branches, with diuers flowers thereon, made of twelue
small long leaues, standing like a starre, of a reddish purple colour,
with many threads therein, set about the middle head, which is diuided
at the toppe into many small ends, like pods or hornes, containing
therein very small seede: the roote is small like the former.


_Sedum serratum flore rubente maculato._   The Princes Feather.

This kinde of Sengreene is composed of heads of larger, broader, and
thinner leaues then any of the former, of a sadder greene colour,
somewhat vneuenly endented about the edges, and not so close set
together, but spreading forth into seuerall heads like as the former
sorts doe, although not so plentifully; from the middle of diuers of
which heads rise vp brownish or reddish stalkes, set with smaller
leaues thereon to the middle thereof, and then brancheth forth into
seuerall sprigs, set with diuers small reddish flowers consisting of
fiue leaues a peece, the innerside of which are of a pale red, somewhat
whitish, spotted with many small bloud red spots, as small almost as
pins points, with some small threads in the middle, standing about a
small greene head, which turneth into the seede vessell, parted foure
wayes at the head, wherein is contained small blackish seede: the
rootes are small threads, which spread vnder the ground, and shoote vp
seuerall heads round about it.


        The Place.

        All these growe in Germany, Hungarie, Austria, the Alpes, and
        other such like places, where they cleaue to the rocke it
        selfe, that hath but a crust of earth on it to nourish them.
        They will abide in Gardens reasonable well, if they be planted
        in shadowie places, and not in the sun.

        Nauelwort.
   5 _Sedum serratum flore rubente maculato._ The Princes Feather.
   6 _Soldanella Alpina._ Blew Moonwort.
]


        The Time.

        They flower for the most part in the end of May, and sometimes
        sooner or later, as the yeare falleth out.


        The Names.

        The first is called by Matthiolus, _Cotyledon altera
        Dioscoridis_, and _Vmbilicus alter_, but it is not the true
        _Cotyledon altera_ of Dioscorides; for _Sedum vulgare maius_,
        Our common Houseleeke, by the consent of the best moderne
        Writers, is the true _Cotyledon altera_ of Dioscorides, or
        _Vmbilicus Veneris alter_. I hold it rather to bee a kinde of
        small Houseleeke, as the other two likewise are. The second is
        called by some _Aizoum_ or _Sedum minus serratum_. The third
        hath his name in his title. Wee doe call them Nauelworts in
        English rather then Houseleekes, _Euphoniæ gratia_. The last
        may be called dented Sengreene with reddish spotted flowers,
        but some of our English Gentlewomen haue called it, The Princes
        Feather, which although it be but a by-name, may well serve for
        this plant to distinguish it, and whereby to be knowne.


        The Vertues.

        They are all held to be cold and moist, like vnto other
        Houseleekes.




CHAP. XXXIII.

_Soldanella Alpina._   Mountaine Soldanella or blew Moonewort.


This beautifull plant hath many round and hard leaues, set vpon long
foote-stalkes, a little vneuenly cut about the edges, greene on the
vpperside, and of a grayish greene vnderneath, and sometime reddish
like the leaues of Sowbread, which because they doe somewhat resemble
the leaues of _Soldanella marina_, which is the Sea Bindweede, tooke
the name thereof: the stalkes are slender, small, round, and reddish,
about a span high, bearing foure or fiue flowers at the toppe, euery
one hanging downe their heads, like vnto a Bell flower, consisting but
of one leafe (as most of the Bindweeds doe) plated into fiue folds,
each of them ending in a long point, which maketh the flower seem to
haue fiue leaues, each whereof is deeply cut in on the edges, and
hauing a round greene head in the middle, with a pricke or pointell at
the end thereof: the flower is of a faire blew colour, sometimes deeper
or paler, or white, as nature listeth without any smell at all: the
middle head, after the flower is fallen, riseth to be a long round pod,
bearing that pricke it had at the end thereof, wherein is contained
small greenish seede: the roote hath many fibres shooting from a long
round head or roote.


        The Place.

        This groweth on the Alpes, which are couered with snow the
        greatest part of the yeare, and will hardly abide transplanting.


        The Time.

        In the naturall places it flowreth not vntill the Summer
        moneths, Iune, Iuly, and August, after the snow is melted from
        the Hils, but being brought into Gardens, it flowreth in the
        beginning of Aprill or thereabouts.


        The Names.

        This plant, by reason of the likenesse of leaues with
        _Soldanella_, as was before said, is called by many
        _Soldanella_, but yet is no Bindweede; and therefore I rather
        call it in English a Mountaine Soldanella, then as Gerrard
        doth, Mountaine Bindweede. It is likewise called by some,
        _Lunaria minor cærulea_, The lesser blew Lunary or Moonwort,
        and so I would rather haue it called.


        The Vertues.

        They that imposed the name of _Lunaria_ vpon this plant, seeme
        to referre it to the wound or consolidating herbes, but because
        I haue no further relation or experience, I can say no more
        thereof vntill tryall hath taught it. Some also from the name
        _Soldanella_, which is giuen it, because of the likenesse of
        the leaues, haue vsed it to help the Dropsie, for which the Sea
        plant is thought to be effectuall.




CHAP. XXXIIII.

_Auricula Vrsi._   Beares eares.


There are so many sundry and seuerall sorts of Beares eares, the
variety consisting as well in the differing colours of the flowers, as
the forme and colour of the leaues, that I shall not comprehend and set
downe vnto you all the diuersities by many, that are risen vp to those
that haue beene industrious in the sowing of the seedes of the seuerall
sorts of them; yet if you accept of these that I doe here offer vnto
you, I shall giue you the knowledge of others, as time, occasion, and
the view of them shall enable me. And because they are without all
question kinds of Cowslips, I haue set them downe before them in the
first place, as being of more beautie and greater respect, or at the
least of more rarity vnto vs. To dispose them therefore into order, I
shall ranke them vnder three principall colours, that is to say, Red or
Purple, White, and Yellow, and shew you the varieties of each of them
(for so many as are come to my knowledge) apart by themselues, and not
promiscuously as many others haue done.


1. _Auricula Vrsi flore purpureo._
Purple Beares eare, or The Murrey Cowslip.

This purple Beares eare or Cowslip hath many greene leaues, somewhat
long and smooth, narrow from the bottome of the leafe to the middle,
and broad from thence to the end, being round pointed, and somewhat
snipt or endented about the edges; in the middle of these leaues, and
sometimes at the sides also, doe spring round greene stalkes foure or
fiue fingers high, bearing at the top many flowers, the buds whereof,
before they are blowne, are of a very deepe purple colour, and being
open, are of a bright, but deepe purple, vsually called a Murrey
colour, consisting of fiue leaues a peece, cut in at the end as it were
into two, with a whitish ring or circle at the bottome of each flower,
standing in small greene cups, wherein after the flowers are fallen,
are contained very small heads, not rising to the height of the cups,
bearing a small pricke or pointell at the toppe of them, wherein is
little blackish seede: the roote hath many whitish strings fastened to
the maine long roote, which is very like vnto a Primrose or Cowslip
roote, as it is in all other parts besides.


2. _Auricula Vrsi purpurea absque orbe._
The murrey Cowslip without eyes.

There is another of this kinde, whose leafe is somewhat lesse, as the
flower is also, but of the same colour, and sometimes somewhat redder,
tending to a Scarlet, without any circle at the bottome of the flower,
in no other things differing from it.


3. _Auricula Vrsi minor flore tannetto._   Tawney Beares eares.

The leaues of this kinde haue a greater shew of mealinesse to be seene
in them, and not much smaller then the former, yet snipt or endented
about the ends like vnto them: the flowers are many, of the same
fashion with the former, but smaller, each whereof is of as deepe a
murrey or tawnie colour when it is blowne, as the buds of the former
are before they are blowne, hauing a white circle at the bottome of the
flower, and yellowish in the middle belowe the circle.


4. _Auricula Vrsi flore rubro saturo orbe luteo._
Deepe or bloud red Beares eares with eyes.

This kinde hath small and long greene leaues, nothing mealy, but snipt
about the edges, from the middle of the leaues forwards to the ends:
the flowers hereof are of a deepe red colour, tending to a bloud red,
with a deepe yellow circle, or rather bottome in the middle.

[Sidenote: _Auricula Vrsi flore rubro saturo absque orbe._]

There is another of this kinde, whose leaues are somewhat mealy, and
smaller then any (that I haue seene) that haue mealy leaues: the
flowers are of the same deepe red colour with the last described, yet
hath no circle or bottome of any other colour at all.


5. _Auricula Vrsi flore purpuro cæruleo._
The Violet coloured Beares eare.

We haue another, whose leaues are somewhat mealy and large; the flowers
whereof are of a paler purple then the first, somewhat tending to a
blew.


6. _Auricula Vrsi flore obsoleto magno._
The Spaniards blush Beares eare.

This great Beares eare hath as large leaues as any other of this
kindred whatsoeuer, and whitish or mealy withall, somewhat snipt
about the edges, as many other of them are: the flowers stand at the
toppe of a strong and tall stalke, larger then any of the other that
I haue seene, being of a duskie blush colour, resembling the blush of
a Spaniard, whose tawney skinne cannot declare so pure a blush as the
English can; and therefore I haue called it the Spaniards blush.


7. _Auricula Vrsi flore rubello._   Scarlet or light red Beares eares.

The leaues of this kinde are very like the leaues of the first purple
kinde, but that they are not so thicke; of a little paler greene
colour, and little or nothing snipt about the edges: the flowers are
of a bright, but pale reddish colour, not halfe so deepe as the two
last with white circles in the bottomes of them, in other things this
differeth not from others.


8. _Auricula Vrsi roseo colore._   The Rose coloured Beares eare.

We haue another, whose leafe is a little mealy, almost as large as any
of the former, whose flowers are of a light red colour, very neare the
colour of an ordinary Damaske Rose, with a white eye at the bottome.

]


9. _Auricula Vrsi flore cæruleo folio Boraginis._
Blew Beares eares with Borage leaues.

This plant is referred to the kindred or family of the Beares eares,
onely for the forme of the flower sake, which euen therein it doth not
assimilate to the halfe; but because it hath passed others with that
title, I am content to insert it here, to giue you the knowledge
thereof, and rather to satisfie others then my selfe with the place
thereof: the description whereof is as followeth: It hath diuers broad
rough hairy leaues spread vpon the ground, somewhat like vnto the
leaues of Borage for the roughnesse, but not for the largenesse; the
leaues hereof being somewhat rent in some places at the edges: from
among these leaues rise vp one, or two, or more brownish, round, and
hairy stalkes, a span high or thereabouts, bearing at the toppes three
or foure flowers a peece, consisting of fiue large pointed leaues, of a
faire blew or light azur colour, with some small yellow threads in the
middle, standing in small greene cups: the roote is long and brownish,
hauing many small fibres annexed vnto it.


10. _Auricula Vrsi maior flore albo._   The great white Beares eare.

This white Beares eare hath many faire whitish greene leaues, somewhat
paler then the leaues of any of the kindes of Beares eares, and a
little snipt about the ends, as manie other are: among these leaues
rise vp stalkes foure or fiue inches high, bearing at the toppe many
flowers like vnto the small yellow Beares eare hereafter set downe,
of a pale whitish colour, tending to yellow at the first opening of
the flower, which after two or three dayes change into a faire white
colour, and so continue all the while it flowreth: the roote is like
the purple kinde, as all or most of the rest are, or very little
differing.


11. _Auricula Vrsi minor flore albo._   The lesser white Beares eare.

The lesser Beares eare hath smaller leaues, of a little darker green
colour: the stalke and flowers are likewise lesser then the former, and
haue no shew of yellownesse at all, eyther in budde or flower, but is
pure white, differing not in other things from the rest.


12. _Auricula Vrsi maxima lutea flore eleganti._
The greatest faire yellow Beares eare with eyes.

This yellow Beares eare hath many faire large thicke leaues, somewhat
mealy or hoary vpon the greennesse, being larger then any other kinde,
except the sixth, and the next yellow that followeth, smooth about the
edges, and without any endenting at all: the stalke is great, round,
and not higher then in other of the former, but bearing manie more
flowers thereon then in any other kinde, to the number of thirty many
times, standing so round and close together, that they seeme to be a
Nosegay alone, of the same fashion with the former, but that the leaues
are shorter and rounder, yet with a notch in the middle like the rest,
of a faire yellow colour, neither very pale nor deepe, with a white
eye or circle in the bottome, about the middle of euery flower, which
giueth it the greater grace: the seede is of a blackish browne colour,
like vnto others, but contained in greater round heads then any other,
with a small pointell sticking in the middle: the roote is greater and
thicker then any other, with long strings or fibres like vnto the other
sorts, but greater.


13. _Auricula Vrsi maior lutea folio incano._
The greater yellow Beares eare.

This greater yellow Beares eare hath his leaues larger, and more mealy
or hoarie then the last, or any other of these kindes: the flowers are
not so many, but longer, and not so thicke thrusting together as the
first, but of a deeper yellow colour, without any eye or circle in the
middle.


14. _Auricula Vrsi maior flore pallido._
The great Straw coloured Beares eare.

This hath almost as mealy leaues as the last, but nothing so large;
the flowers are of a faire strawe colour, with a white circle at the
bottome of them, these three last haue no shew or shadow of any other
colour in any part of the edge, as some others that follow haue.


15. _Auricula Vrsi minor flore pallente._
The lesser straw coloured Beares eare.

We haue another, whose leafe is lesse mealy, or rather pale green,
and a little mealy withall; the flowers whereof are of a paler yellow
colour then the last, and beareth almost as many vpon a stalke as the
first great yellow.


16. _Auricula Vrsi minor lutea._   The lesser yellow Beares eares.

The leaues of this Beares eare are nothing so large as either of the
three former yellow kindes, but rather of the bignesse of the first
white kinde, but yet a little larger, thicker, and longer then it,
hauing vnder the greennesse a small shew of mealinesse, and somewhat
snipt about the edges: the flowers are of a pale yellow colour, with
a little white bottome in them: the seed and rootes are like vnto the
other kindes.


17. _Auricula Vrsi flore flauo._
The deepe yellow or Cowslip Beares eare.

This kinde hath somewhat larger leaues then the last, of a yellowish
greene colour, without any mealinesse on them, or endenting about the
edges, but smooth and whole: the flowers are not larger but longer, and
not laide open so fully as the former, but of as deepe a yellow colour
as any Cowslip almost, without any circle in the bottome: neither of
these two last haue any shew of other colour then yellow in them,
sauing the white in the eye.


18. _Auricula Vrsi versicolor prima siue flore rubescente._
The blush Beares eare.

The blush Beares eare hath his leaues as large, and as hoary or mealy
as the third greater yellow, or straw coloured Beares eare; among
which riseth vp a stalke about foure inches high, bearing from six
to twelue, or more faire flowers, somewhat larger then the smaller
yellow Beares eare before described, hauing the ground of the flower
of a darke or dunne yellow colour, shadowed ouer a little with a shew
of light purple, which therefore we call a blush colour, the edges of
the flower being tipt with a little deeper shew of that purple colour,
the bottome of the flower, abiding wholly yellow, without any circle,
and is of very great beauty, which hath caused me to place it in the
forefront of the variable coloured Beares eares. And although some
might thinke it should be placed among the first ranke of Beares eares,
because it is of a blush colour, yet seeing it is assuredly gained from
some of the yellow kindes by sowing the seede, as many other sorts are,
as may be seene plainly in the ground of the flower, which is yellow,
and but shadowed ouer with purple, yet more then any of the rest that
follow; I thinke I haue giuen it his right place: let others of skill &
experience be iudges herein.


19. _Auricula Vrsi crinis coloris._   Haire coloured Beares eares.

The leaues of this kinde are more mealy like then the last blush kinde,
but somewhat longer and larger, and snipt about the edges in the same
manner, from the middle of the leafe forwards: the flower is vsually of
a fine light browne yellow colour, which wee doe vsually call an Haire
colour, and sometimes browner, the edges of the flower haue a shew or
shadow of a light purple or blush about them, but more on the outside
then on the inside.


20. _Auricula Vrsi versicolor lutea._
The yellow variable Beares eare.

This variable Beares eare hath his greene leaues somewhat like vnto the
deepe yellow, or Cowslip Beares eare before described, but somewhat of
a fresher greene, more shining and smaller, and snipt about the edges
towards the ends, as many of those before are: the flowers are of a
faire yellow colour, much laid open when it is full blowne, that it
seemeth almost flat, dasht about the edges onely with purple, being
more yellow in the bottome of the flower, then in any other part.


21. _Auricula Vrsi versicolor lutescente viridi flore._
The variable greene Beares eare.

This kinde of Beares eare hath greene leaues, very like vnto the last
described, and snipt in the like manner about the edges, but in this
it differeth, that his leaues do turne or fold themselues a little
backwards: the flowers are of a yellowish greene colour, more closed
then the former, hauing purplish edges, especially after they haue
stood blowne some time, and haue little or none at the first opening:
these haue no circles at all in them.

Many other varieties are to be found, with those that are curious
conseruers of these delights of nature, either naturally growing on the
mountaines in seuerall places, from whence they (being searched out by
diuers) haue been taken and brought, or else raised from the seede of
some of them, as it is more probable: for seuerall varieties haue beene
obserued (and no doubt many of these before specified) to bee gotten
by sowing of the seedes, euery yeare lightly shewing a diuersity, not
obserued before, either in the leafe, diuers from that from whence it
was taken, or in the flowers. I haue onely set downe those that haue
come vnder mine owne view, and not any by relation, euen as I doe with
all or most of the things contained in this worke.


        The Place.

        Many of these goodly plants growe naturally on mountaines,
        especially the Alpes, in diuers places; for some kindes that
        growe in some places, doe not in others, but farre distant one
        from the other. There hath likewise some beene found on the
        Pyrenæan mountaines, but that kinde with the blew flower and
        Borage leafe, hath beene gathered on the mountaines in Spaine,
        and on the Pyrenæans next vnto Spaine.


        The Time.

        They all flower in Aprill and May, and the seede is ripe in
        the end of Iune, or beginning of Iuly, and sometimes they will
        flower againe in the end of Summer, or in Autumne, if the yeare
        proue temperate, moist, and rainie.


        The Names.

        It is very probable, that none of these plants were euer knowne
        vnto the ancient Writers, because we cannot be assured, that
        they may be truely referred vnto any plant that they name,
        vnlesse we beleeue Fabius Columna, that it should be _Alisma_
        of Dioscorides, for thereunto hee doth referre it. Diuers of
        the later Writers haue giuen vnto them diuers names, euery one
        according to his owne conceit. For Gesner calleth it _Lunaria
        arthritica_, and _Paralytica Alpina_. Matthiolus accounteth it
        to bee of the kindred of the Sanicles, and saith, that in his
        time it was called by diuers Herbarists, _Auricula Vrsi_, which
        name hath since bin receiued as most vsuall. We in English call
        them Beares eares, according to the Latine, or as they are
        called by diuers women, French Cowslips; they may be called
        Mountaine Cowslips, if you will, for to distinguish betweene
        them and other Cowslips, whereof these are seuerall kindes.


_Sanicula Alpina siue Cortusa Matthioli._   Beares eare Sanicle.

I cannot chuse but insert this delicate plant in the end of the Beares
eares, for that it is of so neare affinity, although it differ much in
the forme of the leaues, the description whereof is in this manner:
The leaues that spring vp first are much crumpled, and as it were
folded together, which afterwards open themselues into faire, broad,
and roundish leaues, somewhat rough or hairy, not onely cut into fine
diuisions, but somewhat notched also about the edges, of a darke
greene colour on the vpperside, and more whitish greene vnderneath;
amongst these leaues riseth vp one or two naked round stalkes, fiue or
six inches high, bearing at the toppes diuers small flowers, somewhat
sweete, like vnto the first purple Beares eare, hanging downe their
heads, consisting of fiue small pointed leaues a peece, of a darke
reddish purple colour, with a white circle or bottome in the middle,
and some small threads therein: after the flowers are past, there
come small round heads, somewhat longer then any of the Beares eares,
standing vpright vpon their small foot-stalkes, wherein is contained
small round and blackish seede: the roote consisteth of a thicke tuft
of small whitish threads, rather then rootes, much enterlaced one among
another: the leaues of this plant dye downe euery yeare, and spring vp
a new in the beginning of the yeare, whereas all the Beares eares doe
hold their leaues greene all the Winter, especially the middlemost,
which stand like a close head, the outermost for the most part
perishing after seed time.


        The Place.

        This groweth in many shadowie Woods both of Italy and Germany;
        for both Clusius hath described it, finding it in the Woods of
        Austria and Stiria; and Matthiolus setteth it downe, hauing
        receiued it from Anthonius Cortusus, who was President of
        the Garden at Padua, and found it in the woody mountaines of
        Vicenza, neare vnto Villestagna; whereon (as Matthiolus saith)
        there is found both with white flowers as well as with blew,
        but such with white flowers or blew we neuer could see or heare
        further of.


        The Time.

        It flowreth much about the time of the Beares eares; or rather
        a little later, and the seede is ripe with them.


        The Names.

        Clusius calleth it _Sanicula montana_, and _Sanicula Alpina_,
        and referreth it to the _Auricula Vrsi_, or Beares eare, which
        it doth most nearly resemble: but Matthiolus referreth it to
        the _Cariophyllata_ or _Auens_, making it to be of that tribe
        or family, and calleth it _Cortusa_ of him that first sent it
        him. Wee may call it eyther _Cortusa_, as for the most part all
        Herbarists doe, or Beares eare Sanicle as Gerrard doth.


        The Vertues.

        All the sorts of Beares eares are Cephalicall, that is,
        conducing helpe for the paines in the head, and for the
        giddinesse thereof, which may happen, eyther by the sight
        of steepe places subiect to danger, or otherwise. They are
        accounted also to be helping for the Palsey, and shaking of the
        ioynts; and also as a Sanicle or wound-herbe. The leaues of
        the _Cortusa_ taste a little hot, and if one of them bee laide
        whole, without bruising, on the cheeke of any tender skind
        woman, it will raise an orient red colour, as if some _fucus_
        had beene laide thereon, which will passe away without any
        manner of harme, or marke where it lay: This is Cortusus his
        obseruation Camerarius in his _Hortus Medicus_ saith, that an
        oyle is made thereof, that is admirable for to cure wounds.




CHAP. XXXV.

_Primula veris & Paralysis._   Primroses and Cowslips.


We haue so great variety of Primroses and Cowslips of our owne Country
breeding, that strangers being much delighted with them, haue beene
often furnished into diuers Countries, to their good content: And
that I may set them downe in some methodicall manner, as I haue done
other things, I will first set downe all the sorts of those we call
Primroses, both single and double, and afterwards the Cowslips with
their diuersities, in as ample manner as my knowledge can direct me.
And yet I know, that the name of _Primula veris_ or Primrose, is
indifferently conferred vpon those that I distinguish for _Paralyses_
or Cowslips. I doe therefore for your better vnderstanding of my
distinction betweene Primroses and Cowslips, call those onely Primroses
that carry but one flower vpon a stalke, be they single or double,
except that of Master Hesket, and that with double flowers many vpon
a stalke, set out in Gerards Herball, which is his onely, not found
(as I thinke) _in rerum natura_, I am sure, such a one I could neuer
heare of: And those Cowslips, that beare many flowers vpon a stalke
together constantly, be they single or double also. I might otherwise
distinguish them also by the leafe; that all the Primroses beare their
long and large broad yellowish greene leaues, without stalkes most
vsually; and all the Cowslips haue small stalkes vnder the leaues,
which are smaller, and of a darker greene, as vsually, but that this
distinction is neither so certaine and generall, nor so well knowne.


1. _Primula veris flore albo._   The single white Primrose.

The Primrose that groweth vnder euery bush or hedge, in all or most
of the Woods, Groues, and Orchards of this Kingdome, I may well leaue
to his wilde habitation, being not so fit for a Garden, and so well
knowne, that I meane not to giue you any further relation thereof: But
we haue a kinde hereof which is somewhat smaller, and beareth milke
white flowers, without any shew of yellownesse in them, and is more
vsually brought into Gardens for the rarity, and differeth not from the
wilde or ordinary kinde, either in roote or leafe, or any thing else,
yet hauing those yellow spots, but smaller, and not so deepe, as are in
the other wilde kinde.


2. _Primula veris flore viridi simplici._   The single greene Primrose.

The single greene Primrose hath his leaues very like vnto the greater
double Primrose, but smaller, and of a sadder greene colour: the
flowers stand seuerally vpon long foot-stalkes, as the first single
kinde doth, but larger then they, and more laide open, of the same,
or very neare the same yellowish greene colour that the huske is of,
so that at the first opening, the huske and the flower seeme to make
one double greene flower, which afterwards separating themselues, the
single flower groweth aboue the huske, and spreadeth it selfe open much
more then any other single Primrose doth, growing in the end to be of a
paler greene colour.


3. _Primula veris flore viridante & albo simplici._
The single greene and white Primrose.

The leaues of this differ in a manner nothing from the former, neither
doth the flower but only in this, that out of the large yellowish green
huskes, which contain the flowers of the former, there commeth forth
out of the middle of each of them either a small peece of a whitish
flower, or else a larger, sometimes making vp a whole flower, like an
ordinary Primrose.

        feathered Cowslip.
]


4. _Primula veris flore viridi duplici._   The double greene Primrose.

This double Primrose is in his leaues so like the former single greene
kindes, that the one cannot be knowne from the other vntill it come
to flower, and then it beareth vpon euery stalke a double green flower,
of a little deeper green colour then the flower of the former single
kinde consisting but of two rowes of short leaues most vsually, and
both of an equall height aboue the huske, abiding a pretty time in
flower, especially if it stand in any shadowed place, or where the Sun
may come but a while vnto it.


5. _Primula veris Hesketi flore multiplici separatim diviso._
Master Heskets double Primrose.

Master Heskets double Primrose is very like vnto the small double
Primrose, both in leafe, roote, and height of growing, the stalke not
rising much higher then it, but bearing flowers in a farre different
manner; for this beareth not only single flowers vpon seuerall stalkes,
but sometimes two or three single flowers vpon one stalk, and also at
the same time a bigger stalke, and somewhat higher, hauing one greene
huske at the toppe thereof, sometimes broken on the one side, and
sometimes whole, in the middle whereof standeth sometimes diuers single
flowers, thrust together, euery flower to be seene in his proper forme,
and sometimes there appeare with some whole flowers others that are but
parts of flowers, as if the flowers were broken in peeces, and thrust
into one huske, the leaues of the flowers (being of a white or pale
Primrose Colour, but a little deeper) seldome rising aboue the height
of the very huske it selfe; and sometimes, as I haue obserued in this
plant, it will haue vpon the same stalke, that beareth such flowers
as I haue here described vnto you, a small flower or two, making the
stalke seeme branched into many flowers, whereby you may perceiue, that
it will vary into many formes, not abiding constant in any yeare, as
all the other sorts doe.


6. _Primula hortensis flore pleno vulgaris._
The ordinary double Primrose.

The leaues of this Primrose are very large, and like vnto the single
kind, but somewhat larger, because it growth in gardens: the flowers
doe stand euery one seuerally vpon slender long footestalkes, as the
single kinde doth, in greenish huskes of a pale yellow colour, like
vnto the field Primrose, but very thicke and double, and of the same
sweete sent with them.


7. _Primula veris flore duplici._   The small double Primrose.

This Primrose is both in leafe, roote, and flower, altogether like
vnto the last double Primrose, but that it is smaller in all things;
for the flower riseth not aboue two or three fingers high, and but
twice double, that is, with two rowes of leaues, yet of the very same
Primrose colour that the former is of.


8. _Paralysis vulgaris pratensis flore flauo simplici odorato._
The Common field Cowslip.

The common fielde Cowslip I might well forbeare to set downe, being
so plentifull in the fields: but because many take delight in it, and
plant it in their gardens, I will giue you the description of it here.
It hath diuers green leaues, very like vnto the wilde Primrose, but
shorter, rounder, stiffer, rougher, more crumpled about the edges, and
of a sadder greene colour, euery one standing vpon his stalke, which
is an inch or two long: among the leaues rise vp diuers round stalkes,
a foote or more high, bearing at the toppe many faire yellow single
flowers, with spots of a deeper yellow, at the bottome of each leafe,
smelling very sweete. The rootes are like to the other Primroses,
hauing many fibres annexed to the great roote.


9. _Paralysis altera odorata flore pallido polyanthos._
The Primrose Cowslip.

The leaues of this Cowslip are larger then the ordinary fielde Cowslip,
and of a darke yellowish greene colour; the flowers are many, standing
together, vpon the toppes of the stalkes, to the number of thirty
sometimes vpon one stalke, as I haue counted them in mine owne Garden,
and sometimes more, euery one hauing a longer foote stalke then
the former, and of as pale a yellowish colour almost as the fielde
Primrose, with yellow spots at the bottome of the leaues, as the
ordinary hath, and of as sweet a sent.


10. _Paralysis flore viridante simplici._   The single greene Cowslip.

There is little difference in leafe or roote of this from the first
Cowslip, the chiefest varietie in this kinde is this, that the leaues
are somewhat greener, and the flowers being in all respects like in
forme vnto the first kinde, but somewhat larger, are of the same colour
with the greene huskes, or rather a little yellower, and of a very
small sent; in all other things I finde no diuersitie, but that it
standeth much longer in flower before it fadeth, especially if it stand
out of the Sunne.


11. _Paralysis flore & calice crispo._
Curl’d Cowslips or Gallegaskins.

There is another kinde, whose flowers are folded or crumpled at the
edges, and the huskes of the flowers bigger than any of the former,
more swelling out in the middle, as it were ribbes, and crumpled on the
sides of the huskes, which doe somewhat resemble mens hose that they
did weare, and tooke the name of Gallegaskins from thence.


12. _Paralysis flore geminato odorato._
Double Cowslips one within another, or Hose in Hose.

The only difference of this kinde from the ordinary field Cowslip is,
that it beareth one single flower out of another, which is as a greene
huske, of the like sent that the first hath, or somewhat weaker.


13. _Paralysis flore flauo simplici inodoro absque calicibus._
Single Oxe lippes.

This kinde of Cowslip hath leaues much like the ordinary kinde, but
somewhat smaller: the flowers are yellow like the Cowslip, but smaller,
standing many vpon a stalke, but bare or naked, that is, without any
huske to containe them, hauing but little or no sent at all; not
differing in any thing else from the ordinary Cowslip.


14. _Paralysis flore geminato inodora._   Double Oxelips Hose in Hose.

As the former double Cowslip had his flowers one within another, in the
very like manner hath this kinde of Cowslip or Oxelippe, sauing that
this hath no huske to containe them, no more then the former single
Oxelippe hath, standing bare or naked, of the very same bignesse each
of them, and of the same deepe yellow colour with it, hauing as small a
sent as the former likewise.

[Sidenote: _Flore pallidiora._]

Wee haue another of this kinde, whose leaues are somewhat larger, and
so are the flowers also, but of a paler yellow colour.


15. _Paralysis inodora calicibus dissectis._
Oxelips with iagged huskes.

This kinde differeth not from the first Oxelip in the smalnesse of the
greene leaues, but in the flower, which standing many together on a
reasonable high stalke, and being very small and yellow, scarce opening
themselues or layde abroade as it, hath a greene huske vnder each
flower, but diuided into sixe seuerall small long peeces.


16. _Paralysis flore fatuo._
The Franticke, or Foolish Cowslip: Or Iacke an apes on horse backe.

Wee haue in our gardens another kinde, not much differing in leaues
from the former Cowslip, and is called Fantasticke or Foolish, because
it beareth at the toppe of the stalke a bush or tuft of small long
greene leaues, with some yellow leaues, as it were peeces of flowers
broken, and standing among the greene leaues. And sometimes some
stalkes among those greene leaues at the toppe (which are a little
larger then when it hath but broken peeces of flowers) doe carry whole
flowers in huskes like the single kinde.


17. _Paralysis minor flore rubro._   Red Birds eyes.

This little Cowslippe (which will hardly endure in our gardens, for
all the care and industrie we can vse to keepe it) hath all the
Winter long, and vntill the Spring begin to come on, his leaues so
closed together, that it seemeth a small white head of leaues, which
afterwards opening it selfe, spreadeth round vpon the ground, and
hath small long and narrow leaues, snipt about the edges, of a pale
greene colour on the vpperside, & very white or mealy vnderneath,
among these leaues rise vp one or two stalks, small & hoary, halfe a
foot high, bearing at the top a bush or tuft of much smaller flowers,
standing vpon short foot stalkes, somewhat like vnto Cowslips, but more
like vnto the Beares eares, of a fine reddish purple colour, in some
deeper, in others paler, with a yellowish circle in the bottomes of the
flowers, like vnto many of the Beares eares, of a faint or small sent:
the seede is smaller than in any of the former kindes, and so are the
rootes likewise, being small, white and threddy.


18. _Paralysis minor flore albo._   White Birds eyes.

This kinde differeth very little or nothing from the former, sauing
that it seemeth a little larger both in leafe and flower, and that the
flowers hereof are wholly white, without any great appearance of any
circle in the bottome of them, vnlesse it be well obserued, or at least
being nothing so conspicuous, as in the former.

[Sidenote: _Flore geminato._]

These two kindes haue sometimes, but very seldome, from among the
middle of the flowers on the stalke, sent out another small stalke,
bearing flowers thereon likewise.


19. _Paralysis hortensis flore pleno._   Double Paigles or Cowslips.

The double Paigle or Cowslip hath smaller and darker greene leaues
then the single kinde hath, and longer stalkes also whereon the leaues
doe stand: it beareth diuers flowers vpon a stalke, but not so many as
the single kinde, euery one whereof is of a deeper and fairer yellow
colour then any of the former, standing not much aboue the brimmes of
the huskes that hold them, consisting of two or three rowes of leaues
set round together, which maketh it shew very thicke and double, of a
prettie small sent, but not heady.


20. _Paralysis flore viridante pleno._   Double greene Cowslips.

This double greene Cowslip is so like vnto the single greene kinde
formerly expressed, that vntill they be neare flowring, they can hardly
be distinguished; but when it is in flower, it hath large double
flowers, of the same yellowish greene colour with the single, and more
laid open then the former double Paigle.


21. _Paralysis flore viridante siue calamistrato._
The greene Rose Cowslip, or double greene feathered Cowslip.

There is small difference in the leaues of this double kinde from
the last, but that they are not of so darke a greene: the chiefest
difference consisteth in the flowers, which are many, standing together
at the toppes of the stalkes, but farre differing from all other of
these kindes: for euery flower standing vpon his owne stalke, is
composed of many very small and narrow leaues, without any huske
to containe them, but spreading open like a little Rose, of a pale
yellowish greene colour, and without any sent at all, abiding in
flower, especially if it stand in a shadowie place out of the sunne,
aboue two moneths, almost in as perfect beauty, as in the first weeke.


        The Place.

        All those kindes as they haue been found wilde, growing in
        diuers places in England, so they haue been transplanted into
        Gardens, to be there nourished for the delight of their louers,
        where they all abide, and grow fairer then in their naturall
        places, except the small Birds eyes, which will (as I said)
        hardly abide any culture, but groweth plentifully in all the
        North Countries, in their squally or wet grounds.


        The Time.

        These doe all flower in the Spring of the yeare, some earlier
        and some later, and some in the midst of Winter, as they are
        defended from the colds and frosts, and the mildnesse of the
        time will permit; yet the Cowslips doe alwayes flower later
        then the Primroses, and both the single and double greene
        Cowslips latest, as I said in their descriptions, and abide
        much after all the rest.


        The Names.

        All these plants are called most vsually in Latine, _Primulæ
        veris_, _Primulæ pratenses_, and _Primulæ siluarum_, because
        they shew by their flowring the new Spring to bee comming on,
        they being as it were the first Embassadours thereof. They haue
        also diuers other names, as _Herba Paralysis_, _Arthritica_,
        _Herba Sancti Petri_, _Claues Sancti Petri_, _Verbasculum
        odoratum_, _Lunaria arthritica_, _Phlomis_, _Alisma siluarum_,
        and _Alismatis alterum genus_, as Fabius Columna calleth them.
        The Birds eyes are called of Lobel in Latine, _Paralytica
        Alpina_, _Sanicula angustifolia_, making a greater and a
        lesser. Others call them _Sanicula angustifolia_, but generally
        they are called _Primula veris minor_. I haue (as you see)
        placed them with the Cowslips, putting a difference betweene
        Primroses and Cowslips. And some haue distinguished them,
        by calling the Cowslips, _Primula veris Elatior_, that is,
        the Taller Primrose, and the other _Humilis_, Lowe or Dwarfe
        Primroses. In English they haue in like manner diuers names,
        according to seuerall Countries, as Primroses, Cowslips,
        Oxelips, Palsieworts, and Petty Mulleins. The first kindes,
        which are lower then the rest, are generally called by the name
        of Primroses (as I thinke) throughout England. The others are
        diuersly named; for in some Countries they call them Paigles
        or Palsieworts, or Petty Mulleins, which are called Cowslips
        in others. Those are vsually called Oxelips, whose flowers are
        naked, or bare without huskes to containe them, being not so
        sweete as the Cowslip, yet haue they some little sent, although
        the Latine name doth make them to haue none. The Franticke,
        Fantasticke, or Foolish Cowslip, in some places is called by
        Country people, Iacke an Apes on horse-backe, which is an
        vsuall name with them, giuen to many other plants, as Daisies,
        Marigolds, &c. if they be strange or fantasticall, differing
        in the forme from the ordinary kinde of the single ones. The
        smallest are vsually called through all the North Country,
        Birds eyen, because of the small yellow circle in the bottomes
        of the flowers, resembling the eye of a bird.


        The Vertues.

        Primroses and Cowslips are in a manner wholly vsed in
        Cephalicall diseases, either among other herbes or flowers,
        or of themselues alone, to ease paines in the head, and
        is accounted next vnto Betony, the best for that purpose.
        Experience likewise hath shewed that they are profitable
        both for the Palsie, and paines of the ioynts, euen as the
        Beares eares are, which hath caused the name of _Arthritica_,
        _Paralysis_, and _Paralytica_ to bee giuen them. The iuice of
        the flowers is commended to cleanse the spots or marks of the
        face, whereof some Gentlewomen haue found good experience.




CHAP. XXXVI.

_Pulmonaria._   Lungwort, or Cowslips of Ierusalem.


Although these plants are generally more vsed as Pot-herbes for the
Kitchen, then as flowers for delight, yet because they are both called
Cowslips, and are of like forme, but of much lesse beauty, I haue
ioyned them next vnto them, in a distinct Chapter by themselues, and so
may passe at this time.


1. _Pulmonaria maculosa._   Common spotted Cowslips of Ierusalem.

The Cowslip of Ierusalem hath many rough, large, and round leaues, but
pointed at the ends, standing vpon long foot-stalkes, spotted with many
round white spots on the vppersides of the sad greene or browne leaues,
and of a grayer greene vnderneath: among the leaues spring vp diuers
browne stalkes, a foote high, bearing many flowers at the toppe, very
neare resembling the flowers of Cowslips, being of a purple or reddish
colour while they are buds, and of a darke blewish colour when they
are blowne, standing in brownish greene huskes, and sometimes it hath
beene found with white flowers: when the flowers are past, there come
vp small round heads, containing blacke seed: the roote is composed of
many long and thicke blacke strings.


2. _Pulmonaria altera non maculosa._   Vnspotted Cowslips of Ierusalem.

The leaues of this other kinde are not much vnlike the former, being
rough as they are, but smaller, of a fairer greene colour aboue, and of
a whiter greene vnderneath, without any spots at all vpon the leaues:
the flowers also are like the former, and of the same colour, but a
little more branched vpon the stalkes then the former: the rootes also
are blacke like vnto them.


3. _Pulmonaria angustifolia._   Narrow leafed Cowslips of Ierusalem.

The leaues hereof are somewhat longer, but not so broad, and spotted
with whitish spots also as the former: the stalke hereof is set with
the like long hairy leaues, but smaller, being a foote high or better,
bearing at the toppe many flowers, standing in huskes like the first,
being somewhat reddish in the bud, and of a darke purplish blew colour
when they are blowne open: the seede is like the former, all of them
doe well resemble Buglosse and Comfrey in most parts, except the roote,
which is not like them, but stringie, like vnto Cowslips, yet blacke.


        The Place.

        The Cowslips of Ierusalem grow naturally in the Woods of
        Germany, in diuers places, and the first kinde in England
        also, found out by Iohn Goodier, a great searcher and louer of
        plants, dwelling at Maple-durham in Hampshire.


        The Time.

        They flower for the most part very early, that is, in the
        beginning of Aprill.


        The Names.

        They are generally called in Latine, _Pulmonaria_, and
        _maculosa_, or _non maculosa_, is added for distinctions sake.
        Of some it is called _Symphitum maculosum_, that is, spotted
        Comfrey. In English it is diuersly called, as spotted Cowslips
        of Ierusalem, Sage of Ierusalem, Sage of Bethlehem, Lungwort,
        and spotted Comfrey, and it might bee as fitly called spotted
        Buglosse, whereunto it is as like as vnto Comfrey, as I said
        before.


        The Vertues.

        It is much commended of some, to bee singular good for vlcered
        lungs, that are full of rotten matter. As also for them that
        spit bloud, being boyled and drunke. It is of greatest vse for
        the pot, being generally held to be good, both for the lungs
        and the heart.




CHAP. XXXVII.

1. _Buglossum & Borrago._   Buglosse and Borage.


Although Borage and Buglosse might as fitly haue been placed, I
confesse, in the Kitchen Garden, in regard they are wholly in a manner
spent for Physicall properties, or for the Pot, yet because anciently
they haue been entertained into Gardens of pleasure, their flowers
hauing been in some respect; in that they haue alwaies been enterposed
among the flowers of womens needle-worke, I am more willing to giue
them place here, then thrust them into obscurity, and take such of
their tribe with them also as may fit for this place, either for beauty
or rarity.

The Garden Buglosse and Borage are so well knowne vnto all, that I
shall (I doubt) but spend time in waste to describe them; yet not
vsing to passe ouer any thing I name and appropriate to this Garden
so sleightly, they are thus to bee knowne: Buglosse hath many long,
narrow, hairy, or rough sad greene leaues, among which rise vp two
or three very high stalks, branched at the top, whereon stand many
blew flowers, consisting of fiue small round pointed leaues, with a
small pointell in the middle, which are very smooth, shining, and of a
reddish purple while they are buds, and not blowne open, which being
fallen, there groweth in the greene huske, wherein the flower stood,
three or foure roundish blacke seedes, hauing that thread or pointell
standing still in the middle of them: the roote is blacke without, and
whitish within, long, thicke, and full of slimie iuice (as the leaues
are also) and perisheth not euery yeare, as the roote of Borage doth.


2. _Borrago._   Borage.

Borage hath broader, shorter, greener, and rougher leaues then
Buglosse, the stalkes hereof are not so high, but branched into many
parts, whereon stand larger flowers, and more pointed at the end then
Buglosse, and of a paler blew colour for the most part (yet sometimes
the flowers are reddish, and sometimes pure white) each of the flowers
consisting of fiue leaues, standing in a round hairy whitish huske,
diuided into fiue parts, and haue a small vmbone of fiue blackish
threads in the middle, standing out pointed at the end, and broad
at the bottome: the seed is like the other: the root is thicker and
shorter then the roote of Buglosse, somewhat blackish without also, and
whitish within, and perisheth after seede time, but riseth of it owne
seede fallen, and springeth in the beginning of the yeare.


3. _Borrago semper virens._   Euerliuing Borage.

Euerliuing Borage hath many broad greene leaues, and somewhat rough,
more resembling Comfrey then Borage, yet not so large as either; the
stalkes are not so high as Borage, and haue many small blew flowers on
them, very like to the flowers of Buglosse for the forme, and Borage
for the colour; the rootes are blacke, thicker then either of them,
somewhat more spreading, and not perishing, hauing greene leaues all
the Winter long, and thereupon tooke his name.


4. _Anchusa._   Sea Buglosse or Alkanet.

The Sea Buglosse or Alkanet hath many long, rough, narrow, and darke
greene leaues, spread vpon the ground (yet some that growe by the
Sea side are rather hoarie and whitish) among these leaues riseth vp
a stalke, spread at the toppe into many branches, whereon stand the
flowers in tufts, like vnto the Garden Buglosse, or rather Comfrey, but
lesser; in some plants of a reddish blew colour, and in others more red
or purplish, and in others of a yellowish colour: after which come the
seedes, very like vnto Buglosse, but somewhat longer and paler: the
roote of most of them being transplanted, are somewhat blackish on the
outside, vntill the later end of Summer, and then become more red: for
those that grow wilde, will be then so red, that they will giue a very
deepe red colour to those that handle them, which being dryed keepe
that red colour, which is vsed to many purposes; the roote within being
white, and hauing no red colour at all.


5. _Limonium Rauwolfij._   Marsh Buglosse.

This Limonium (which I referre here to the kindes of Buglosse,
presuming it is the fittest place where to insert it) hath many long
narrow, and somewhat rough leaues lying vpon the ground, waued or
cut in on both sides, like an Indenture, somewhat like the leaues
of Ceterach or Miltwast, among which rise vp two or three stalkes,
somewhat rough also, and with thin skinnes like wings, indented on both
sides thereof also, like the leaues, hauing three small, long, rough,
and three square leaues at euery ioynt, where it brancheth forth; at
the toppe whereof stand many flowers vpon their foote stalkes, in such
a manner, as is not seene in any other plant, that I know; for although
that some of the small winged foot stalkes are shorter, and some
longer, standing as it were flatwise, or all on one side, and not round
like an vmbell, yet are they euen at the toppe, and not one higher than
another; each of which small foote stalkes doe beare foure or fiue
greenish heads or huskes, ioyned together, out of each of which doe
arise other pale or bleake blew stiffe huskes, as if they were flowers,
made as it were of parchment, which hold their colour after they
are dry a long time; and out of these huskes likewise, doe come (at
seuerall times one after another, and not all at one time or together)
white flowers, consisting of fiue small round leaues, with some white
threds in the middle: after these flowers are past, there come in their
places small long seede, inclosed in many huskes, many of those heads
being idle, not yeelding any goode seede, but chaffe, especially in out
Countrey, for the want of sufficient heate of the Sunne, as I take it:
the roote is small, long, and blackish on the outside, and perisheth at
the first approach of Winter.


        The Place.

        Borage and Buglosse grow onely in Gardens with vs, and so doth
        the _Semper virens_, his originall being vnknowne vnto vs.
        Alkanet or Sea Buglosse groweth neare the Sea, in many places
        of France, and Spaine, and some of the kindes also in England.
        But the Limonium or Marshe Buglosse groweth in Cales, and
        Malacca in Spaine, and is found also in Syria, as Rauwolfius
        relateth: and in other places also no doubt; for it hath beene
        sent vs out of Italie, many yeares before eyther Guillaume Boel
        found it in Cales, or Clusius in Malacca.


        The Time.

        Borage and Buglosse doe flower in Iune, and Iuly, and sometimes
        sooner, and so doth the euer-liuing or neuer-dying Borage, but
        not as Gerrard saith, flowring Winter and Summer, whereupon
        it should take his name, but leaueth flowring in Autumne, and
        abideth greene with his leaues all the Winter, flowring the
        next Spring following. The other flower not vntill Iuly, and so
        continue, especially the Marshe Buglosse vntill September bee
        well spent, and then giueth seede, if early frosts ouertake it
        not; for it seldome commeth to be ripe.

]


        The Names.

        Our ordinary Borage by the consent of all the best moderne
        Writers, is the true _Buglossum_ of Dioscorides, and that our
        Buglosse was vnknowne to the ancients. The _Borago semper
        virens_, Lobel calleth _Buglossum semper virens_, that is,
        Euer-liuing, or Greene Buglosse: but it more resembleth Borage
        then Buglosse; yet because Buglosse abideth greene, to auoyde
        that there should not be two _Buglossa semper virentia_, I
        had rather call it Borage then Buglosse. Anchusa hath diuers
        names, as Dioscorides setteth downe. And some doe call it
        _Fucus herba_, from the Greeke word, because the roote giuing
        so deepe a colour, was vsed to dye or paint the skinne. Others
        call it _Buglossum Hispanicum_, in English Alkanet, and of some
        Orchanet, after the French. Limonium was found by Leonhartus
        Rauwolfius, neere vnto Ioppa, which he setteth downe in the
        second Chapter of the third booke of his trauayles, and from
        him first knowne to these parts: I haue, as you see, referred
        it to the kindes of Buglosse, for that the flowers haue some
        resemblance vnto them, although I know that _Limonium genuinum_
        is referred to the Beetes. Let it therefore here finde a place
        of residence, vntill you or I can finde a fitter; and call it
        as you thinke best, eyther Limonium as Rauwolfius doth, or
        Marshe Buglosse as I doe, or if you can adde a more proper
        name, I shall not be offended.


        The Vertues.

        Borage and Buglosse are held to bee both temperate herbes,
        beeing vsed both in the pot and in drinkes that are cordiall,
        especially the flowers, which of Gentlewomen are candid for
        comfitts. The Alkanet is drying, and held to be good for
        wounds, and if a peece of the roote be put into a little oyle
        of Peter or Petroleum, it giueth as deepe a colour to the oyle,
        as the Hypericon doth or can to his oyle, and accounted to be
        singular good for a cut or greene wound.

        The Limonium hath no vse that wee know, more then for a Garden;
        yet as Rauwolfius saith, the Syrians vse the leaues as sallats
        at the Table.




CHAP. XXXVIII.

_Lychnis._   Campions.


There bee diuers sorts of Campions, as well tame as wilde, and although
some of them that I shall here entreate of, may peraduenture be found
wilde in our owne Countrey, yet in regard of their beautifull flowers,
they are to bee respected, and noursed vp with the rest, to furnish
a garden of pleasure; as for the wilde kindes, I will leaue them for
another discourse.


1. _Lychnis Coronaria rubra simplex._   The single red Rose Campion.

The single red Rose Campion hath diuers thicke, hoary, or woolly long
greene leaues, abiding greene all the winter, and in the end of the
spring or beginning of summer, shooteth forth two or three hard round
woolly stalkes, with some ioynts thereon, and at euery ioynt two such
like hoary greene leaues as those below, but smaller, diuersly branched
at the toppe, hauing one flower vpon each seuerall long foot stalke,
consisting of fiue leaues, somewhat broade and round pointed, of a
perfect red crimson colour, standing out of a hard long round huske,
ridged or crested in foure or fiue places; after the flowers are fallen
there come vp round hard heads, wherein is contained small blackish
seed: the roote is small, long and wooddy, with many fibres annexed
vnto it, and shooteth forth anew oftentimes, yet perisheth often also.


2. _Lychnis Coronaria alba simplex._   The white Rose Campion.

The white Rose Campion is in all things like the red, but in the colour
of the flower, which in this is of a pure white colour.


3. _Lychnis Coronaria albescens siue incarnata maculata & non
maculata._   The blush Rose Campion spotted and not spotted.

Like vnto the former also are these other sorts, hauing no other
difference to distinguish them, but the flowers, which are of a pale or
bleake whitish blush colour, especially about the brims, as if a very
little red were mixed with a great deale of white, the middle of the
flower being more white; the one being spotted all ouer the flower,
with small spots and streakes, the other not hauing any spot at all.


4. _Lychnis Coronaria rubra multiplex._   The double red Rose Campion.

The double red Rose Campion is in all respects like vnto the single red
kinde, but that this beareth double flowers, consisting of two or three
rowes of leaues at the most, which are not so large as the single, and
the whole plant is more tender, that is, more apt to perish, then any
of the single kindes.


5. _Lychnis Chalcedonica flore simplici miniato._
Single Nonesuch, or Flower of Bristow, or Constantinople.

This Campion of Constantinople hath many broad and long greene leaues,
among which rise vp sundry stiffe round hairy ioynted stalks three foot
high, with two leaues euery ioynt: the flowers stand at the toppes of
them, very many together, in a large tuft or vmbell, consisting of fiue
small long leaues, broade pointed, and notched-in in the middle, of a
bright red orenge colour, which being past, there come in their places
small hard whitish heads or seede vessels, containing blacke seede,
like vnto the seede of sweet Williams, and hauing but a small sent; the
roote is very stringie, fastening it selfe very strongly in the ground,
whereby it is much encreased.

[Sidenote: _Flore albo. Et carneo. Versicolor._]

Of the single kinde there is also two or three other sorts, differing
chiefly in the colour of the flowers. The one is pure white. Another
is of a blush colour wholly, without variation. And a third is very
variable; for at the first it is of a pale red, and after a while
groweth paler, vntill in the end it become almost fully white; and all
these diuersities of the flowers are sometimes to bee seene on one
stalke at one and the same time.


6. _Lychnis Chalcedonica flore miniato pleno._
Double Flower of Bristow, or Nonesuch.

This glorious flower being as rare as it is beautifull, is for rootes
beeing stringie, for leaues and stalkes being hairy and high, and for
the flowers growing in tufts, altogether like the first single kinde;
but herein consisteth the chiefest difference, that this beareth a
larger vmbell or tuft of flowers at the toppe of the stalke, euery
flower consisting of three or foure rowes of leaues, of a deeper orenge
colour then it, which addeth the more grace vnto it, but passeth
away without bearing seede, as most other double flowers doe, yet
recompenceth that defect with encrease from the roote.


7. _Lychnis plumaria siluestris simplex & multiplex._
The featherd wilde Campion single and double.

The leaues of this wilde Campion are somewhat like the ordinary white
wilde Campion, but not so large, or rather resembling the leaues of
sweete Williams, but that they grow not so close, nor so many together:
the stalkes haue smaller leaues at the ioynts then those belowe, and
branched at the toppe, with many pale, but bright red flowers, iagged
or cut in on the edges, like the feathered Pinke, whereof some haue
taken it to be a kinde, and some for a kinde of wilde William, but yet
is but a wilde Campion, as may be obserued, both by his huske that
beareth the flowers, and by the greyish roundish seede, being not of
the Family of Pinkes and Gillowers, but (as I said) of the Campions:
the roote is full of strings or fibres.

[Sidenote: _Flore pleno._]

The double kinde is very like vnto the single kinde, but that it is
lower and smaller, and the flowers very double.


8. _Lychnis siluestris flore pleno rubro._   Red Batchelours buttons.

The double wilde Campion (which of our Countrey Gentlewomen is called
Batchelours buttons) is very like both in rootes, leaues, stalkes, and
flowers vnto the ordinary wilde red Campion, but somewhat lesser, his
flowers are not iagged, but smooth, and very thicke and double, so that
most commonly it breaketh his short huske, wherein the flower standeth
on the one side, seldome hauing a whole huske, and are of a reddish
colour.


9. _Lychnis siluestris flore albo pleno._   White Batchelours buttons.

As the leaues of the former double Campion was like vnto the single
kinde that had red flowers, so this hath his leaues like vnto the
single white kinde, differing in no other thing from it, but in the
doublenesse of the flowers, which by reason of the multiplicity of
leaues in them thrusting forth together, breaketh his huskes wherein
the flowers doe stand, as the other doth, and hath scarce one flower in
many that is whole.


10. _Ocymoides arborea semper virens._   Strange Bassil Campion.

This Strange Campion (for thereunto it must bee referred) shooteth
forth many round, whitish, wooddy, but brittle stalkes, whereon stand
diuers long, and somewhat thicke leaues, set by couples, narrow at
the bottome, and broader toward the point, of a very faire greene and
shining colour, so that there is more beauty in the greene leaues,
which doe so alwaies abide, then in the flowers, which are of a pale
red or blush colour, consisting of fiue small long broad pointed
leaues, notched in the middle, which doe not lye close, but loosly as
it were hanging ouer the huskes: after the flowers are past, there come
heads that containe blackish seede: the roote is small, hard, white,
and threadie.


11. _Muscipula Lobelij siue Ben rubrum Monspeliensium._
Lobels Catch Flie.

I must needes insert this small plant, to finish this part of the
Campions, whereunto it belongeth, being a pretty toye to furnish and
decke out a Garden. It springeth vp (if it haue beene once sowne and
suffered to shed) in the later end of the yeare most commonly, or else
in the Spring with fiue or six small leaues, very like vnto the leaues
of Pinkes, and of the same grayish colour, but a little broader and
shorter, and when it beginneth to shoote vp for flower, it beareth
smaller leaues on the clammy or viscous stalkes (fit to hold any small
thing that lighteth on it); being broad at the bottome compassing them,
and standing two at a ioynt one against another: the toppes of the
stalkes are diuersly branched into seuerall parts, euery branch hauing
diuers small red flowers, not notched, but smooth, standing out of
small, long, round, stript huskes, which after the flowers are past,
containe small grayish seede: the roote is small, and perisheth after
it hath giuen seede; but riseth (as is before said) of its owne seede,
if it be suffered to shed.

        The Place.

        The Rose Campions, Flowers of Bristow, or Nonesuch, the Bassil
        Campion, and the Catch Flie, haue been sent vs from beyond
        the Seas, and are onely noursed vp in Gardens with vs; the
        other Campions that are double, haue been naturally so found
        double wilde (for no art or industry of man, that euer I could
        be assured of to be true, be it by neuer so many repetitions of
        transplantations, and planeticall obseruations (as I haue said
        in the beginning of this worke) could bring any flower, single
        by nature, to become double, notwithstanding many affirmations
        to that purpose, but whatsoeuer hath been found wilde to be
        double, nature her selfe, and not art hath so produced it) and
        being brought into Gardens, are there encreased by slipping,
        and parting the roote, because they giue no seede.


        The Time.

        All of them doe flower in the Summer, yet none before May.


        The Names.

        The first kindes are called _Lychnides satiuæ_, and
        _coronariæ_, in English generally Rose Campions. The next is
        called _Lychnis Chalcedonica_, and _Byzantina_; in English,
        of some Nonesuch, and of others Flower of Bristow, and after
        the Latine, Flower of Constantinople, because it is thought
        the seede was first brought from thence; but from whence the
        double of this kinde came, we cannot tell. The names of the
        others of this kinde, both single and double, are set downe
        with their descriptions. The feathered Campions are called
        _Armoraria pratensis_, and _Flos Cuculi_, and of Clusius and
        others thought to be _Odontitis Plinij_. Some call them in
        English Crowflowers, and Cuckowe-Flowers; and some call the
        double hereof, The faire Maide of France. The Bassil Campions
        were sent ouer among many other seedes out of Italy, by the
        name of _Ocimoides arborea semper virens_. _Arborea_, because
        the stalke is more wooddy and durable then other Campions: And
        _semper virens_, because the leaues abide greene Winter and
        Summer. Clusius calleth it _Lychnis semper virens_, because
        it is certainly a Campion. The last is diuersly called of
        Authors; Lobel calleth it _Muscipula_: Others _Armoraria
        altera_: Dodonæus _Armerius flos quartus_. Clusius _Lychnis
        siluestris altera_, in his Spanish obseruations, and _prima_
        in his History of plants, and saith, the learned of Salmantica
        in Spaine called it, _Ben rubrum_, as Lobel saith, they of
        Mompelier doe also: and by that name I receiued it first out
        of Italy. It hath the name of Catch Flie, of _Muscipula_ the
        Latine word, because the stalkes in the hot Summer dayes haue a
        certaine viscous or clammy humour vpon them, whereby it easily
        holdeth (as I said before) whatsoeuer small thing, as Flies,
        &c. lighteth vpon it.


        The Vertues.

        We know none in these dayes, that putteth any of these to any
        Physicall vse, although some haue in former times.




CHAP. XXXIX.


_Keiri siue Leucoium luteum._   Wall-flowers, or Wall Gilloflowers.

There are two sorts of Wall-flowers, the one single, the other double,
and of each of them there is likewise some differences, as shall be
shewed in their description.


1. _Keiri siue Leucoium luteum simplex vulgare._
Common single Wall-flowers.

The common single Wall-flower which groweth wilde abroad, and yet is
brought into Gardens, hath sundry small, narrow, long, and darke greene
leaues, set without order vpon small round whitish wooddy stalkes,
which beare at the tops diuers single yellow flowers one aboue another,
euery one hauing foure leaues a peece, and of a very sweete sent: after
which come long pods, containing reddish seede: the roote is white,
hard and thready.


2. _Keiri siue Leucoium luteum simplex maius._
The great single Wall-flower.

There is another sort of single Wall-flower, whose leaues as well as
flowers are much larger then the former: the leaues being of a darker
and shining greene colour, and the flowers of a very deepe gold yellow
colour, and vsually broader then a twentie shilling peece of gold can
couer: the spike or toppe of flowers also much longer, and abiding
longer in flower, and much sweeter likewise in sent: the pods for seede
are thicker and shorter, with a small point at the end: this is slower
to encrease into branches, as also to be encreased by the branches,
and more tender to be preserued; for the hard frosts doe cause it to
perish, if it be not defended from them.


3. _Keiri simplex flore albo._   White Wall-flower.

This Wall-flower hath his leaues as greene as the great kinde, but
nothing so large: the flowers stand at the toppe, but not in so long
a spike, and consisteth of foure leaues, of a very white colour, not
much larger then the common kinde, and of a faint or weaker sent: the
pods are nothing so great as the former great one: this is more easie
to be propagated and encreased also, but yet will require some care in
defending it from the colds of the Winter.


4. _Keiri siue Leucoium luteum vulgare flore pleno._
Common double Wall-flowers.

This ordinary double Wall-flower is in leaues and stalke very like vnto
the first single kinde, but that the leaues hereof are not of so deepe
a greene colour: the flowers stand at the top of the stalkes one aboue
another, as it were a long spike, which flower by degrees, the lowest
first, and so vpwards, by which it is a long time in flowring, and is
very double, of a gold yellow colour, and very sweete.


5. _Keiri siue Leucoium luteum alterum flore pleno._
Pale double Wall-flowers.

Wee haue another sort of this kinde of double Wall-flower, whose double
flowers stand not spike-fashion as the former, but more open spread,
and doe all of them blowe open at one time almost, and not by degrees
as the other doth, and is of a paler yellow colour, not differing in
any thing else, except that the greene leaues hereof are of a little
paler greene then it.


6. _Keiri siue Leucoium luteum maius flore pleno ferrugineo._
Double red Wall-flowers.

We haue also another sort of double Wall-flower, whose leaues are as
greene, and almost as large as the great single yellow kinde, or full
as bigge as the leaues of the white Wall-flower: the flowers hereof are
not much larger then the ordinary, but are of a darker yellow colour
then the great single kinde, and of a more brownish or red colour on
the vnderside of the leaues, and is as it were striped.


7. _Keiri siue Leucoium maximum luteum flore pleno._
The greatest double yellow Wall-flower.

This great double Wall-flower is as yet a stranger in England, and
therefore what I here write is more vpon relation (which yet I beleeue
to be most true) then vpon sight and speculation. The leaues of this
Wall-flower are as greene and as large, if not larger then the great
single kinde: the flowers also are of the same deepe gold yellow colour
with it, but much larger then any of the former double kindes, and of
as sweet a sent as any, which addeth delight vnto beauty.


        The Place.

        The first single kind is often found growing vpon old wals of
        Churches, and other houses in many places of England, and also
        among rubbish and stones. The single white and great yellow, as
        well as all the other double kindes, are noursed vp in Gardens
        onely with vs.


        The Time.

        All the single kindes doe flower many times in the end of
        Autumne, and if the Winter be milde all the Winter long, but
        especially in the moneths of February, March, and Aprill, and
        vntill the heate of the Spring doe spend them: but the other
        double kindes doe not continue flowring in that manner the
        yeare throughout, although very early sometimes, and very late
        also in some places.


        The Names.

        They are called by diuers names, as _Viola lutea_, _Leucoium
        luteum_, and _Keiri_, or _Cheiri_, by which name it is chiefly
        knowne in our Apothecaries shops, because there is an oyle made
        thereof called _Cheirinum_: In English they are vsually called
        in these parts, Wall-flowers: Others doe call them Bee-flowers;
        others Wall-Gilloflowers, Winter-Gilloflowers, and yellow
        Stocke-Gilloflowers; but we haue a kinde of Stocke-Gilloflower
        that more fitly deserueth that name, as shall be shewed in the
        Chapter following.


        The Vertues.

        The sweetnesse of the flowers causeth them to be generally
        vsed in Nosegayes, and to decke vp houses; but physically they
        are vsed in diuers manners: As a Conserue made of the flowers,
        is vsed for a remedy both for the Appoplexie and Palsie. The
        distilled water helpeth well in the like manner. The oyle made
        of the flowers is heating and resoluing, good to ease paines of
        strained and pained sinewes.




CHAP. XL.


_Leucoium._   Stocke-Gilloflower.

There are very many sorts of Stocke-Gilloflowers, both single and
double, some of the fields and mountaines, others of the Sea marshes
and medowes; and some noursed vp in Gardens, and there preserued by
seede or slippe, as each kinde is aptest to bee ordered. But because
some of these are fitter for a generall History then for this our
Garden of Pleasure, both for that diuers haue no good sent, others
little or no beauty, and to be entreated of onely for the variety, I
shall spare so many of them as are not fit for this worke, and onely
set downe the rest.

]


1. _Leucoium simplex sativum diversorum colorum._
Garden Stocke-Gilloflowers single of diuers colours.

These single Stocke-Gilloflowers, although they differ in the colour of
their flowers, yet are in leafe and manner of growing, one so like
vnto another, that vntill they come to flower, the one cannot be well
knowne that beareth red flowers, from another that beareth purple; and
therefore one description of the plant shall serue, with a declaration
of the sundry colours of the flowers. It riseth vp with round whitish
woody stalkes, two, three, or foure foot high, whereon are set many
long, and not very broad, soft, and whitish or grayish greene leaues,
somewhat round pointed, and parted into diuers branches, at the toppes
whereof grow many flowers, one aboue another, smelling very sweet,
consisting of foure small, long, and round pointed leaues, standing in
small long huskes, which turne into long and flat pods, sometimes halfe
a foote long, wherein is contained flat, round, reddish seedes, with
grayish ringes or circles about them, lying flat all along the middle
rib of the pod on both sides: the roote is long, white, and woody,
spreading diuers wayes. There is great variety in the colours of the
flowers: for some are wholly of a pure white colour, others of a most
excellent crimson red colour, others againe of a faire red colour,
but not so bright or liuely as the other, some also of a purplish or
violet colour, without any spot, marke, or line in them at all. There
are againe of all these colours, mixed very variably, as white mixed
with small or great spottes, strakes or lines of pure or bright red, or
darke red, and white with purple spots and lines; and of eyther of them
whose flowers are almost halfe white, and halfe red, or halfe white,
and halfe purple. The red of both sorts, and the purple also, in the
like manner spotted, striped, and marked with white, differing neyther
in forme, nor substance, in any other point.


2. _Leucoium satiuum albido luteum simplex._
The single pale yellow Stocke-Gilloflower.

There is very little difference in this kind from the former, for the
manner of growing, or forme of leaues or flower. Only this hath greener
leaues, and pale yellow almost white flowers, in all other things
alike: this is of no great regard, but only for rarity, and diuersity
from the rest.


3. _Leucoium Melancholicum._   The Melancholick Gentleman.

This wilde kinde of stocke gilloflower hath larger, longer and greener
leaues then any of the former kindes, vneuenly gashed or sinuated on
both edges lying on the ground, and a little rough or hairy withall:
from among which rise vp the stalkes, a yard high or more, and hairy
likewise, bearing thereon here and there some such like leaues as
are below, but smaller, and at the top a great number of flowers,
as large or larger then any of the former single kindes, made of 4.
large leaues a peece also, standing in such like long huskes, but of a
darke or sullen yellowish colour: after which come long roundish pods,
wherein lye somewhat long but rounder and greater seede then any stocke
gilloflower, and nearer both in pod and seede vnto the _Hesperis_ or
Dames Violet: this perisheth not vsually after seede bearing, although
sometimes it doth.


4. _Leucoium marinum Syriacum._   Leuant stocke gilloflowers.

This kind of stocke gilloflower riseth vp at the first with diuers long
and somewhat broad leaues, a little vneuenly dented or waued on the
edges, which so continue the first yeare after the sowing: the stalke
riseth vp the next yeare to bee two foot high or more, bearing all
those leaues on it that it first had, which then do grow lesse sinuated
or waued then before: at the top whereof stand many flowers, made of
foure leaues a peece, of a delayed purple colour, but of a small sent
which turne into very long and narrow flat pods, wherein are contained
flat seed like the ordinary stocke gilloflowers, but much larger and
of a darke or blackish browne colour: the root is white, and groweth
deepe, spreading in the ground, but growing woody when it is in seede,
and perisheth afterwards.


5. _Leucoij alterum genus, flore tam multiplici quam simplici ex
feminio oriundum._
Another sort of Stocke gilloflowers bearing as well double as single
        flowers from seede.

This kinde of Stocke gilloflower differeth neyther in forme of leaues,
stalkes, nor flowers from the former, but that it oftentimes groweth
much larger and taller; so that whosoeuer shall see both these growing
together, shall scarce discerne the difference, onely it beareth
flowers, eyther white, red or purple, wholly or entire, that is, of
one colour, without mixture of other colour in them (for so much as
euer I haue obserued, or could vnderstand by others) which are eyther
single, like vnto the former, or very thicke and double, like vnto the
next that followeth; but larger, and growing with more store of flowers
on the long stalke. But this you must vnderstand withall, that those
plants that beare double flowers, doe beare no seede at all, and is
very seldome encreased by slipping or cutting, as the next kinde of
double is: but the onely way to haue double flowers any yeare, (for
this kinde dyeth euery winter, for the most part, after it hath borne
flowers, and seldome is preserued) is to saue the seedes of those
plants of this kinde that beare single flowers, for from that seede
will rise, some that will beare single, and some double flowers, which
cannot bee distinguished one from another, I meane which will be single
and which double, vntill you see them in flower, or budde at the least.
And this is the only way to preserue this kinde: but of the seed of the
former kinde was neuer known any double flowers to arise, and therefore
you must be carefull to marke this kinde from the former.


6. _Leucoium flore pleno diuersorum colorum._
Double Stocke Gillowflowers of diuers colours.

This other kinde of Stock gilloflower that beareth onely double
flowers, groweth not so great, nor spreadeth his branches so farre,
nor are his leaues so large, but is in all things smaller, and lower,
and yet is woody, or shrubby, like the former, bearing his flowers
in the like manner, many vpon a long stalke, one aboue another, and
very double, but not so large as the former double, although it grow
in fertile soyle, which are eyther white, or red, or purple wholly,
without any mixture, or else mixed with spots and stripes, as the
single flowers of the first kinde, but more variably, and not in all
places alike, neuer bearing seede, but must be encreased, only by the
cutting of the young sproutes or branches, taken in a fit season: this
kinde perisheth not, as the former double kinde doth, so as it bee
defended in the winter from the extreame frosts, but especially from
the snow falling, or at the least remaining vpon it.


7. _Leucoium satiuum luteum flore pleno._
The double yellow Stocke Gilloflower.

This double yellow Stock gilloflower is a stranger in England, as far
as I can learne, neyther haue I any further familiaritie with him, then
by relation from Germany, where it is affirmed to grow only in some
of their gardens, that are curious louers of these delights, bearing
long leaues somewhat hoary or white, (and not greene like vnto the
Wallflower, whereunto else it might be thought to be referred) like
vnto the Stock gilloflowers, as the stalkes and branches also are, and
bearing faire double flowers, of a faire, but pale yellow colour. The
whole plant is tender, as the double Stock gilloflowers are, and must
be carefully preserued in the winter from the coldes, or rather more
then the last double, lest it perish.


        The Place.

        The single kindes, especially some of them, grow in Italie,
        and some in Greece, Candy, and the Isles adiacent, as may
        be gathered out of the verses in Plutarches Booke _De Amore
        fraterno_:

    _Inter Echinopodas velut asperam, & inter Ononim,
        Inter dum crescunt mollia Leucoia._

        Which sheweth, that the soft or gentle stocke gilloflowers doe
        sometimes grow among rough or prickely Furse and Cammocke. The
        other sorts are only to be found in gardens.


        The Time.

        They flower in a manner all the yeare throughout in some
        places, especially some of the single kindes, if they stand
        warme, and defended from the windes and cold: the double kindes
        flower sometimes in Aprill, and more plentifully in May, and
        Iune; but the double of seed, flowreth vsually late, and
        keepeth flowring vnto the winter, that the frostes and colde
        mistes doe pull it downe.


        The Names.

        It is called _Leucoium_, _&_ _Viola alba_: but the name
        Leucoium (which is in English the white Violet) is referred
        to diuers plants; we call it in English generally, Stocke
        gilloflower, (or as others doe, Stocke gillouer) to put a
        difference betweene them, and the Gilloflowers and Carnations,
        which are quite of another kindred, as shall be shewne in place
        conuenient.


        The Vertues.

        These haue no great vse in Physick that I know: only some haue
        vsed the leaues of the single white flowred kinde with salt, to
        be laid to the wrests of them that haue agues, but with what
        good successe I cannot say, if it happen well I thinke in one
        (as many such things else will) it will fayle in a number.




CHAP. XLI.


1. _Hesperis, siue Viola Matronalis._
Dames Violets, or Queenes Gilloflowers.

The ordinary Dames Violets, or Queene Gilloflowers, hath his leaues
broader, greener, and sharper pointed, then the Stock gilloflowers,
and a little endented about the edges: the stalkes grow two foot
high, bearing many greene leaues vpon them, smaller then those at the
bottome, and branched at the toppe, bearing many flowers, in fashion
much like the flowers of stocke gilloflowers, consisting of foure
leaues in like manner, but not so large, of a faint purplish colour
in some, and in others white, and of a pretty sweet sent, especially
towards night, but in the day time little or none at all: after the
flowers are past, there doe come small long and round pods, wherein
is contained, in two rowes, small and long blacke seede: the roote is
wholly composed of stringes or fibres, which abide many yeares, and
springeth fresh stalks euery yeare, the leaues abiding all the Winter.

]


2. _Hesperis Pannonica._   Dames Violets of Hungary.

The leaues of this Violet are very like the former, but smoother and
thicker, and not at all indented, or cut in on the edges: the flowers
are like the former, but of a sullen pale colour, turning themselues,
and seldome lying plaine open, hauing many purple veines, and streakes
running through the leaues of the flowers, of little or no sent in the
day time, but of a very sweete sent in the euening and morning; the
seedes are alike also, but a little browner.


3. _Lysimachia lutea siliquosa Virginiana._
The tree Primrose of Virginia.

Vnto what tribe or kindred I might referre this plant, I haue stood
long in suspence, in regard I make no mention of any other _Lysimachia_
in this work: lest therefore it should lose all place, let me ranke it
here next vnto the Dames Violets, although I confesse it hath little
affinity with them. The first yeare of the sowing the seede it abideth
without any stalke or flowers lying vpon the ground, with diuers long
and narrow pale greene leaues, spread oftentimes round almost like a
Rose, the largest leaues being outermost, and very small in the middle:
about May the next yeare the stalke riseth, which will be in Summer
of the height of a man, and of a strong bigge size almost to a mans
thumbe, round from the bottome to the middle, where it groweth crested
vp to the toppe, into as many parts as there are branches of flowers,
euery one hauing a small leafe at the foote thereof: the flowers stand
in order one aboue another, round about the tops of the stalks, euery
one vpon a short foot-stalke, consisting of foure pale yellow leaues,
smelling somewhat like vnto a Primrose, as the colour is also (which
hath caused the name) and standing in a greene huske, which parteth it
selfe at the toppe into foure parts or leaues, and turne themselues
downewards, lying close to the stalke: the flower hath some chiues
in the middle, which being past, there come in their places long and
cornered pods, sharpe pointed at the vpper end, and round belowe,
opening at the toppe when it is ripe into fiue parts, wherein is
contained small brownish seed: the roote is somewhat great at the head,
and wooddy, and branched forth diuersly, which perisheth after it hath
borne seede.


        The Place.

        The two first grow for the most part on Hils and in Woods, but
        with vs in Gardens onely.

        The last, as may be well vnderstood by the title, came out of
        Virginia.


        The Time.

        They flower in May, Iune, and Iuly.


        The Names.

        The name of _Hesperis_ is imposed by most Herbarists vpon the
        two first plants, although it is not certainly knowne to be the
        same that Theophrastus doth make mention of, in his sixth Booke
        and twenty fiue Chapter _de causis plantarum_: but because
        this hath the like effects to smell best in the euening, it
        is (as I said) imposed vpon it. It is also called _Viola
        Marina Matronalis_, _Hyemalis_, _Damascena_ and _Muschatella_:
        In English, Dames Violets, Queens Gilloflowers, and Winter
        Gilloflowers.

        The last hath his Latine name in the title as is best agreeing
        with it, and for the English, although it be too foolish I
        confesse, yet it may passe for this time till a fitter be
        giuen, vnlesse you please to follow the Latine, and call it
        Virginia Loose-strife.


        The Vertues.

        I neuer knew any among vs to vse these kindes of Violets in
        Physicke, although by reason of the sharpe biting taste,
        Dodonæus accounteth the ordinary sort to be a kinde of Rocket,
        and saith it prouoketh sweating, and vrine: and others affirme
        it to cut, digest, and cleanse tough flegme. The Virginian hath
        not beene vsed by any that I know, either inwardly or outwardly.




CHAP. XLII.


_Viola Lunaris siue Bolbonach._   The Sattin flower.

Vnto the kindes of Stocke-Gilloflowers I thinke fittest to adioyne
these kindes of Sattin-flowers, whereof there are two sorts, one
frequent enough in all our Countrie, the other is not so common.


1. _Viola Lunaris vulgaris._   The common white Sattin flower.

The first of these Sattin flowers, which is the most common, hath his
leaues broad belowe, and pointed at the end, snipt about the edges,
and of a darke greene colour: the stalkes are round and hard, two
foot high, or higher, diuided into many branches, set with the like
leaues, but smaller: the tops of the branches are beset with many
purplish flowers, like vnto Dames Violets, or Stocke Gilloflowers, but
larger, being of little sent: after the flowers are past, there come in
their places round flat thin cods, of a darke colour on the outside,
but hauing a thinne middle skinne, that is white and cleare shining,
like vnto very pure white Sattin it selfe, whereon lye flat and round
brownish seede, somewhat thicke and great: the rootes perish when they
haue giuen their seede, and are somewhat round, long, and thicke,
resembling the rootes of _Lilium non bulbosum_, or Day Lilly, which
are eaten (as diuers other rootes are) for Sallets, both in our owne
Country, and in many places beside.


2. _Viola Lunaris altera seu peregrina._   Long liuing Sattin flower.

This second kinde hath broader and longer leaues then the former, the
stalkes also are greener and higher, branching into flowers, of a
paler purple colour, almost white, consisting of foure leaues in like
manner, and smelling pretty sweete, bearing such like pods, but longer
and slenderer then they: the rootes are composed of many long strings,
which dye not as the former, but abide, and shoot out new stalkes euery
yeare.


        The Place.

        The first is (as is said) frequent enough in Gardens, and is
        found wilde in some places of our owne Country, as Master
        Gerard reporteth, whereof I neuer could be certainly assured,
        but I haue had it often sent mee among other seedes from Italy,
        and other places. The other is not so common in Gardens, but
        found about Watford, as he saith also.


        The Time.

        They flower in Aprill or May, and sometimes more early.


        The Names.

        It hath diuers names, as well in English as in Latine; for it
        is called most vsually _Bolbonach_, and _Viola Lunaris_: Of
        some _Viola latifolia_, and of others _Viola Peregrina_, and
        _Lunaria Græca_, _Lunaria maior_, and _Lunaria odorata_, and is
        thought to be _Thlaspi Crateuæ_: In English, White Satten, or
        Satten flower: Of some it is called Honesty, and Penny-flower.


        The Vertues.

        Some doe vse to eate the young rootes hereof, before they runne
        vp to flower, as Rampions are eaten with Vinegar and Oyle; but
        wee know no Physicall vse they haue.




CHAP. XLIII.


_Linum siluestre & Linaria._   Wilde Flaxe and Tode Flaxe.

Although neither the manured Line or Flaxe is a plant fit for our
Garden, nor many of the wilde sorts, yet there are some, whose pleasant
and delightfull aspect doth entertaine the beholders eyes with good
content, and those I will set downe here for varietie, and adioyne vnto
them some of the _Linarias_, or Tode Flaxe, for the neare affinity with
them.


1. _Linum siluestre flore albo._   Wilde Flaxe with a white flower.

This kinde of wilde Flaxe riseth vp with diuers slender branches, a
foote high or better, full of leaues, standing without order, being
broader and longer then the manured Flaxe: the tops of the branches
haue diuers faire white flowers on them, composed of fiue large leaues
a peece, with many purple lines or strikes in them: the seede vessell
as well as the seede, is like vnto the heads and seede of the manured
Flaxe: the rootes are white strings, and abide diuers yeares, springing
fresh branches and leaues euery yeare, but not vntill the Spring of the
yeare.


2. _Linum siluestre luteum._   Wilde Flaxe with a yellow flower.

This wilde Flaxe doth so well resemble a kinde of St. Iohns wort, that
it will soone deceiue one that doth not aduisedly regard it: For it
hath many reddish stalkes, and small leaues on them, broader then the
former wilde Flaxe, but not so long, which are well stored with yellow
flowers, as large as the former, made of fiue leaues a peece, which
being past, there come small flattish heads, containing blackish seede,
but not shining like the former: the rootes hereof dye not euery yeare,
as many other of the wilde kindes doe, but abide and shoote out euery
yeare.


3. _Linaria purpurea._   Purple Tode Flaxe.

This purple Tode Flaxe hath diuers thicke, small, long, and somewhat
narrowish leaues, snipt about the edges, of a whitish greene colour,
from among which rise vp diuers stalkes, replenished at the tops with
many small flowers, standing together one aboue another spike-fashion,
which are small and somewhat sweete, while they are fresh, fashioned
somewhat like the common Tode flaxe that groweth wilde abroad almost
euery where, but much smaller, with a gaping mouth, but without any
crooked spurre behinde, like vnto them, sometimes of a sad purple neare
vnto a Violet, and sometimes of a paler blew colour, hauing a yellow
spot in the middle or gaping place: after the flowers are past, there
come small, hard, round heads, wherein are contained small, flat, and
grayish seede: the roote is small and perisheth for the most part euery
yeare, and will spring againe of it owne sowing, if it be suffered to
shed it selfe, yet some hard Winters haue killed the seede it should
seeme, in that sometimes it faileth to spring againe, and therefore had
neede to be sowne anew in the Spring.


4. _Linaria purpurea odorata._   Sweete purple Tode Flaxe.

The lower leaues of this purple Tode Flaxe are nothing like any of
the rest, but are long and broad, endented about the edges, somewhat
resembling the leaues of the greater wilde white Daisie: the stalke is
set at the bottome with such like leaues, but a little more diuided and
cut in, and still smaller and smaller vpward, so that the vppermost
leaues are very like the common Tode Flaxe, the toppe whereof is
branched, hauing diuers small flowers growing along vpon then, in
fashion and colour almost like the last described Tode Flaxe, but not
altogether so deepe a purple: the heads and seedes are very like the
former, but that the seede of this is reddish; the flowers in their
naturall hot Countries haue a fine sent, but in these colder, little or
none at all: the rootes are small and threadie, and perish after they
haue flowred and seeded.

   5 _Antirrhinum maius._ The greater Snapdragon.
   6 _Chamænerium flore delphinij._ The willowe flower.
]


5. _Linaria Valentina._   Tode Flaxe of Valentia.

This Spanish Tode Flaxe hath three or foure thicker and bigger stalkes
then the former, bearing small broad leaues, like vnto the small
Centory, two or three together at a ioynt, round about the lower end
of the stalkes, but without any order vpwards, at the toppes whereof
stand many flowers, in fashion like vnto the common kinde, and almost
as large, of a faire yellow colour, but the gaping mouth is downie, and
the spurre behinde of a purplish colour.


6. _Scoparia siue Beluidere Italorum._   Broome Tode Flaxe.

Although this plant haue no beautifull flowers, yet because the greene
plant full of leaues is so delightfull to behold, being in Italy and
other places planted not onely in their Gardens, but set likewise in
pots to furnish their Windowes, and euen with vs also hath growne to
be so dainty a greene bush, that I haue thought it worthy to be among
the delights of my Garden; the description whereof is as followeth:
This pleasant Broome Flaxe riseth vp most vsually with one straight
vpright square stalke, three foote and a halfe high or better in our
Gardens, branching it selfe out diuers waies, bearing thereon many long
narrow leaues, like the Garden Line or Flaxe, very thicke set together,
like vnto a bush, or rather like vnto a faire greene Cypresse tree,
growing broad belowe, and spire-fashion vpwards, of a very faire greene
colour: at the seuerall ioynts of the branches, towards the tops, and
among the leaues, there come forth small reddish flowers, not easily
seene nor much regarded, being of no beauty, which turne into small
round blackish gray seede: the rootes are a number of blackish strings
set together, and the whole plant perisheth euery yeare at the first
approach of any cold ayre, as if it neuer had beene so faire a greene
bush.


        The Place.

        These kindes of wilde Flaxe doe growe naturally in diuers
        places, some in Germany, some in Spaine, and some in Italy.
        Those that delight in the beauty of natures variety, doe
        preserue them, to furnish vp the number of pleasant aspects.


        The Time.

        They all flower in the Summer moneths, and soone after perfect
        their seede.


        The Names.

        Their names are sufficiently expressed in their titles, yet I
        must giue you to vnderstand that the last is called of some
        _Linaria magna_, and of others _Osyris_.


        The Vertues.

        The wilde Flaxe hath no medecinable vertue appropriate vnto
        it that is knowne. The Tode Flaxe is accounted to be good, to
        cause one to make water.




CHAP. XLIIII.

_Antirrhinum._   Snapdragon.


There is some diuersity in the Snapdragons, some being of a larger, and
others of a lesser stature and bignesse; and of the larger, some of
one, and some of another colour, but because the small kindes are of no
beautie, I shall at this time onely entreate of the greater sorts.


1. _Antirrhinum album._   White Snapdragon.

The leaues of these Snapdragons (for I doe vnder one description
comprehend the rest) are broader, longer, and greener then the leaues
of the Garden Flaxe, or of the wilde Flaxe set confusedly vpon the
tender greene branches, which are spread on all sides, from the very
bottome, bearing at the toppes many flowers, somewhat resembling the
former Tode Flaxe, but much larger, and without any heele or spurre, of
a faire white colour, with a yellow spot in the mouth or gaping place:
after the flowers are past, there come vp in their places hard round
seede vessels, fashioned somewhat like vnto a Calues head, the snout
being cut off, wherein is contained small blacke seede: the rootes are
many white strings, which perish in most places after they haue giuen
seede, notwithstanding any care or paines taken with them to preserue
them aliue, and yet they will abide in some places where they are
defended in the Winter.


2. _Antirrhinum purpureum siue roseum._   Purple Snapdragon.

The purple Snapdragon is in stalkes, leaues, and flowers altogether
like the former, and as large and great in euery part, or greater; the
only difference is, that this beareth pale Stammell or Rose coloured
flowers, with a yellow spot in the mouth, and sometimes of a paler
colour, almost blush.


3. _Antirrhinum variegatum._   Variable Snapdragon.

This variable kinde is somewhat lesse, and tenderer then the last
described, hauing also a reddish or blush coloured flower, lesser then
the former, but much bigger then the middle kinde of Snapdragon (which
is not set downe in this worke) the yellow spot in the mouth of it hath
some white about it, and extending to both sides of the spot: the heads
and seede are like the former: the rootes are smaller, but neuer will
abide after they haue giuen flowers and seede.


4. _Antirrhinum luteum._   Yellow Snapdragon.

There is likewise another of these kindes, that beareth leaues as large
as any of the former, & very faire yellow flowers, as large likewise
as they, not differing in any thing else from the first; let not any
therefore imagine this to be a _Linaria_ or Tode Flaxe: for all parts
are answerable vnto the Snapdragons.


        The Place.

        All these are nourished with vs in our Gardens, although in
        Spaine and Italy they are found growing wilde.


        The Time.

        They flower for the most part the second yeare after the
        sowing, from Aprill vntill Iuly, and the seede is quickly ripe
        after.


        The Names.

        The name _Antirrhinum_ is vsually giuen to this plant,
        although it fully agreeth not eyther with the description of
        Dioscorides, or Theophrastus: It hath also diuers other names
        in Latine, as _Orontium_, _Canis cerebrum Os Leonis_, _Leo
        herba_, _&c._ In English Calues snout, from the forme of the
        seede vessels, and Snapdragon, or Lyons mouth, from the forme
        of the flowers.


        The Vertues.

        They are seldome or neuer vsed in Physicke by any in our dayes.




CHAP. XLV.

_Chamænerium flore delphinij._   The Willowe flower.


This plant riseth vp with many strong, woddy, round, brownish great
stalkes, three or foure foote high, beset here and there without order,
with one broad and long whitish greene leafe at a ioynt, somewhat like
vnto a _Lysimachia_, or Willowe herbe, as also vnto a Peach leafe, but
larger and longer: at the toppe of the branches stand many flowers
one aboue another, of a pale reddish purple colour, consisting of
fiue leaues, spread open with an heele or spurre behinde them, with
many yellow threads in the middle, much larger then any flower of the
Larkes spurres, and smelling somewhat sweete withall; it beareth a
shew of long pods with seede, but I could neuer obserue the seede: the
rootes are like the rootes of _Lysimachia_, or the ordinary yellow
Loose-strife, or Willowe herbe, but greater: running and spreading
vnder ground, and shooting vp in many places, whereby it filleth a
ground that it likes quickly: the stalkes dye downe euery yeare, and
spring againe in many places farre asunder.


        The Place.

        Wee haue not knowne where this Willowe flower groweth
        naturally, but we haue it standing in an out corner of our
        Gardens, to fill vp the number of delightfull flowers.


        The Time.

        It flowreth not vntill May, and abideth a long while flowring.


        The Names.

        It may seeme to diuers, that this is that plant that Dodonæus
        called _Pseudolysimachium purpureum minus_, and Lobel seemeth
        by the name of _Delphinium buccinum_ to aime at this plant,
        but withall calleth it _Chamænerium Gesneri_, and giueth the
        same figure that Dodonæus hath for his _Pseudolysimachium_:
        But that is one kinde of plant (which hath smaller and shorter
        stalkes, and very narrow long leaues, whose flowers stand vpon
        long slender cods, full of downe, with reddish seede, like vnto
        the _Lysimachia siliquosa siluestris_, and rootes that abide
        many yeares, but creepe not) and this is another, much greater,
        whose true figure is not extant in any Author that I know. It
        is vsually called _Chamænerium flore delphinij_; but the name
        of _Delphinium buccinum_ in my minde may not so conueniently be
        applyed vnto it. It is called in English, The Willowe flower,
        for the likenesse of the leaues, and the beauty and respect of
        the flowers.


        The Vertues.

        There is no vse hereof in Physicke that euer I could learne,
        but is onely cherished among other sorts of flowers, that serue
        to decke and set forth a Garden of varieties.




CHAP. XLVI.

_Aquilegia._   Colombines.


There are many sorts of Colombines, as well differing in forme as
colour of the flowers, and of them both single and double carefully
noursed vp in our Gardens, for the delight both of their forme and
colours.


1. _Aquilegia vulgaris flore simplici._   Single Colombines.

Because the whole difference of these Colombines standeth in the
varieties of the forme, and colour of the flowers, and little in the
leaues, I shall not neede to make anie repetitions of the description
of them, seeing one onely shall suffice for each peculiar kinde. The
Colombine hath diuers large spread leaues, standing on long stalkes:
euery one diuided in seuerall partitions, and roundly endented about
the edges, in colour somewhat like the leaues of Celondine, that is,
of a darke blewish greene colour: the stalkes rise vp sometimes two
or three foote high, diuided vsually into many branches, bearing one
long diuided leafe at the lower ioynt, aboue which the flowers growe,
euery one standing on a long stalke, consisting of fiue hollow leaues,
crooked or horned at the ends, turning backward, the open flower
shewing almost like vnto a Cinquefoile, but more hollow: after the
flowers are past, there arise small long cods, foure or fiue together,
wherein are contained blacke shining seede: the rootes are thicke
and round, for a little space within the ground, and then diuided
into branches, ending in many small fibres, abiding many yeares, and
shooting a fresh euery Spring from the round heads, that abide all the
Winter. The variety of the colours of these flowers are very much, for
some are wholly white, some of a blew or violet colour, others of a
blush or flesh colour, or deepe or pale red, or of a dead purple, or
dead murrey colour, as nature listeth to shew it selfe.


2. _Aquilegia vulgaris flore pleno._   Double Colombines.

The double Colombines differ not in leafe or manner of growing from the
single, so that vntill they come to flower, they cannot bee discerned
one from another; the onely difference is, it beareth very thicke and
double flowers, that is, many horned or crooked hollow leaues set
together, and are not so large as the leaues of the single flowers. The
variety of colours in this double kinde is as plentifull, or rather
more then in the single; for of these is party coloured, blew and
white, and spotted very variably, which are not in the single kinde,
and also a very deepe red, very thicke and double, but a smaller
flower, and lesse plentifull in bearing then many of the other double
sorts. These double kindes doe giue as good seede as the single kindes
doe, which is not obserued in many other plants.


3. _Aquilegia inuersis corniculis._   Double inuerted Colombines.

These Colombines are not to be distinguished eyther in roote, leaues,
or seed from the former, the flowers onely make the difference, which
are as double as the former, but that the heeles or hornes of these are
turned inward, and stand out in the middle of the flowers together:
there is not that plentifull variety of colours in this kinde, as there
is in the former: for I neuer saw aboue three of foure seuerall colours
in this kinde, that is, white, purplish, reddish, and a dun or darke
ouerworne purplish colour. These double flowers doe likewise turne into
pods, bearing seede, continuing his kind, and not varying into the
former.


4. _Aquilegia Rosea._   Rose Colombines.

The leaues and other parts of this kinde of Colombine, differ little
or nothing from the former, the diuersitie consisteth likewise in the
flowers, which although they stand in the same manner seuerally vpon
their small stalkes, somewhat more sparingly then the former doe,
yet they haue no heeles or hornes, eyther inward or outward, or very
seldome, but stand sometimes but with eight or tenne smooth small
plaine leaues, set in order one by one in a compasse, in a double rowe,
and sometimes with foure or fiue rowes of them, euery one directly
before the other, like vnto a small thick double Rose layd open, or a
spread Marigold: yet sometimes it happeneth, that some of these flowers
will haue two or three of the first rowes of leaues without any heele,
and the rest that are inward with each of them a peece of a small horne
at them, as the former haue: the colours of these flowers are almost
as variable, and as variably mixed as the former double kindes. This
likewise giueth seede, preseruing his owne kinde for the most part.


5. _Aquilegia degener._   Degenerate Colombines.

This kinde of Colombine might seeme to some, to bee but a casuall
degeneration, and no true naturall kinde, happening by some cause of
transplanting, or otherwise by the art of man: but I haue not so found
it, in that it keepeth, and holdeth his own proper forme, which is like
vnto the double Rose Colombine, but that the outermost row of leaues
are larger then any of the rest inwardes, and is of a greenish, or else
of a purplish greene colour, and is not altogether so apt to giue good
seed like the former.


        The Place.

        The single kindes haue beene often found in some of the wooddy
        mountaines of Germany, as Clusius saith, but the double kindes
        are chiefly cherished in gardens.


        The Time.

        They flower not vntill May, and abide not for the most part
        when Iune is past, and in the meane time perfecteth their
        seede.


        The Names.

        Costæus doth call this plant _Pothos_ of Theophrastus, which
        Gaza translateth _Desiderium_. Dalechampius vpon Athenæus,
        calleth it _Diosanthos_, or _Iouis flos_ of Theophrastus, who
        in his sixth Booke and seuenth Chapter reckoneth them both,
        that is, _Diosanthos_ and _Pothos_, to be Summer flowers, but
        seuerally. Dodonæus _Leoherba_, and Gesner _Leontostomium_.
        Fabius Columna in his Phytobasanos, vnto whom Clusius giueth
        the greatest approbation, referreth it to the _Isopyrum_ of
        Dioscorides. All later Writers doe generally call it, eyther
        _Aquileia_, _Aquilina_, or _Aquilegia_; and we in English,
        generally (I thinke) through the whole Countrey, Colombines.
        Some doe call the _Aquilegia rosea_, _Aquilegia stellata_, The
        starre Colombine; because the leaues of the flowers doe stand
        so directly one by another, besides the doublenesse, that they
        somewhat represent eyther a Rose or a Starre, and thereupon
        they giue it the name eyther of a Starre or Rose.

]


        The Vertues.

        Some in Spaine, as Camerarius saith, vse to eate a peece of
        the roote hereof fasting, many dayes together, to helpe them
        that are troubled with the stone in the kidneyes. Others vse
        the decoction, of both herbe and roote in wine, with a little
        Ambargrise, against those kinds of swounings, which the Greekes
        call ἀδυναμία. The seede is vsed for the iaundise, and other
        obstructions of the liuer. Clusius writeth from the experience
        of Franciscus Rapard, a chiefe Physician of Bruges in Flanders,
        that the seede beaten and drunke is effectuall to women in
        trauell of childe, to procure a speedy deliuerie, and aduiseth
        a second draught thereof should be taken if the first succeede
        not sufficiently.




CHAP. XLVII.

_Thalictrum Hispanicum._   Spanish Tufts, Or Tufted Columbines.


From among the diuersities of this plant, I haue selected out two sorts
for this my garden, as hauing more beautie then all the rest; leauing
the other to be entreated of, where all in generall may be included. I
haue in this place inserted them, for the likenesse of the leaues only,
being in no other part correspondent, and in a Chapter by themselues,
as it is most fit.


_Thalictrum Hispanicum album._   White Spanish tufted Colombines.

These plants haue both one forme, in roote, leafe and flower, and
therefore neede but one description. The leaues are both for colour
and forme so like vnto Colombines leaues (although lesser and darker,
yet more spread, and on larger stalkes) that they may easily deceiue
one, that doth not marke them aduisedly; for the leaues are much more
diuided, and in smaller parts, and not so round at the ends: the
stalkes are round, strong, and three foote high at the least, branching
out into two or three parts, with leaues at the seuerall ioynts of
them, at the toppes whereof stand many flowers, which are nothing but
a number of threads, made like vnto a small round tuft, breaking out
of a white skinne, or leafe, which incloseth them, and being vnblowne,
shew like vnto little buttons: the colour of these threds or tufts in
this are whitish with yellow tips on them, and somewhat purplish at the
bottome, hauing a strong but no good sent, and abiding in their beautie
(especially if they grow in the shade, and not too hot in the sun) a
great while, and then fall away, like short downe or threds: the seed
vessels are three square, containing small, long, and round seede; the
rootes are many long yellow fringes, which endure and encrease much.


_Thalictrum Montanum purpureum._   Purple tufted Colombines.

This purple tufted Colombine differeth onely from the former, in that
it is not so high nor so large, and that the colour of the flower or
tuft is of a blewish purple colour with yellow tips, and is much more
rare then the other.


        The Place.

        These grow both in Spaine and Italie.


        The Time.

        They flower in the end of May, or in Iune, and sometimes later.


        The Names.

        Some doe call them _Thaliotrum_, and some _Thalictrum_. Others
        _Ruta palustris_, and _Ruta pratensis_, and some _Rhabarbarum
        Monachorum_, or _Pseudo-rhabarbarum_, by reason that the
        rootes being yellow, haue an opening qualitie, and drying as
        Rubarbe. In English what other fit Names to giue these then I
        haue expressed in the titles, I know not.


        The Vertues.

        They are a little hot and drying withall, good for old Vlcers,
        as Dioscorides saith, to bring them to cicatrising: in Italy
        they are vsed against the Plague, and in Saxonye against the
        Iaundise, as Camerarius saith.




CHAP. XLVIII.

_Radix caua._   Hollow roote.


The likenesse of the leaues likewise of this plant with Colombines,
hath caused mee to insert it next the other, and although some of this
kinde bee of small respect, being accounted but foolish, yet let it
fill vp a waste corner, that so no place be vnfurnished.


1. _Radix Caua maior flore albo._   The white Hollow roote.

The leaues of this hollow roote breake not out of the ground, vntill
the end of March, or seldome before, and are both for proportion and
colour somewhat like vnto the leaues of Colombines, diuided into fiue
parts, indented about the edges, standing on small long footestalkes
of a whitish greene colour, among which rise vp the stalkes, without
any leaues from the bottome to the middle, where the flowers shoote
forth one aboue another, with euery one a small short leafe at the
foote thereof, which are long and hollow, with a spurre behinde it,
somewhat like vnto the flowers of Larckes spurres, but hauing their
bellies somewhat bigger, and the mouth not so open, being all of a pure
white colour: after the flowers are past, arise small long and round
cods, wherein are contained round blackish seede: the roote is round
and great, of a yellowish browne colour on the outside, and more yellow
within, and hollow vnderneath, so that it seemeth but a shell: yet
being broken, euery part will grow: it abideth greene aboue ground but
a small time.


2. _Radix Caua maior flore carneo._   Blush colourd Hollow roote.

The blush Hollow roote is in all things like vnto the former, but onely
that the flowers hereof are of a delayed red or purple colour, which
we call blush: and sometimes of a very deepe red or purple colour; but
very rare to meete with.

3. _Radix Caua minor, seu Capnos fabacea radice._   Small hollow roote.

This small kinde hath his leaues of a blewish greene colour, yet
greener and smaller then the former, growing more thicke together: the
flowers are like in proportion vnto the former in all respects, but
lesser, hauing purplish backes, and white bellyes: standing closer and
thicker together vpon the short stalkes: the roote is solid or firme,
round and a little long withall, two being vsually ioyned together,
yellowish both within and without: but I haue seene the dry roots that
came from beyond Sea hither, that haue beene as small as hasell nuts,
and somewhat flat with the roundnesse, differing from those that growe
with vs, whether the nature thereof is to alter by manuring I know not.


        The Place.

        The greater kindes Clusius reporteth he found in many places of
        Hungarie, and the other parts neare thereunto: the lesser in
        the lower Germany, or Low Countries, as we call them.


        The Time.

        These are most truely to bee reckoned Vernall plants, for that
        they rise not out of the ground vntill the Spring bee come in,
        and are gone likewise before it be past, remaining vnder ground
        all the rest of the yeare, yet the lesser abideth longer aboue
        ground then the greater.


        The Names.

        Concerning the former of these, there is a controuersie among
        diuers, whether it should be _Thesium_ of Theophrastus, or
        _Eriphium_ of Galen, but here is no fit place to trauerse those
        opinions. Some would haue it to bee _Corydalis_, and some
        referre it to Plinie his _Capnos Chelidonia_, for the likenesse
        it hath both with Fumeterie and Celandine. It is generally
        called of all moderne Writers, _Radix Caua_, and we in English
        thereafter, Hollow roote. The lesser for the firmnesse of his
        round roote, is vsually called, _Capnos fabacea radice_, and
        the Dutch men thereafter, =Boonkens Hollwortell=: we of the
        likenesse with the former, doe call it the lesse Hollow roote.


        The Vertues.

        Some by the bitternesse doe coniecture (for little proofe hath
        beene had thereof, but in outward cases) that it clenseth,
        purgeth, and dryeth withall.




CHAP. XLIX.

_Delphinium._   Larkes heeles.


Of Larkes heeles there are two principall kindes, the wilde kinde, and
the tame or garden; the wilde kinde is of two sorts, one which is with
vs noursed vp chiefly in gardens, and is the greatest; the other which
is smaller and lower, often found in our plowed landes, and elsewhere:
of the former of these wilde sorts, there are double as well as single:
and of the tame or more vpright, double also and single: and of each of
diuers colours, as shall be set downe.


1. _Delphinium maius siue vulgare._   The ordinary Larkes heeles.

The common Larkes heele spreadeth with many branches much more ground
then the other, rather leaning or bending downe to the ground, then
standing vpright, whereon are set many small long greene leaues, finely
cut, almost like Fennell leaues: the branches end in a long spike of
hollow flowers, with a long spurre behinde them, very like vnto the

[Sidenote: _Varietas._]

flowers of the Hollow roote last described, and are of diuers seuerall
colours, as of a blewish purple colour, or white, or ash colour or red,
paler or deeper, as also party coloured of two colours in a flower;
after the flowers are past, (which in this kinde abide longer then in
the other) there come long round cods, containing very blacke seede:
the root is hard after it groweth vp to seede, spreading both abroad
and deepe, and perisheth euery yeare, vsually raising it selfe from it
own sowing, as well as from the seede sowen in the spring time.


2. _Delphinium vulgare flore pleno._   Double common Larkes heeles.

Of this vulgar kinde there is some difference in the flower, although
in nothing else: the flowers stand many vpon a stalke like the former,
but euery one of them are as if three or foure small flowers were
ioyned together, with euery one his spurre behinde, the greatest flower
being outermost, and as it were containing the rest, which are of a
pale red, or deepe blush colour: Another of this kinde will beare his
flowers with three or foure rowes of leaues in the middle, making a
double flower with one spurre behinde onely: and of this kinde there is
both with purple, blew, blush, and white flowers, and party coloured
also; these doe all beare seed like the single, wherby it is increased
euery yeare.


3. _Delphinium aruense._   Wilde Larkes spurres.

This wilde Larkes spurre hath smaller and shorter leaues, smaller and
lower branches, and more thinly or sparsedly growing vpon them, then
any of the former: the flowers likewise are neyther so large as any
of the former, nor so many growing together, the cods likewise haue
smaller seede, and is harder to grow in gardens then any of the former,
the most vsuall colour hereof is a pale reddish or blush colour, yet
sometimes they are found both white and blew, and sometimes mixt of
blew and blush, variably disposed, as nature can when she listeth; but
are much more rare.


4. _Delphinium elatius flore simplici diuersorum colorum._
Single vpright bearing Larkes heeles of many colours.

The difference betweene this and the last is, that the leaues of this
are not fully so greene, nor so large; the stalkes grow vpright,
to the height of a man, and sometimes higher, hauing some branches
thereon, but fewer then the former, and standing likewise vpright, and
not leaning downe as the former: the toppes of the stalkes are better
stored with flowers then the other, being sometimes two foote long
and aboue, of the same fashion, but not altogether so large, but of
more diuers and seueral colours, as white, pale, blush, redde deeper
or paler, ashcoloured, purple or violet, and of an ouerworne blewish
purple, or iron colour: for of all these we haue simple, without any
mixture or spot: but we haue other sorts, among the simple colours,
that rise from the same seede, and will haue flowers that wil be halfe
white, and halfe blush or purple, or one leafe white, and another blush
or purple, or else variably mixed and spotted: the seede and seede
vessels are like the former but larger and harder.


5. _Delphinium elatius flore pleno diuersorum colorum._
Double vpright Larkes heeles of many colours.

These double Larkes heeles cannot bee knowne from the single of the
same kinde, vntill they come towards flowring; for there appeare many
flowers vpon the stalkes, in the same manner, and of as many colours
almost as of the single, except the party coloured, which stand like
little double Roses, layd or spread broade open, as the Rose Colombine
without any heeles behinde them, very delightfull to behold, consisting
of many small leaues growing together, and after they are fallen there
come vp in their places three or foure small cods set together, wherein
is contained here and there (for all are not full of seede, as the
single kindes) blacke seede, like vnto all the rest, but smaller, which
being sowen will bring plants that will beare both single and double
flowers againe, and it often happeneth, that it variably altereth in
colours from it owne sowing: for none of them hold constantly his owne
colour, (so farre as euer I could obserue) but fall into others; as
nature pleaseth.


6. _Delphinium Hispanicum paruum._   Spanish wilde Larkes spurres.

This small Larkes spurre of Spaine, hath diuers long and broad leaues
next the ground, cut-in on both sides, somewhat like vnto the leafe
of a Scabious, or rather that kinde of Stœbe, which Lobel calleth
Crupina, for it doth somewhat neerly resemble the same, but that this
is smooth on the edges, and not indented besides the cuts, as the
_Crupina_ is, being of a whitish greene colour, and somewhat smooth and
soft in handling: among the leaues riseth vp a whitish greene stalke,
hauing many smaller leaues vpon it that grow belowe, but not diuided,
branching out into many small stalkes, bearing flowers like vnto the
wilde Larkes heeles, but smaller, and of a bleake blewish colour, which
being past, there come vp two or three small cods ioyned together,
wherein is blacke seede, smaller and rounder then any of the former:
the roote is small and thready, quickly perishing with the first cold
that ouertaketh the plant.


        The Place.

        The greatest or first wilde kindes growe among corne in many
        countries beyond the Seas, and where corne hath beene sowne,
        and for his beauty brought and nourished in our Gardens: the
        lesser wilde kinde in some fields of our owne Country. The
        Spanish kinde likewise in the like places, which I had among
        many seedes that Guillaume Boel brought mee out of Spaine. The
        first double and single haue been common for many yeares in all
        countries of this Land, but the tall or vpright single kindes
        haue been entertained but of late yeares. The double kindes are
        more rare.


        The Time.

        These flower in the Summer onely, but the Spanish wilde kinde
        flowreth very late, so that oftentimes in our Country, the
        Winter taketh it before it can giue ripe seede: the double
        kindes, as well the vpright as the ordinary or wilde, are very
        choise and dainty many times, not yeelding good seede.


        The Names.

        They are called diuersly by diuers Writers, as _Consolida
        regulis_, _Calcaris flos_; _Flos regius_, _Buccinum Romanorum_,
        and of Matthiolus, _Cuminum siluestre alterum Dioscoridis_: but
        the most vsuall name with vs is _Delphinium_: but whether it be
        the true _Delphinium_ of Dioscorides, or the Poets Hyacinth, or
        the flower of Aiax, another place is fitter to discusse then
        this. Wee call them in English Larkes heeles, Larkes spurres,
        Larkes toes, or clawes, and Monkes hoods. The last or Spanish
        kinde came to mee vnder the name of _Delphinium latifolium
        trigonum_, so stiled eyther from the diuision of the leaues,
        or from the pods, which come vsually three together. Bauhinus
        vpon Matthiolus calleth it, _Consolida regalis peregrina paruo
        flore_.


        The Vertues.

        There is no vse of any of these in Physicke in these dayes that
        I know, but are wholly spent for their flowers sake.

_Balsamina fœmina._   The Female Balsam Apple.


I haue set this plant in this place, for some likenesse of the flower,
rather then for any other comparison, euen as I must also with the
next that followeth. This plant riseth vp with a thicke round reddish
stalke, with great and bunched ioynts, being tender and full of iuice,
much like to the stalke of Purslane, but much greater, which brancheth
it selfe forth from the very ground, into many stalkes, bearing thereon
manie long greene leaues, snipt about the edges, very like vnto the
Almond or Peach tree leaues; among which from the middle of the
stalkes vpwards round about them, come forth vpon seuerall small short
foot-stalkes many faire purplish flowers, of two or three colours in
them, fashioned somewhat like the former Larkes heeles, or Monks hoods,
but that they are larger open at the mouth, and the spurres behinde
crooke or bend downewards: after the flowers are past, there come in
their places round rough heads, pointed at the end, greene at the
first, and a little yellower when they bee ripe, containing within them
small round blackish seede, which will soone skippe out of the heads,
if they be but a little hardly pressed betweene the fingers: the rootes
spread themselues vnder ground very much from the toppe, with a number
of small fibres, annexed thereunto: this is a very tender plant, dying
euery yeare, and must bee sowne carefully in a pot of earth, and tended
and watered in the heate of Summer, and all little enough to bring it
to perfection.

        The Place.

        Wee haue alwaies had the seede of this plant sent vs out of
        Italy, not knowing his originall place.


        The Time.

        It flowreth from the middle of Iuly, to the end of August: the
        seed doth seldome ripen with vs, especially if the Summer be
        backward, so that wee are oftentimes to seeke for new and good
        seede from our friends againe.


        The Names.

        Some vse to call it _Charantia fœmina_, _Balsamina fœmina_,
        _Balsamella_, and _Anguillara_, _Herba Sanctæ Katharinæ_. We
        haue no other English name to call it by, then the Female
        Balsame Apple, or _Balsamina_.


        The Vertues.

        Some by reason of the name, would attribute the property of
        Balme vnto this plant, but it is not sufficiently knowne to
        haue any such; yet I am well perswaded, there may bee some
        extraordinary quality in so beautifull a plant, which yet lyeth
        hid from vs.




CHAP. LI.

_Nasturtium Indicum._   Indian Cresses, or yellow Larkes heeles.


The likenesse (as I said before) of this flower likewise, hauing
spurres or heeles maketh me ioyne it with the rest, which is of so
great beauty and sweetnesse withall, that my Garden of delight cannot
bee vnfurnished of it. This faire plant spreadeth it selfe into very
many long trayling branches, enterlaced one within another very
confusedly (yet doth it not winde it selfe with any claspers about
either pole or any other thing, but if you will haue it abide close
thereunto, you must tye it, or else it will lye vpon the ground) foure
or fiue foot in length at the least, wherby it taketh vp a great deale
of ground: the leaues are smooth, greene, and as round as the Penniwort
that groweth on the ground, without any cut or incisure therein at all
in any part, the stalkes whereof stand in the middle of each leafe and
stand at euery ioynt of the stalke, where they are a little reddish,
and knobbed or bunched out: the flowers are of an excellent gold yellow
colour, and grow all along these stalkes, almost at euery ioynt with
the leaues, vpon pretty long foote-stalkes, which are composed of fiue
leaues, not hollow or gaping, but standing open each leafe apart by it
selfe, two of them, that be larger and longer then the other, stand
aboue and the other two that are lesser belowe, which are a little
iagged or bearded on both sides, and the first lowest: in the middle of
each of the three lower leaues (yet sometimes it is but in two of them)
there is a little long spot or streake, of an excellent crimson colour,
with a long heele or spurre behinde hanging downe: the whole flower
hath a fine small sent, very pleasing, which being placed in the middle
of some Carnations or Gilloflowers (for they are in flower at the same
time) make a delicate Tussimussie, as they call it, or Nosegay, both
for sight and sent: After the flower is past, come the seede, which
are rough or vneuen, round, greenish yellow heads, sometimes but one,
and sometimes two or three standing together vpon one stalke, bare
or naked of themselues, without any huske, containing a white pulpy
kernell; the rootes are small, and spreading vnder ground, which perish
with the first frosts, and must be sowne a new euery yeare; yet there
needeth no bed of horse-dung for the matter: the naturall ground will
be sufficient, so as you defend it a little from those frosts, that may
spoile it when it is newly sprung vp, or being yet tender.


        The Place.

        This goodly plant was first found in the West Indies, and from
        thence sent into Spaine vnto Monardus and others, from whence
        all other parts haue receiued it. It is now very familiar in
        most Gardens of any curiosity, where it yearly giueth ripe
        seed, except the yeare be very vnkindly.


        The Time.

        It flowreth sometimes in Iune, but vsually in Iuly (if it
        be well defended and in any good ground) and so continueth
        flowring, vntill the cold frosts and mistes in the middle or
        end of October, doe checke the luxurious nature thereof, and in
        the meane time the seede is ripe, which will quickly fall downe
        on the ground, where for the most part the best is gathered.


        The Names.

        Some doe reckon this plant among the _Clematides_ or
        _Convolvuli_, the Clamberers or Bindweedes; but (as I said) it
        hath no claspers, neither doth it winde it selfe: but by reason
        of the number of his branches, that run one within another, it
        may seeme to climbe vp by a pole or sticke, which yet doth but
        onely close it, as hauing something whereon to leane or rest
        his branches. Monardus and others call it _Flos sanguineus_,
        of the red spots in the flowers, as also _Mastuerzo de las
        Indias_, which is _Nasturtium Indicum_, by which name it is now
        generally knowne and called, and wee thereafter in English,
        Indian Cresses, yet it may bee called from the forme of the
        flowers onely, Yellow Larkes heeles.


        The Vertues.

        The Spaniards and others vse the leaues hereof in stead of
        ordinary Cresses, because the taste is somewhat sharpe agreeing
        thereunto, but other Physicall properties I haue heard of none
        attributed to it.




CHAP. LII.

_Viola._   Violets.


The Garden Violets (for the Wilde I leaue to their owne place) are so
well knowne vnto all, that either keepe a Garden, or hath but once come
into it, that I shall (I thinke) but lose labour and time to describe
that which is so common. Yet because it is not onely a choise flower
of delight, notwithstanding the popularity, and that I let not passe
anything without his particular description, I must also doe so by
this. And hereunto I must adde that kinde of Violet, which, although
it want that smell of the other, goeth beyond it in variety of dainty
colours, called _Viola tricolor_ _&_ _flammea_, or Harts eases.


1. _Viola simplex Martia._   Single March Violets.

The single Garden Violet hath many round greene leaues, finely snipt
or dented about the edges, standing vpon seuerall small stalkes, set
at diuers places of the many creeping branches, which as they runne,
doe here and there take roote in the ground, bearing thereon many
flowers seuerally at the ioynts of the leaues, which consist of fiue
small leaues, with a short round tayle or spurre behinde, of a perfect
blew purple colour, and of a very sweete sent, it bringeth forth round
seede vessels, standing likewise vpon their seuerall small stalkes,
wherein is contained round white seede: but these heads rise not from
where the flowers grew, as in all other plants that I know, but apart
by themselues, and being sowne, will produce others like vnto it selfe,
whereby there may be made a more speedy encrease to plant a Garden (as
I haue done) or any other place, then by slipping, as is the vsuall
manner: the rootes spread both deepe and wide, taking strong hold in
the ground.

[Sidenote: _Flore albo._]

Of this kinde there is another that beareth white flowers, not
differing in smell or any thing else from the former.

[Sidenote: _Flore obsoleto._]

And also another, that beareth flowers of a dead or sad reddish colour,
in all other things alike, sauing that this hath not altogether so good
a sent as the other.


2. _Viola Martia flore multiplici._   Double March Violets.

There is no difference betweene this Violet and the former, in any
other thing then in the doublenesse of the flowers, which haue so many
leaues set and thrust together, that they are like vnto hard buttons.
There is of this double kinde both white and purple, as in the single;
but the white sort is seldome so thicke and double as the purple: but
of the red colour to be double I neuer heard.


3. _Viola flammea siue tricolor._   Harts eases or Pansies.

The Harts ease hath his leaues longer, and more endented or cut in
on the edges then the Violet hath, and somewhat round withall: the
stalkes are vpright, yet weake, and ready to fall downe, and lye vpon
the ground, set here and there with the like leaues, from whence come
forth the flowers, of little or no sent at all, made like vnto a
Violet, yet more open, and with larger leaues; but so variably mixed
with blew or purple, white and yellow, that it is hard to set downe all
the varieties; For some flowers will be more white, and but some spots
of purple or blew in the two vpper leaues, and the lower leaues with
some stripes of yellow in the middle: others will haue more purple in
them then any other colour, both in the vpper and lower leaues, the
side leaues blew, and the middle yellow, and others white and blew with
yellow stripes, as nature listeth to distribute their colours: the
seede is small, whitish, and round, contained in small round heads: the
roote perisheth euery yeare, and raiseth it selfe vp plentifully by it
owne sowing, if it be suffered.


4. _Viola tricolor flore duplici._   Double Harts ease.

We haue in our Gardens another sort, that beareth flowers with more
leaues then the former, making it seeme to be twice double, and that
onely in Autumne; for the first flowers are single that come in
Summer: This is of that sort that beareth purple flowers: And it is
to be obserued, that the seed of this kinde will not all bring double
flowers, but only some, if the ground be fit and liking, so that if you
haue once had of this double kinde, you shall seldome misse to haue
double flowers againe euery yeare of it owne growing or sowing.


5. _Viola flammea lutea maxima._   The great yellow Pansie.

There is one other kinde of Harts ease, that decketh vp our Gardens not
to be forgotten, whose leaues and flowers are like the former, but more
plentifull in stalkes and branches, and better abideth our Winters;
the flowers are larger then any of the former, of a faire pale yellow
colour, with some yellower stripes now and then about the middle; for
it is sometimes without any stripes; and also of a little deeper yellow
colour: this is to bee encreased by slips, which will soone comprehend
in a moist or moistened ground, for that I neuer could obserue that it
bore seede.


        The Place.

        These plants were first wilde, and by manuring brought to be
        both fairer in colour, and peraduenture of a better sent then
        when they grew wilde.


        The Time.

        The Violets flower in March, and sometimes earlier, and if the
        yeare be temperate and milde, in Autumne againe. The double
        Violets, as they are later before they flower then the single,
        so they hold their flowers longer. The Harts ease flowreth
        seldome vntill May; but then some will abide to flower vntill
        the end of Autumne almost, especially if the frosts be not
        early.


        The Names.

        The Violet is called _Viola nigra_, _purpurea_, and _Martia_:
        In English, Violets, March Violets, and purple Violets. The
        Harts ease is called _Viola flammea_, _Viola tricolor_, _Viola
        multicolor_, and of some, _Iacea_, _Flos trinitatis_, and
        _Herba clauellata_: In English, Harts ease, and Pansies, of
        the French name Pensees. Some giue it foolish names, as Loue
        in idlenesse, Call mee to you, and Three faces in a hood. The
        great yellow Harts ease is so called, because it is like in
        forme, and is the greatest of all other, although it haue not
        that diuersity of colours in it that the other haue.


        The Vertues.

        The properties of Violets are sufficiently knowne to all, to
        coole and moisten: I shall forbeare to recite the many vertues
        that may be set downe, and onely let you knowe, that they haue
        in them an opening or purging quality, being taken either fresh
        and greene, or dryed, and made into powder, especially the
        flowers; the dryed leaues will doe the like, but in greater
        quantity. Costæus in his booke of the nature of all plants
        saith, that the distilled water of Harts ease, is commended
        in the French disease, to be profitable, being taken for nine
        dayes or more, and sweating vpon it, which how true it is, I
        know not, and wish some better experience were made of it,
        before we put any great confidence in that assertion.




CHAP. LIII.

_Epimedium._   Barrenwort.


This pretty plant riseth vp out of the ground with vpright, hard,
round, small stalkes, a foote and a halfe high, or not two foote high
at the highest, diuided into three branches for the most part, each
branch whereof is againe diuided for the most part into three other
branches, and each of them beare three leaues (seldome either more or
lesse) set together, yet each vpon his owne foote-stalke, each leafe
being broad, round, and pointed at the end, somewhat hard or dry in
feeling, hayrie, or as it were prickly about the edges, but very
tenderly, without harme, of a light greene colour on the vpperside, and
a little whiter vnderneath: from the middle of the stemme or stalke of
leaues doth likewise come forth another long stalke, not much higher
then those with the leaues on them, diuided into other branches, each
whereof hath likewise three flowers, each vpon his owne footestalke,
consisting of eight small leaues a peece, yet seeming to be but of
foure leaues spread or layd open flat, for that the foure vppermost,
which are the smaller and being yellow, doe lye so close on the foure
vndermost, which are a little broader and red, that they shew as if
they were yellow flowers with red edges, hauing yellow threds tipt with
greene, standing in the middle of the flowers: the vnderside of the
lower leaues are of a pale yellowish red, striped with white lines:
after the flowers are past, there come small long pods, wherin are
contained flat reddish seede: the rootes are small, reddish and hard,
spreading, branching and enterlacing themselues very much, and is fit
to be placed on some shady side of a garden: the whole plant is rather
of a strong then any good sent, yet is cherished for the pleasant
varietie of the flowers.


        The Place.

        Cæsalpinus saith it groweth on the mountaines of Liguria, that
        is nigh vnto Ligorne, in the Florentine Dominion. Camerarius
        saith, nigh vnto Vicenza in Italie. Bauhinus on the Euganian
        hils, nigh vnto Padoa, and in Romania in shadowie wet grounds.


        The Time.

        It flowreth from Iune vntill the end of Iuly, and to the middle
        of August, if it stand, as I said it is fittest, in a shadowie
        place.


        The Names.

        It is of most Writers accepted for the true _Epimedium_ of
        Dioscorides, though he saith it is without flower or seede,
        being therein eyther mistaken, or mis-informed, as he was also
        in _Dictamnus_ of Candy, and diuers other plants. From the
        triple triplicitie of the standing of the stalkes and leaues,
        and quadriplicitie of the flowers, it might receiue another
        name in English then is already imposed vpon it: but lest I
        might be thought to be singular or full of noueltie, let it
        passe with the name Barrenwort, as it is in the title.


        The Vertues.

        It is thought of diuers to agree in the propertie of causing
        barrennesse, as the ancients doe record of _Epimedium_.




CHAP. LIIII.

_Papauer satiuum._   Garden Poppies.


Of Poppies there are a great many sorts, both wilde and tame, but
because our Garden doth entertaine none, but those of beautie and
respect, I wil onely giue you here a few double ones, and leaue the
rest to a general suruey.

[Illustration:

   1 _Viola Martia simplex._ Single March Violets.
   2 _Viola Martia multiplex._ Double March Violets.

  11 _Nigella duplex flore albo._ Double white Nigella.
  12 _Ptarmica flore pleno._ Double wilde Pelletory.
]


1. _Papauer multiplex album._   Double white Poppies.

The double white Poppy hath diuers broade, and long whitish greene
leaues, giuing milke (as all the rest of the plant aboue ground doth,
wheresoeuer it is broken) very much rent or torne in on the sides,
and notched or indented besides, compassing at the bottome of them a
hard round brittle whitish greene stalke, branched towards the toppe,
bearing one faire large great flower on the head of euery branch, which
before it breaketh out, is contained within a thin skinne, and being
blowne open is very thick of leaues, and double, somewhat iagged at the
ends, and of a white colour, in the middle whereof standeth a round
head or bowle, with a striped crowne on the heade of it, very like a
starre, compassed about with some threds, wherein when it is ripe, is
contained small, round, white seede, disposed into seuerall cels: the
roote is hard wooddy, and long, perishing euery yeare, and must bee new
sowne euery Spring, if they doe not spring of their own sowing, which
if it doe, the flowers are seldome so faire and double as they that are
sowne in the Spring: the whole plant is of a strong heady smell.


2. _Papauer multiplex rubescens._   Double red or blush Poppies.

This other kind of double Poppy differeth not in any other thing from
the former, but only in the colour of the flowers, which are of a
bright red, tending to a blush colour, parted, paned or striped in many
places with white, and exceedingly more iagged then the former, almost
like a feather at the ends, the bottomes of all the leaues being white:
the seede hereof is white as the former, which is not so in any other
Poppie, that beareth not a full white flower.


3. _Papauer multiplex nigrum siue purpureum._
Double purple or murry Poppies.

This kinde varyeth both in flowers and seede, although neyther in
leaues or any other thing from the first: the flowers are thicke and
double, and some what iagged at the ends, in some more, in some lesse,
eyther red or blush, or purplish red, more or lesse, or of a sad murrey
or tawney, with browne, or blacke, or tawny bottomes: the seede is
eyther of a grayish blew colour, or in others more blackish.


4. _Papauer Rhæas flore multiplici._   The double red field Poppie.

This double Poppie is like the wilde or fielde Poppie, which is well
knowne to all to haue longer, narrower, and more iagged greene leaues
then the former, the stalkes more hairy, and the flower of a deepe
yellowish red colour, knowne to all. Now this differeth in nothing from
it, but in the doublenesse of the flower, which is very thicke and
double, but not so large as the former. This riseth of seede in the
like manner as they doe, and so to bee preserued.


        The Place.

        From what place they haue beene first gathered naturally I
        cannot assure you, but we haue had them often and long time
        in our gardens, being sent from Italie and other places. The
        double wilde kindes came from Constantinople, which whether it
        groweth neere vnto it or further off, we cannot tell as yet.


        The Time.

        They flower in the beginning or middle of Iune at the furthest,
        the seede is ripe within a small while after.


        The Names.

        The generall knowne name to all, is _Papauer_, Poppie: the
        seuerall distinctions are according to their colours. Yet our
        English Gentlewomen in some places, call it by a by-name, Ione
        siluer pinne: _subauditur_, Faire without and fowle within.


        The Vertues.

        It is not vnknowne, I suppose to any, that Poppie procureth
        sleepe, for which cause it is wholly and onely vsed as I
        thinke: but the water of the wilde Poppies, besides that
        it is of great vse in Pleurisies, and Rheumatick, or thinne
        Distillations, is found by daily experience, to bee a
        soueraigne remedy against surfeits; yet some doe attribute this
        propertie to the water of the wilde Poppies.




CHAP. LV.

_Nigella._   The Fenell flower, or Nigella.


Among the many sorts of Nigella, both wilde and tame, both single
and double, I will onely set downe three sorts, to be noursed vp in
this garden, referring the rest to a Physicke garden, or a generall
Historie, which may comprehend all.


1. _Nigella Hispanica flore simplici._   The great Spanish Nigella.

Spanish Nigella riseth vp with diuers greene leaues, so finely cut,
and into so many parts, that they are finer then Fenell, and diuided
somewhat like the leaues of Larkes heeles, among which rise vp stalkes,
with many such like leaues vpon them, branched into three or foure
parts, at the toppe of each whereof standeth one faire large flower,
like vnto other single Nigella’s, consisting of fiue or six leaues
sometimes, of a bleake blew, or of a purplish blew colour, with a
greene head in the middle, compassed about with seuen or eight small
blewish greene flowers, or peeces of flowers rather, made like gaping
hoodes, with euery of them a yellowish line thwart or crosse the middle
of them, with some threds also standing by them: after the flower is
past the head groweth greater, hauing sixe, seuen or eight hornes
as it were at the toppe, greater and longer, and standing closer
together then any other Nigella, spreading very like a starre, or the
crowne of the Poppy head, but larger and longer, each whereof being
folded together, openeth a little when the head is ripe, which is
greater aboue, and smaller below, and not so round as the others are,
containing within them small yellowish greene seede, or not so blacke
as the other sorts: the rootes are small and yellow, perishing euery
yeare as the others likewise doe.


2. _Nigella Damascena flore multiplici._
Double blew Nigella, or The Fenell flower.

The double Nigella is in leaues, stalkes and rootes, very like vnto
the former Nigella, so that the one can very hardly bee discerned
from the other before this rise vp to flower, except it be that the
leaues hereof are not fully so large as they: the flower consisteth of
three or foure rowes of leaues, layde one vpon another, of a pale blew
colour, with a greene round head compassed with diuers short threads
in the middle, and hauing fiue or sixe such small greene Fenell-like
leaues vnder the flower, to beare it vp (as it were) below, which adde
a greater grace to the flowers, which at the first sheweth sometimes
white, but changeth quickely after: the horned heads hereof are like
vnto the heads of the other wilde kinde, which are somewhat rounder and
greater, hauing within: them blacke vneuen seedes, but without any sent.


3. _Nigella Citrina flore albo multiplici._   Double white Nigella.

This double white Nigella hath such like leaues as the last hath, but
somewhat larger, of a yellower greene colour, and not so finely cut
and iagged: the flowers are somewhat lesse, and lesser double then
the former, and in colour white, hauing no greene leaues vnder the
flower, as the former hath, the head whereof in the middle is very
like the head of the last double kinde, but not great, wherein is
contained black seede for the most part, and sweete like the Romane
Nigella, which only is sweet besides this: yet sometimes it is not so
blacke, but a little more white or yellowish: the roote is yellow, and
perisheth as the others euery yeare.


        The Place.

        All these, and the rest be found wilde in diuers Countreyes, as
        France, Spaine, Italie, &c. but wee onely cherish them in our
        Gardens for our delight.


        The Time.

        They flower in the end of Iune, and in Iuly, or thereabouts.


        The Names.

        They are called _Melanthium_, _Gith_, and _Nigella_, and of
        some _Flos Diuæ Catherinæ_. We may either call them _Nigella_
        according to the Latine name, or the Fenell flower, as some
        doe, because the double blew Nigella hath small Fenell-like
        leaues bearing vp the flower, as I shewed before in the
        description.


        The Vertues.

        These Nigella’s are nothing so hot in qualitie as the single
        Romane kind is, as may well be knowne by the smell of the seede
        thereof, and therefore are not fit to be vsed in the steed of
        it, as many ignorant persons vse to doe: for the single Romane
        seede is vsed to helpe paines, and cold distillations in the
        head, and to dry vp the rheume. Pena saith, that the pressed
        oyle of the seede as well taken inwardly as vsed outwardly
        is an excellent remedy for the hardnesse and swelling of the
        spleene.




CHAP. LVI.

_Ptarmica siluestris flore pleno._   Double wilde Pelletory.


The double wilde Pelletorie hath straight and slender stalkes, beset
with long and narrow leaues, snipt round about the edges, in all
points like vnto the single wilde kinde, that groweth common with vs
almost euery where: on the toppes of the stalkes stand foure or fiue,
or more white flowers, one aboue another, with a greene leafe at the
bottome of the footestalke of euery one of them, beeing small, thicke,
and very double, with a little yellowishnesse in the middle of euery
flower, like both for forme and colour vnto the flower of the double
Featherfew, but smaller: the rootes are many long strings, running here
and there in the ground: this hath no smell at all, but is delightsome
only for the double white flowers.


        The Place.

        It is only cherished in some few Gardens, for it is very rare.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in the end of Iune or thereabouts.


        The Names.

        It is called of most _Ptarmica_, or _Sternutamentoria_, of his
        qualitie to prouoke neesing: and some _Pyrethrum_, of the hot
        biting taste. We vsually call it double wilde Pelletorie, and
        some Sneesewort, but _Elleborus albus_ is vsually so called,
        and I would not two things should be called by one name, for
        the mistaking and mis-using of them.


        The Vertues.

        The properties hereof, no doubt, may well bee referred to the
        single kinde, beeing of the same qualitie, yet as I take it, a
        little more milde and temperate.




CHAP. LVII.

_Parthenium flore pleno._   Double Featherfew.


Featherfew that beareth double flowers is so like vnto the single
kinde, that the one cannot be discerned from the other, vntill it come
to flower, bearing broad, pale or fresh greene leaues, much cut in on
the sides: the stalkes haue such like leaues on them as grow below,
from the toppes whereof come forth many double white flowers, like vnto
the flowers of the former wilde Pelletory, but larger, and like also
vnto the flowers of the double Camomill: the sent whereof is as strong
as of the single.


        The Place.

        We haue this kinde only in Gardens, and as it is thought by
        others, is peculiar only to our owne Countrey.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in the end of May, and in Iune and Iuly.


        The Names.

        It is called diuersly by diuers: Some thinke it to be
        _Parthenium_ of Dioscorides, but not of Galen; for his
        _Parthenium_ is a sweet herbe, and is thought to bee
        _Amaracus_, that is Marierome: others call it _Matricaria_; and
        some _Amarella_. Gaza translateth it _Muraleum, Theoph. lib. 7.
        cap. 7_. It is generally in these parts of our Country called
        Double Feaverfew, or Featherfew.


        The Vertues.

        It is answerable to all the properties of the single kinde
        which is vsed for womens diseases, to procure their monthly
        courses chiefly. It is held to bee a speciall remedy to helpe
        those that haue taken _Opium_ too liberally. In Italy some
        vse to eate the single kinde among other greene herbes, as
        Camerarius saith, but especially fryed with egges, and so it
        wholly loseth his strong and bitter taste.




CHAP. LVIII.

_Chamæmælum._   Camomill.


Ovr ordinary Camomill is well knowne to all, to haue many smal trayling
branches, set with very fine small leaues, bushing and spreading thicke
ouer the ground, taking roote still as it spreadeth: the toppes of the
branches haue white flowers, with yellow thrummes in the middle, very
like vnto the Featherfew, before described, but somewhat greater, not
so hard, but more soft and gentle in handling, and the whole herbe to
be of a very sweet sent.


1. _Chamæmælum nudum._   Naked Camomill.

We haue another sort of Camomill in some Gardens, but very rare,
like vnto the former, but that it is whiter, finer, and smaller, and
raiseth it selfe vp a little higher, and beareth naked flowers; that
is, without that border of white leaues that is in the former, and
consisteth onely of a yellow round thrummie head, smelling almost as
sweete as the former.


2. _Chamæmælum flore pleno._   Double flowred Camomill.

The double Camomill groweth with his leaues vpon the ground, as the
other single kinde doth, but of a little fresher greene colour, and
larger withall: the stalkes with the flowers on them, doe raise
themselues vp a little higher then the ordinary, and bearing one or
two flowers vpon a stalk, which are composed of many white leaues
set together in diuers rowes, which make a fine double flower, with
a little yellow spot in the middle for the most part of euery one,
and are much larger then any single kinde, smelling better, and more
pleasing then the ordinary: this doth creepe vpon the ground as the
other, but is more tender to be kept in the Winter. Yet if you saue the
flowers hereof (and so will the double Featherfew also) when they haue
stood long, and ready to fade, and keepe them dry vntill the Spring,
and then breaking them or pulling them to peeces, sowe them, there will
spring vp from them Camomill, and also Featherfew, that will againe
beare double flowers.


        The Place.

        Our ordinary Camomill groweth wilde in many places of our
        Country, and as well neare London as in other places. The
        others are onely found in our Gardens, where they are
        cherished. Bauhinus saith, that the double flowred Camomill is
        found wilde about Orleance in France.


        The Time.

        The double kinde is vsually in flower in Iune, before the
        ordinary kinde, and most commonly past before it flowreth,
        which is not vntill Iuly or August. The naked Camomill flowreth
        betweene them both, or later.


        The Names.

        Camomill is called _Anthemis_, _Leucanthemis_, and
        _Leucanthemum_, of the whitenesse of the flowers; and
        _Chamæmælum_ of the corrupted Italian name _Camomilla_.
        Some call the naked Camomill, _Chrysanthemum odoratum_. The
        double Camomill is called by some _Chamæmælum Romanum flore
        multiplici_.


        The Vertues.

        Camomill is put to diuers and sundry vses, both for pleasure
        and profit, both for inward and outward diseases, both for the
        sicke and the sound, in bathings to comfort and strengthen
        the sound, and to ease paines in the diseased, as also in
        many other formes applyed outwardly. The flowers boyled in
        Posset drinke prouoke sweat, and helpe to expell colds, aches,
        and other griefes. A Syrupe made of the iuice of the double
        Camomill, with the flowers and white wine, as Bauhinus saith,
        is vsed by some against the Iaundise and Dropsie, caused by the
        euill disposition of the splene.

CHAP. LIX.

_Pyrethrum officinarum._   Pelletory of Spaine.


I must needes adioyne vnto the Camomils this fine and tender plant,
for some neare resemblance it hath with them in face, though not in
quality. It is a small and lowe plant, bearing many fine greene leaues
vpon his slender branches, which leane or lye down vpon the ground,
diuided into many parts, yet somewhat larger and broader then Camomill,
the stalkes whereof are bigger, and more iuicie then it: the flowers
that stand at the toppes of the stalkes are single, but much larger
then any Camomill flower, hauing a pale or border of many leaues, white
on the vpperside, and reddish vnderneath, set about the yellow middle
thrumme; but not standing so close together ioyning at the bottome,
as the Camomill flowers doe, but more seuered one from another: it
beareth small whitish seede, which is hardly found and discerned from
the chaffe: the roote is long, and growing downe right, of the bignesse
of a mans finger or thumbe in our Countrey, but not half so great where
it groweth naturally, with some fibres and branches from the sides
thereof, of a very hot, sharpe, and biting taste, drawing much water
into the mouth, after it hath been chewed a while: the plant with vs
is very tender, and will hardly or not at all endure the hardnesse and
extremities of our Winters, vnlesse it be very carefully preserued.


        The Place.

        It groweth in Spaine wilde in many places, and in other hot
        Countries, where it may feele no frosts to cause it perish.


        The Time.

        It flowreth so late with vs, that it is not vntill August, that
        oftentimes we cannot gather ripe seedes from it, before it
        perish.


        The Names.

        The name _Pyrethrum_ (taken from πὺρ, that is, _ignis_, fire)
        is giuen to this plant, because of the heate thereof, and
        that the roote is somewhat like in shew, but specially in
        property vnto the true _Pyrethrum_ of Dioscorides, which is an
        vmbelliferous plant, whose rootes are greater, and more feruent
        a great deale, and haue a hayrie bush or toppe as _Meum_, and
        many other vmbelliferous plants haue. It is also called in
        Latin, _Salinaris_, of the effect in drawing much moisture into
        the mouth, to be spit out. We doe vsually call it Pelletory of
        Spaine.


        The Vertues.

        It is in a manner wholly spent to draw rheume from the teeth,
        by chewing it in the mouth, thereby to ease the tooth-ach, and
        likewise from the head, in the paines thereof.




CHAP. LX.

_Flos Adonis flore rubro._   Red Adonis flower.


Adonis flower may well be accounted a kinde of Camomill, although it
hath some especiall differences, hauing many long branches of leaues
lying vpon the ground, and some rising vp with the stalke, so finely
cut and iagged, that they much resemble the leaues of Mayweed, or of
the former _Nigella_: at the top of the stalkes, which rise a foote
high or better, stand small red flowers, consisting of six or eight
round leaues, hauing a greene head in the middle, set about with many
blackish threads, without any smell at all: after the flowers are past,
there grow vp heads with many roundish white seedes at the toppes of
them, set close together, very like vnto the heads of seede of the
great Oxe eye, set downe in the next Chapter, but smaller: the rootes
are small and thready, perishing euery yeare, but rising of his owne
seede againe, many times before Winter, which will abide vntill the
next yeare.

[Sidenote: _Flore luteo._]

Yellow Adonis flower is like vnto the red, but that the flower is
somewhat larger, and of a faire yellow colour.


        The Place.

        The first groweth wilde in the corn fields in many places of
        our own country, as well as in others, and is brought into
        Gardens for the beauties sake of the flower. The yellow is a
        stranger, but noursed in our Gardens with other rarities.


        The Time.

        They flower in May or Iune, as the yeare falleth out to be
        early or late: the seed is soone ripe after, and will quickly
        fall away, if it be not gathered.


        The Names.

        Some haue taken the red kinde to be a kinde of Anemone; other
        to be _Eranthemum_ of Dioscorides: the most vsuall name now
        with vs is _Flos Adonis_, and _Flos Adonidis_: In English,
        where it groweth wilde, they call it red Maythes, as they
        call the Mayweede, white Maythes; and some of our English
        Gentlewomen call it Rosarubie: we vsually call it Adonis flower.


        The Vertues.

        It hath been certainly tryed by experience, that the seed of
        red Adonis flower drunke in wine, is good to ease the paines of
        the Collicke and Stone.




CHAP. LXI.

_Buphthalmum._   Oxe eye.


Vnder the name _Buphthalmum_, or Oxe eye, are comprehended two or three
seueral plants, each differing from other, both in face and property,
yet because they all beare one generall name, I thinke fittest to
comprise them all in one Chapter, and first of that which in leafe &
seed commeth nearest to the Adonis flower.


1. _Buphthalmum maius siue Helleborus niger ferulaceus._
Great Oxe eye, or the yellow Anemone.

This great Oxe eye is a beautifull plant, hauing many branches of
greene leaues leaning or lying vpon the ground for the most part, yet
some standing vpright, which are as fine, but shorter then Fenell; some
of them ending in a small tuft of green leaues, and some hauing at the
toppes of them one large flower a peece, somewhat reddish or brownish
on the outside, while they are in bud, and a while after, and being
open, shew themselues to consist of twelue or fourteene long leaues, of
a faire shining yellow colour, set in order round about a greene head,
with yellow thrums in the middle, laying themselues open in the sunne,
or a faire day, but else remaining close: after the flower is past, the
head growing greater, sheweth it selfe compact of many round whitish
seede, very like vnto the head of seede of the Adonis flower last
described, but much greater: the rootes are many long blackish fibres
or strings, set together at the head, very like vnto the rootes of the
lesser blacke Hellebor or Bearefoote, but somewhat harder, stiffer, or
more brittle, and seeming without moisture in them, which abide and
encrease euery yeare.


2. _Buphthalmum minus, seu Anthemis flore luteo._   Small Oxe eye.

This plant might seeme to be referred to the Camomils, but that it is
not sweete, or to the Corne-Marigolds, but that the stalkes and leaues
are not edible: it is therefore put vnder the Oxe eyes, and so we will
describe it; hauing many weake branches lying vpon the ground, beset
with winged leaues, very finely cut and iagged, somewhat like vnto
Mayweede, but a little larger; the flowers are like vnto the Corne
Marigold, and larger then any Camomill, being wholly yellow, as well
the pale or border of leaues, as the middle thrummes: the rootes are
somewhat tough and long.


3. _Buphthalmum vulgare._   Common Oxe eye.

This Oxe eye riseth vp with hard round stalkes, a foote and a halfe
high, hauing many winged leaues vpon them, made of diuers long and
something broad leaues, snipt about the edges, set together somewhat
like vnto Tansie, but smaller, and not so much winged: the flowers
stand at the toppes of the stalkes, of a full yellow colour, both the
outer leaues and the middle thrum, and not altogether so large as the
last: the rootes of this kinde perish euery yeare, and require a new
sowing againe.


        The Place.

        The first groweth in diuers places of Austria, Bohemia, and
        those parts, it hath beene likewise brought out of Spaine.
        The second in Prouence, a country in France. The last in
        diuers places, as well of Austria as Morauia, and about Mentz
        and Norimberg, as Clusius setteth downe. We haue them in our
        Gardens, but the first is of the greatest respect and beauty.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth betimes, oftentimes in March, or at the
        furthest in Aprill; the seede is ripe in May, and must be
        quickly gathered, lest it bee lost. The other two flower not
        vntill Iune.


        The Names.

        The first is called _Buphthalmum_ of Dodonæus,
        _Pseudohelleborus_ of Matthiolus, _Helleborus niger ferulaceus
        Theophrasti_ by Lobel, of some others _Elleborus niger verus_,
        vsing it for the true blacke Ellebor, but it is much differing,
        as well in face as properties. Of others _Sesamoides minus_.
        Some haue thought it to be a yellow Anemone, that haue looked
        on it without further iudgement, and by that name is most
        vsually knowne to most of our English Gentlewomen that know it.
        But it may most fitly be called a _Buphthalmum_, as Dodonæus
        doth, and _Hispanicum_ or _Austriacum_, for distinctions sake.
        We doe most vsually call it _Helleborus niger ferulaceus_, as
        Lobel doth: Bauhinus calleth it _Helleborus niger tenuifolius
        Buphthalmi flore_. The second is called _Buphthalmum
        Narbonense_: In English, The French, or lesser Oxe eye, as the
        first is called, The great Oxe eye. The last, The common Oxe
        eye.


        The Vertues.

        The first hath been vsed in diuers places for the true blacke
        Ellebor, but now is sufficiently knowne to haue been an errour;
        but what Physicall property hath, other then Matthiolus hath
        expressed, to be vsed as Setterwort for cattell, when they
        rowell them, to put or draw the rootes hereof through the hole
        they make in the dewe lappe, or other places, for their coughes
        or other diseases, I know not, or haue heard or read of any.
        The others likewise haue little or no vse in Physicke now a
        dayes that I know.




CHAP. LXII.

_Chrysanthemum._   Corne Marigold.


Although the sorts of Corne Marigolds, which are many, are fitter for
another then this worke, and for a Catholicke Garden of Simples, then
this of Pleasure and Delight for faire Flowers; yet giue me leaue to
bring in a couple: the one for a corner or by-place, the other for your
choisest, or vnder a defenced wall, in regard of his statelinesse.


1. _Chrysanthemum Creticum._   Corne Marigold of Candy.

This faire Corne Marigold hath for the most part one vpright stalke,
two foote high, whereon are set many winged leaues, at euery ioynt one,
diuided and cut into diuers parts, and they againe parted into seuerall
peeces or leaues: the flowers growe at the toppes of the stalkes,
rising out of a scaly head, composed of ten or twelue large leaues,
of a faire, but pale yellow colour, and more pale almost white at the
bottome of the leaues, round about the yellow thrumme in the middle,
being both larger and sweeter then any of the other Corne Marigolds:
the seede is whitish and chaffie: the roote perisheth euery yeare.


2. _Chrysanthemum Perüuianum, siue Flos Solis._
The golden flower of Peru, or the Flower of the Sunne.

This goodly and stately plant, wherewith euery one is now a dayes
familiar, being of many sorts, both higher and lower (with one stalke,
without branches, or with many branches, with a blacke, or with a
white seede, yet differing not in forme of leaues or flowers one from
another, but in the greatnesse or smalnesse) riseth vp at the first
like vnto a Pompion with two leaues, and after two, or foure more
leaues are come forth, it riseth vp into a great stalke, bearing the
leaues on it at seuerall distances on all sides thereof, one aboue
another vnto the very toppe, being sometimes, and in some places,
seuen, eight, or ten foote high, which leaues standing out from the
stemme or stalke vpon their seuerall great ribbed foote-stalkes, are
very large, broad belowe, and pointed at the end, round, hard, rough,
of a sad greene colour, and bending downewards: at the toppe of the
stalke standeth one great, large, and broad flower, bowing downe the
head vnto the Sunne, and breaking forth from a great head, made of
scaly greene leaues, like vnto a great single Marigold, hauing a border
of manie long yellow leaues, set about a great round yellow thrumme, as
it were in the middle, which are very like vnto short heads of flowers,
vnder euery one whereof there is a seede, larger then any seede of the
Thistles, yet somewhat like, and lesser, and rounder then any Gourd
seede, set in so close and curious a manner, that when the seede is
taken out, the head with the hollow places or cels thereof seemeth very
like vnto an hony combe; which seede is in some plants very blacke, in
the hotter countries, or very white, and great, or large, but with
vs is neither so large, blacke, or white; but sometimes blackish or
grayish. Some sort riseth not vp halfe the height that others doe,
and some againe beare but one stemme or stalke, with a flower at the
toppe thereof; and others two or three, or more small branches, with
euery one his flower at the end; and some so full of branches from the
very ground almost, that I haue accounted threescore branches round
about the middle stalke of one plant, the lowest neare two yards long,
others aboue them a yard and a halfe, or a yard long, with euery one
his flower thereon; but all smaller then those that beare but one or
two flowers, and lesser also for the most part then the flower on the
middle stalke it selfe. The whole plant, and euery part thereof aboue
ground hath a strong resinous sent of Turpentine, and the heads and
middle parts of the flowers doe oftentimes (and sometimes the ioynts of
the stalke where the leaues stand) sweat out a most fine thin & cleare
Rossin or Turpentine, but in small quantity, and as it were in drops,
in the heate and dry time of the year, so like both in colour, smell,
and taste vnto cleare Venice Turpentine, that it cannot be knowne
from it: the roote is strongly fastened in the ground by some greater
roots branching out, and a number of small strings, which growe not
deepe, but keepe vnder the vpper crust of the earth, and desireth much
moisture, yet dyeth euery yeare with the first frosts, and must be new
sowne in the beginning of the Spring.


        The Place.

        Their places are set downe in their titles, the one to come out
        of Candy, the other out of Peru, a Prouince in the West Indies.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth in Iune, the other later, as not vntill
        August, and sometimes so late, that the early frosts taking it,
        neuer suffer it to come to ripeness.


        The Names.

        The first hath his name in his title. The second, besides the
        names set downe, is called of some _Planta maxima_, _Flos
        maximus_, _Sol Indianus_, but the most vsuall with vs is, _Flos
        Solis_: In English, The Sunne Flower, or Flower of the Sunne.


        The Vertues.

        There is no vse of either in Physicke with vs, but that
        sometimes the heads of the Sunne Flower are dressed, and eaten
        as Hartichokes are, and a accounted of some to be good meate,
        but they are too strong for my taste.




CHAP. LXIII.

_Calendula._   Marigolds.


Some haue reckoned vp many sorts of Marigolds, I had rather make but
two, the single and the double; for doubtlesse, those that be most
double, rise from the best seede, which are the middlemost of the great
double, and some would be lesse double, whose seede is greater then the
rest, according to the ground where it groweth; as also those that be
of a paler colour, doe come of the seed of the yellower sort.

]


1. _Calendula maxima._   The great Garden Marigold.

Garden Marigold hath round greene stalkes, branching out from the
ground into many parts, whereon are set long flat greene leaues,
broader and rounder at the point then any where else, and smaller
also at the setting to of the stalke, where it compasseth it about: the
flowers are sometimes very thicke and double (breaking out of a scaly
clammy greene head) composed of many rowes of leaues, set so close
together one within another, that no middle thrume can bee seene, and
sometimes lesse double, hauing a small browne spot of a thrume in the
middle: and sometimes but of two or three rowes of leaues, with a large
browne thrume in the middle; euery one whereof is somewhat broader
at the point, and nicked into two or three corners, of an excellent
faire deepe gold yellow colour in some, and paler in others, and of a
pretty strong and resinous sweete sent: after the flowers are past,
there succeede heads of crooked seede, turning inward, the outermost
biggest, and the innermost least: the roote is white, and spreadeth in
the ground, and in some places will abide after the seeding, but for
the most part perisheth, and riseth againe of his owne seede. Sometimes
this Marigold doth degenerate, and beareth many small flowers vpon
short stalkes, compassing the middle flower: but this happeneth but
seldome, and therefore accounted but _lusus naturæ_, a play of nature,
which she worketh in diuers other plants besides.


2. _Calendula simplex._   The single Marigold.

There is no difference betweene this and the former, but that the
flowers are single, consisting of one rowe of leaues, of the same
colour; eyther paler or deeper yellow, standing about a great browne
thrumme in the middle: the seed likewise is alike, but for the most
part greater then in the double kindes.


        The Place.

        Our Gardens are the chiefe places for the double flowers to
        grow in; for we know not of any other naturall place: but the
        single kinde hath beene found wilde in Spaine, from whence I
        receiued seede, gathered by Guillaume Boel, in his time a very
        curious, and cunning searcher of simples.


        The Time.

        They flower all the Summer long, and sometimes euen in winter,
        if it be milde, and chiefly at the beginning of those monethes,
        as it is thought.


        The Names.

        They are called _Caltha_ of diuers, and taken to be that
        _Caltha_, whereof both Virgil and Columella haue written.
        Others doe call them _Calendula_, of the Kalendes, that is the
        first day of the monthes, wherein they are thought chiefly to
        flower; and thereupon the Italians call them _Fiori di ogni
        mese_, that is, The Flowers of euery moneth: We cal them in
        English generally, eyther Golds, or Marigolds.


        The Vertues.

        The herbe and flowers are of great vse with vs among other
        pot-herbes, and the flowers eyther greene or dryed, are often
        vsed in possets, broths, and drinkes, as a comforter of the
        heart and spirits, and to expel any malignant or pestilential
        quality, gathered neere thereunto. The Syrupe and Conserue made
        of the fresh flowers are vsed for the same purposes to good
        effect.




CHAP. LXIIII.

_Aster._   Starre-wort.


Dioscorides and other of the ancient Writers, haue set forth but one
kinde of Starre-wort, which they call _Aster Atticus_, of the place no
doubt, where the greatest plentie was found, which was the Countrey of
Athens: the later Writers haue found out many other plants which they
referre to this kinde, calling them by the same name. It is not my
purpose to entreate of them all, neyther doth this garden fitly agree
with them; I shall therefore select out one or two from the rest, and
giue the knowledge of them, leauing the rest to their proper place.


1. _Aster Atticus flore luteo._   Yellow Starre-wort.

This Starre-wort riseth vp with two or three rough hairy stalkes, a
foote and a halfe high, with long, rough or hairie, brownish, darke
greene leaues on them, diuided into two or three branches: at the toppe
of euery one whereof standeth a flat scaly head, compared vnderneath
with fiue or sixe long, browne, rough greene leaues, standing like a
Starre, the flower it selfe standing in the middle thereof, made as a
border of narrow, long, pale yellow leaues, set with a brownish yellow
thrume: the roote dyeth euery yeare, hauing giuen his flower.


2. _Aster Atticus Italorum flore purpureo._
Purple Italian Starre-wort.

This Italian Starre-wort hath many wooddy, round brittle stalkes,
rising from the roote, somewhat higher then the former, sometimes
standing vpright, and otherwhiles leaning downewards, whereon are set
many somewhat hard, and rough long leaues, round pointed, without order
vp to the toppe, where it is diuided into seuerall branches, whereon
stand the flowers, made like vnto a single Marigold, with a border of
blewish purple leaues, set about a browne middle thrume, the heads
sustaining the flowers are composed of diuers scaly greene leaues, as
is to be seene in the Knapweedes or Matfelons, which after the flowers
are past yeelde a certaine downe, wherein lye small blacke and flat
seedes, somewhat like vnto Lettice seede, which are carried away with
the winde: the roote is composed of many white strings, which perisheth
not as the former, but abideth, and springeth afresh euery yeare.


        The Place.

        The first is found in Spaine, as Clusius, and in France,
        as Lobel say. The other hath beene found in many places in
        Germany, and Austria: in Italie also, and other places; we haue
        it plentifully in our Gardens.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth in Summer. And the other not vntill August
        or September.


        The Names.

        The first is called _Aster Atticus flore luteo_, _Bubonium_,
        _&_ _Inguinalis_, and of many is taken to be the true _Aster
        Atticus_ of Dioscorides: yet Matthiolus thinketh not so, for
        diuers good reasons, which hee setteth downe in the Chapter
        of _Aster Atticus_, as any man may vnderstand, if they will
        but reade the place, which is too long to bee inserted here.
        The other is thought by Matthiolus, to bee the truer _Aster
        Atticus_, (vnto whom I must also consent) and constantly also
        affirmed to be the _Amellus Virgilij_, as may be seene in
        the same place: but it is usually called at this day, _Aster
        Italorum flore cæruleo_ or _purpureo_. Their English names are
        sufficiently expressed in their titles, yet some call the last,
        The purple Marigold, because it is so like vnto one in form.


        The Vertues.

        They are held, if they bee the right, to bee good for the
        biting of a mad dogge, the greene herbe being beaten with old
        hogs grease, and applyed; as also for swolne throats: It is
        likewise vsed for botches that happen in the groine, as the
        name doth import.




CHAP. LXV.

_Pilosella maior._   Golden Mouse-eare.


Some resemblance that the flowers of this plant hath with the former
Golds, maketh me to insert it in this place, although I know it agreeth
not in any other part, yet for the pleasant aspect thereof, it must
bee in this my garden, whose description is as followeth: It hath many
broade greene leaues spread vpon the ground, spotted with pale spots,
yet more conspicuous at sometimes then at other; somewhat hairy both
on the vpper and vnderside, in the middle of these leaues rise vp one,
two or more blackish hairy stalkes, two foote high at the least, bare
or naked vp to the top, where it beareth an vmbell, or short tuft of
flowers, set close together vpon short stalkes, of the forme or fashion
of the Haukeweedes, or common Mouse-eare, but somewhat smaller, of a
deep gold yellow, or orenge tawney colour, with some yellow threds in
the middle, of little or no sent at all: after the flowers are past,
the heads carry small, short, blacke seede, with a light downie matter
on them, ready to bee carried away with the winde, as many other plants
are, when they be ripe: the rootes spread vnder ground, and shoote vp
in diuers other places, whereby it much encreaseth, especially if it be
set in any moist or shadowie place.


        The Place.

        It groweth in the shadowie woods of France, by Lions, and
        Mompelier, as Lobell testifieth: we keepe it in our gardens,
        and rather in a shadowie then sunnie place.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in Somer, and sometimes againe in September.


        The Names.

        It is called by Lobell, _Pulmonaria Gallorum Hieratij
        facie_: and the Herbarists of France take it to be the true
        _Pulmonaria_ of Tragus. Others call it _Hieratium flore aureo_.
        Pelleterius _Hieratium Indicum_. Some _Pilosella_, or _Auricula
        muris maior flore aureo_. And some _Chondrilla flore aureo_.
        Dalechamptus would haue it to bee _Corchorus_, but farre
        vnfitly. The fittest English name we can giue it, is Golden
        Mouse-eare, which may endure vntill a fitter bee imposed on it:
        for the name of Grim the Collier, whereby it is called of many,
        is both idle and foolish.


        The Vertues.

        The French according to the name vse it for the defects of the
        lunges, but with what good successe I know not.




CHAP. LXVI.

_Scorsonera._   Vipers grasse.


Although there be foure or fiue sorts of _Scorsonera_, yet I shall here
desire you to be content with the knowledge only of a couple.


1. _Scorsonera Hispanica maior._   The greater Spanish Vipers grasse.

This Spanish Vipers grasse hath diuers long, and somewhat broad leaues,
hard and crumpled on the edges, and sometimes vneuenly cut in or
indented also, of a blewish greene colour: among which riseth vp one
stalke, and no more for the most part, two foote high or thereabouts,
hauing here and there some narrower long leaues thereon then those
below: the toppe of the stalke brancheth it selfe forth into other
parts, euery one bearing a long scaly head, from out of the toppe
whereof riseth a faire large double flower, of a pale yellow colour,
much like vnto the flower of yellow Goates beard, but a little lesser,
which being past, the seede succeedeth, being long, whitish and rough,
inclosed with much downe, and among them many other long smooth seedes,
which are limber and idle, and are carryed away at the will of the
winde: the roote is long, thicke and round, brittle and blacke, with
a certaine roughnesse on the outside: but very white within, yeelding
a milkie liquor being broken, as euery other part of the plant doth
besides, yet the roote more then any other part, and abideth many
yeares without perishing.


2. _Scorsonera Pannonica purpurea._   Purple flowred Vipers grasse.

This purple flowred Vipers grasse hath long and narrow leaues, of
the same blewish greene colour with the former: the stalke riseth vp
a foote and a halfe high, with a few such like leaues, but shorter
thereon, breaking at the toppe into two or three parts, bearing on each
of them one flower, fashioned like the former, and standing in the like
scaly knoppe or head, but of a blewish purple colour, not fully so
large, of the sweetest sent of any of this kinde, comming neerest vnto
the smell of a delicate perfume.


        The Place.

        The first is of Spaine. The other of Hungarie and Austrich:
        which now furnish our gardens.


        The Time.

        They flower in the beginning of May: the seede is soone ripe
        after, and then perishing downe to the roote for that yeare,
        springeth afresh before Winter againe.


        The Names.

        They are called after the Spanish name _Scorsonera_, which is
        in Latine _Viperaria_, of some _Viperina_, and _Serpentina_:
        Wee call them in English Vipers grasse, or _Scorsonera_.


        The Vertues.

        Manardus as I thinke first wrote hereof, and saith that it hath
        been found to cure them that are bitten of a Viper, or other
        such like venemous Creature. The rootes hereof being preserued
        with sugar, as I haue done often, doe eate almost as delicate
        as the Eringus roote, and no doubt is good to comfort and
        strengthen the heart, and vitall spirits. Some that haue vsed
        the preserued roote haue found it effectuall to expelling winde
        out of the stomacke, and to helpe swounings and faintnesse of
        the heart.




CHAP. LXVII.

_Tragopogon._   Goates beard.


I must in this place set downe but two sorts of Goates beards; the
one blew or ash-colour, the other red or purple, and leaue the other
kindes: some to bee spoken of in the Kitchin Garden, and others in a
Physicall Garden.


1. _Tragopogon flore cæruleo._   Blew Goates beard.

All the Goates beards haue long, narrow, and somewhat hollow whitish
greene leaues, with a white line downe the middle of euery one on the
vpperside: the stalke riseth vp greater and stronger then the Vipers
grasse, bearing at the toppe a great long head or huske, composed of
nine or ten long narrow leaues, the sharpe points or ends whereof rise
vp aboue the flower in the middle, which is thicke and double, somewhat
broad and large spread, of a blewish ash-colour, with some whitish
threads among them, shutting or closing it selfe within the greene
huske euery day, that it abideth blowing, vntill about noone, and
opening not it selfe againe vntill the next morning: the head or huske,
after the flower is past, and the seede neare ripe, openeth it selfe;
the long leaues thereof, which closed not before now, falling downe
round about the stalke, and shewing the seede, standing at the first
close together, and the doune at the toppe of them: but after they haue
stood a while, it spreadeth it selfe round, and is ready to be carried
away with the winde, if it be not gathered: the seede it selfe is long,
round, and rough, like the seede of the Vipers grasse, but greater and
blacker: the roote is long, and not very great, but perisheth as soone
as it hath borne seede, and springeth of the fallen seede, that yeare
remaining greene all Winter, and flowring the next yeare following:
the whole yeeldeth milke as the former, but somewhat more bitter and
binding.


2. _Tragopogon purpureum._   Purple Goates beard.

There is little difference in this kind from the former, but that it
is a little larger, both in the leafe, and head that beareth the seed:
the flowers also are a little larger, and spread more, of a darke
reddish purple colour, with some yellow dust as it were cast vpon it,
especially about the ends: the roote perisheth in the like manner as
the other.


        The Place.

        Both these haue been sent vs from the parts beyond the Seas, I
        haue had them from Italy, where no doubt they grow naturally
        wilde, as the yellow doth with vs: they are kept in our Gardens
        for their pleasant flowers.


        The Time.

        They flower in May and Iune: the seede is ripe in Iuly.


        The Names.

        Their generall name is after the Greeke word _Tragopogon_,
        which is in Latine, _Barbahirci_: In English, Goates beard;
        the head of seede when it is readie to bee carried away with
        the winde, causing that name for the resemblance: and because
        the flower doth euery day close it selfe at noone (as I said
        before) and openeth not againe vntill the next Sunne, some haue
        fitly called it, Goe to bed at noone.


        The Vertues.

        The rootes of these kindes are a little more bitter and more
        binding also then the yellow kinde expressed in the Kitchin
        Garden; and therefore fitter for medicine then for meate, but
        yet is vsed as the yellow kinde is, which is more fit for meate
        then medicine. The distilled water is good to wash old sores
        and wounds.




CHAP. LXVIII.

_Flos Africanus._   The French Marigold.


Of the French or African Marigolds there are three kindes as
principall, and of each of them both with single and double flowers:
of these, some diuersity is obserued in the colour of the flowers, as
well as in the forme or largenesse, so that as you may here see, I
haue expressed eight differences, and Fabius Columna nine or ten, in
regard hee maketh a diuersity of the paler and deeper yellow colour:
and although the lesser kinde, because of its euill sent, is held
dangerous, yet for the beauty of the flower it findeth roome in Gardens.


1. _Flos Africanus maior siue maximus multiplex._
The great double French Marigold.

This goodly double flower, which is the grace and glory of a Garden
in the time of his beauty, riseth vp with a straight and hard round
greene stalke, hauing some crests or edges all along the stalke, beset
with long winged leaues, euery one whereof is like vnto the leafe of
an Ash, being composed of many long and narrow leaues, snipt about
the edges, standing by couples one against another, with an odde one
at the end, of a darke or full greene colour: the stalke riseth to
be three or foure foote high, and diuideth it selfe from the middle
thereof into many branches, set with such like leaues to the toppes
of them, euery one bearing one great double flower, of a gold yellow
colour aboue, and paler vnderneath, yet some are of a pale yellow, and
some betweene both, and all these rising from one and the same seede:
the flower, before it be blowne open, hath all the leaues hollow; but
when it is full blowne open, it spreadeth it selfe larger then any
Prouince Rose, or equall vnto it at the least, if it be in good earth,
and riseth out of a long greene huske, striped or furrowed, wherein
after the flower is past, (which standeth in his full beauty a moneth,
and oftentimes more, and being gathered, may be preserued in his full
beauty for two moneths after, if it be set in water) standeth the
seede, set thicke and close together vpright, which is blacke, somewhat
flat and long: the roote is full of small strings, whereby it strongly
comprehendeth in the ground: the flower of this, as well as the single,
is of the very smell of new waxe, or of an honie combe, and not of that
poisonfull sent of the smaller kindes.


2. _Flos Africanus maior simplex._   The great single French Marigold.

This single Marigold is in all things so like vnto the former, that it
is hard to discerne it from the double, but by the flowers, onely the
stalke will be browner then the double; and to my best obseruation,
hath and doth euery yeare rise from the seede of the double flower:
so that when they are in flower, you may see the difference (or not
much before, when they are in bud) this single flower euer appearing
with thrums in the middle, and the leaues, which are the border or
pale standing about them, shewing hollow or fistulous, which after lay
themselues flat and open (and the double flower appearing with all his
leaues folded close together, without any thrum at all) and are of a
deeper or paler colour, as in the double.


3. _Flos Africanus fistuloso flore simplex_ & _multiplex_. Single and
double French Marigolds with hollow leafed flowers.

As the former two greatest sorts haue risen from the seede of one
and the same (I meane the pod of double flowers) so doe these also,
not differing from it in anything, but that they are lower, and haue
smaller greene leaues, and that the flower also being smaller, hath
euery leafe abiding hollow, like vnto an hollow pipe, broad open at
the mouth, and is of as deepe a yellow colour for the most part as the
deepest of the former, yet sometimes pale also.


4. _Flos Africanus minor multiplex._
The lesser double French Marigold.

The lesser double French Marigold hath his leaues in all things like
vnto the former, but somewhat lesser, which are set vpon round browne
stalkes, not so stiffe or vpright, but bowing and bending diuers
wayes, and sometimes leaning or lying vpon the ground: the stalkes are
branched out diuersly, whereon are set very faire double flowers like
the former, and in the like greene huskes, but smaller, and in some the
outermost leaues will be larger then any of the rest, and of a deeper
Orenge colour, almost crimson, the innermost being of a deepe gold
yellow colour, tending to crimson; the whole flower is smaller, and of
a stronger and more vnpleasant sauour, so that but for the beautifull
colour, and doublenesse of the flower, pleasant to the eye, and not
to any other sense, this kinde would finde roome in few Gardens: the
rootes and seedes are like the former, but lesser.


5. _Flos Africanus minor simplex._   The small single French Marigold.

This single kinde doth follow after the last in all manner of
proportion, both of stalkes, leaues, seedes, and rootes: the flowers
onely of this are single, hauing fiue or six broad leaues, of a deepe
yellow crimson colour, with deepe yellow thrummes in the middle, and of
as strong a stinking sent, or more then the last.


        The Place.

        They growe naturally in Africa, and especially in the parts
        about Tunis, and where old Carthage stood, from whence long
        agoe they were brought into Europe, where they are onely kept
        in Gardens, being sowne for the most part euery yeare, vnlesse
        in some milde Winters. The last single and double kindes (as
        being more hardy) haue sometimes endured: but that kinde with
        hollow leafed flowers, as Fabius Columna setteth it downe, is
        accounted to come from Mexico in America.


        The Time.

        They flower not vntill the end of Summer, especially the
        greater kindes: but the lesser, if they abide all the Winter,
        doe flower more early.


        The Names.

        They haue been diuersly named by diuers men: Some calling
        them _Caryophyllus Indicus_, that is, Indian Gilloflowers,
        and _Tanacetum Perüvianum_, Tansie of Peru, as if it grew in
        Peru, a Prouince of America; and _Flos Indicus_, as a flower of
        the Indies; but it hath not been knowne to haue beene brought
        from thence. Others would haue it to be _Othonna_ of Plinie,
        and others; some to be _Lycopersicum_ of Galen. It is called,
        and that more truely, _Flos Tunetensis_, _Flos Africanus_,
        and _Caltha Africana_, that is, the flower of Tunis, the
        flower of Africa, the Marigold of Africa, and peraduenture
        _Pedna Pænorum_. We in English most vsually call them, French
        Marigolds, with their seuerall distinctions of greater or
        smaller, double or single. To that with hollow leafed flowers,
        Fabius Columna giueth the name of _Fistiloso flore_, and I so
        continue it.

CHAP. LXIX.

_Caryophyllus hortensis._   Carnations and Gilloflowers.


To auoide confusion, I must diuide Gilloflowers from Pinkes, and
intreate of them in seuerall Chapters. Of those that are called
Carnations or Gilloflowers, as of the greater kinde, in this Chapter;
and of Pinkes, as well double as single, in the next. But the number of
them is so great, that to giue seuerall descriptions to them all were
endlesse, at the least needlesse: I will therefore set downe onely the
descriptions of three (for vnto these three may be referred all the
other sorts) for their fashion and manner of growing, and giue you the
seuerall names (as they are vsually called with vs) of the rest, with
their variety and mixture of colours in the flowers, wherein consisteth
a chiefe difference. I account those that are called Carnations to
be the greatest, both for leafe and flower, and Gilloflowers for the
most part to bee lesser in both; and therefore will giue you each
description apart, and the Orenge tawnie or yellow Gilloflower likewise
by it selfe, as differing very notably from all the rest.


1. _Caryophyllus maximus Harwicensis siue Anglicus._
The great Harwich or old English Carnation.

I take this goodly great old English Carnation, as a president for the
description of all the rest of the greatest sorts, which for his beauty
and statelinesse, is worthy of a prime place, hauing beene alwayes
very hardly preserued in the Winter; and therefore not so frequent as
the other Carnations or Gilloflowers. It riseth vp with a great thicke
round stalke, diuided into seuerall branches, somewhat thickly set with
ioynts, and at euery ioynt two long greene rather then whitish leaues,
somewhat broader then Gilloflower leaues, turning or winding two or
three times round (in some other sorts of Carnations they are plaine,
but bending the points downewards, and in some also of a darke reddish
greene colour, and in others not so darke, but rather of a whitish
greene colour:) the flowers stand at the toppes of the stalkes in long,
great, and round greene huskes, which are diuided into fiue points,
out of which rise many long and broad pointed leaues, deeply iagged at
the ends, set in order round and comely, making a gallant great double
flower, of a deepe Carnation colour, almost red, spotted with many
blush spots and strakes, some greater and some lesser, of an excellent
soft sweete sent, neither too quicke as many others of these kinds are,
nor yet too dull, and with two whitish crooked threads like hornes in
the middle: this kinde neuer beareth many flowers, but as it is slow in
growing, so in bearing, not to be often handled, which sheweth a kinde
of statelinesse, fit to preserue the opinion of magnificence: the roote
is branched into diuers great, long, wooddy rootes, with many small
fibres annexed vnto them.


2. _Caryophyllus hortensis flore pleno rubro._
The red or Cloue Gilloflower.

The red Cloue Gilloflower, which I take as a president for the second
sort, which are Gilloflowers, grow like vnto the Carnations, but not
so thicke set with ioynts and leaues: the stalkes are more, the leaues
are narrower and whiter for the most part, and in some doe as well a
little turne: the flowers are smaller, yet very thicke and double in
most, and the greene huskes wherein they stand are smaller likewise
then the former: the ends of the leaues in this flower, as in all the
rest, are dented or iagged, yet in some more then in others; some also
hauing two small white threads, crooked at the ends like hornes,in the
middle of the flower, when as diuers other haue none. These kindes,
and especially this that hath a deepe red crimson coloured flower, doe
endure the cold of our winters, and with lesse care is preserued: these
sorts as well as the former doe very seldome giue any seede, as far as
I could euer obserue or learne.

]


3. _Caryophyllus Silesiacus flore pleno miniato._
The yellow or Orenge tawny Gilloflower.

This Gilloflower hath his stalkes next vnto the ground, thicker set,
and with smaller or narrower leaues then the former for the most part:
the flowers are like vnto the Cloue Gilloflowers, and about the same
bignesse and doublenesse most vsually, yet in some much greater then
in others; but of a pale yellowish Carnation colour, tending to an
Orenge, with two small white threds, crooked at the ends in the middle,
yet some haue none, of a weaker sent then the Cloue Gilloflower: this
kinde is more apt to beare seede then any other, which is small, black,
flat, and long, and being sowen, yeelde wonderfull varieties both of
single and double flowers: some being of a lighter or deeper colour
then the mother plants: some with stripes in most of the leaues: Others
are striped or spotted, like a speckled Carnation or Gilloflower, in
diuers sorts, both single and double: Some againe are wholly of the
same colour, like the mother plant, and are eyther more or lesse double
then it, or else are single with one row of leaues, like vnto a Pinck;
and some of these likewise eyther wholly of a crimson red, deeper or
lighter, or variably spotted, double or single as a Pinck, or blush
eyther single or double, and but very seldome white: yet all of them in
their greene leaues little or nothing varying or differing.


_Caryophylli maximi._

        CARNATIONS.

_Caryophyllus maximus dictus Hulo rubro-varius._

        The gray _Hulo_ hath as large leaues as the former old
        Carnation, and as deepely iagged on the edges: it hath a great
        high stalke, whereon stand the flowers, of a deepe red colour,
        striped and speckled very close together with a darkish white
        colour.

_Caryophyllus maximus dictus Hulo ruber non variatus._

        The red _Hulo_ is also a faire great flower, of a stamell
        colour, deeply iagged as the former, and groweth very comely
        without any spot at all in it, so that it seemeth to bee but a
        stamell Gilloflower, saue that it is much greater.

_Caryophyllus maximus dictus Hulo cæruleo purpureus._

        The blew _Hulo_ is a goodly faire flower, being of a faire
        purplish murrey colour, curiously marbled with white, but so
        smally to be discerned, that it seemeth only purple, it hath so
        much the Mastrie in it; it resembleth the Brassill, but that it
        is much bigger.

_Caryophyllus maximus dictus Grimelo siue Princeps._

        The _Grimelo_ or Prince is a faire flower also, as large as any
        Chrystall or larger, being of a faire crimson colour, equally
        for the most part striped with white, or rather more white then
        red, thorough euery leafe from the bottome, and standeth comely.

_Caryophyllus maximus Incarnadinus albus._

        The white Carnation or Delicate, is a goodly delightfull fair
        flower in his pride and perfection, that is, when it is both
        marbled and flaked, or striped and speckled with white vpon
        an incarnate crimson colour, beeing a very comely flower, but
        abideth not constant, changing oftentimes to haue no flakes or
        strakes of white, but marbled or speckled wholly.

_Caryophyllus maximus Incarnadinus Gallicus._

        The French Carnation is very like vnto the white Carnation, but
        that it hath more specks, and fewer stripes or flakes of white
        in the red, which hath the mastrie of the white.

_Caryophyllus maximus Incarnadinus grandis._

        The ground Carnation (if it be not the same with the graund
        or great old Carnation first set downe, as the alteration but
        of one letter giueth the coniecture) is a thicke flower, but
        spreadeth not his leaues abroade as others doe, hauing the
        middle standing higher then the outer leaues, and turning vp
        their brimmes or edges; it is a sad flower, with few stripes
        or spots in it: it is very subiect to breake the pod, that the
        flower seldome commeth faire and right; the greene leaues are
        as great as the _Hulo_ or Lombard red.

_Caryophyllus maximus Chrystallinus._

        The Chrystall or Chrystalline (for they are both one, howsoeuer
        some would make them differ) is a very delicate flower when
        it is well marked, but it is inconstant in the markes, being
        sometimes more striped with white and crimson red, and
        sometimes lesse or little or nothing at all, and changing also
        sometimes to be wholly red, or wholly blush.

_Caryophyllus maximus flore rubro._

        The red Chrystall, which is the red hereof changed, is the most
        orient flower of all other red Gilloflowers, because it is both
        the greatest, as comming from the Chrystall, as also that the
        red hereof is a most excellent crimson.

_Caryophyllus maximus dictus Fragrans._

        The Fragrant is a faire flower, and thought to come from the
        Chrystall, being as large, but of a blush red colour, spotted
        with small speckes, no bigger then pinnes points, but not so
        thicke as in the Pageant.

_Caryophyllus maximus Sabaudicus varius._

        The stript Sauadge is for forme and bignesse equall with the
        Chrystall or White Carnation, but as inconstant as eyther of
        them, changing into red or blush, so that few branches with
        flowers containe their true mixtures, which are a whitish
        blush, fairely striped with a crimson red colour, thicke and
        short, with some spots also among.

_Caryophyllus maximus Sabaudicus carneus._

        The blush Sauadge is the same with the former, the same root of
        the stript Sauadge, as I said before, yeelding one side or part
        whose flowers will be eyther wholly blush, or hauing some small
        spots, or sometimes few or none in them.

_Caryophyllus maximus Sabaudicus ruber._

        The red Sauadge is as the blush, when the colour of the flower
        is wholly red without any stripes or spots in them, and so
        abideth long; yet it is sometimes seene, that the same side, or
        part, or roote being separate from the first or mother plant,
        will giue striped and well marked flowers againe.

_Caryophyllus maximus Oxoniensis._

        The Oxeford Carnation is very like vnto the French Carnation,
        both for forme, largenesse and colour; but that this is of a
        sadder red colour, so finely marbled with white thereon, that
        the red hauing the maistry, sheweth a very sad flower, not
        hauing any flakes or stripes at all in it.

_Caryophyllus maximus Regius, siue Bristoliensis maior._

        The Kings Carnation or ordinary Bristow, is a reasonable great
        flower, deepely iagged, of a sad red, very finally striped and
        speckled with white: some of the leaues of the flower on the
        one side will turne vp their brimmes or edges: the greene leafe
        is very large.

_Caryophyllus maximus Granatensis._

        The greatest _Granado_ is a very faire large flower, bigger
        then the Chrystall, and almost as bigge as the blew _Hulo_; it
        is almost equally diuided and stript with purple and white,
        but the purple is sadder then in the ordinary _Granado_
        Gilloflower, else it might bee said it were the same, but
        greater. Diuers haue taken this flower to bee the _Gran Pere_,
        but you shall haue the difference shewed you in the next
        ensuing flower.

_Caryophyllus maximus Gran Pere dictus._

        The _Gran Pere_ is a fair great flower, and comely for the
        forme, but of no great beautie for colour, because although it
        be stript red and white like the Queenes gilloflower, yet the
        red is so sad that it taketh away all the delight to the flower.

_Caryophyllus maximus Cambersine dictus._

        The Cambersine is a great flower and a faire, beeing a redde
        flower, well marked or striped with white, somewhat like vnto
        a Sauadge, say some, but that the red is not crimson as the
        Sauadge; others say the Daintie, but not so comely: the leaues
        of the flowers are many, and thrust together, without any due
        forme of spreading.

_Caryophyllus maximus Longobardicus ruber._

        The great Lombard red is a great sad red flower, so double and
        thick of leaues, that it most vsually breaketh the pod, and
        seldome showeth one flower among twenty perfect: the blades or
        greene leaues are as large as the _Hulo_.


_Carophylli majores._

        GILLOFLOWERS.

_Caryophyllus maior Westminsteriensis._

        The lustie Gallant or Westminster (some make them to be one
        flower, and others to bee two, one bigger then the other)
        at the first blowing open of the flower sheweth to be of a
        reasonable size and comelinesse, but after it hath stood blowen
        some time it sheweth smaller and thinner: it is of a bright red
        colour, much striped and speckled with white.

_Caryophyllus maior Bristoliensis purpureus._

        The Bristow blew hath greene leaues, so large, that it would
        seeme to bring a greater flower then it doth, yet the flower
        is of a reasonable size, and very like vnto the ordinary
        _Granado_ Gilloflower, striped and flaked in the same manner,
        but that the white of this is purer then that, and the purple
        is more light, and tending to a blew: this doth not abide
        constant, but changeth into purple or blush.

_Caryophyllus maior Bristoliensis carneus._

        The Bristow blush is very like the last both in leafe and
        flower, the colour only sheweth the difference, which seldome
        varyeth to be spotted, or change colour.

_Caryophyllus maior Doroborniensis ruber._

        The red Douer is a reasonable great Gilloflower and constant,
        being of a faire red thicke poudered with white spots, and
        seemeth somewhat like vnto the ground Carnation.

_Caryophyllus maior Doroborniensis dilutus siue albus._

        The light or white Douer is for forme and all other things more
        comely then the former, the colour of the flower is blush,
        thicke spotted with very small spots, that it seemeth all gray,
        and is very delightfull.

_Caryophyllus maior Cantii._

        The faire maide of Kent, or Ruffling Robin is a very beautiful
        flower, and as large as the white Carnation almost: the flower
        is white, thicke poudered with purple, wherein the white hath
        the mastrie by much, which maketh it the more pleasant.

_Caryophyllus maior Regineus._

        The Queenes Gilloflower is a reasonable faire Gilloflower
        although very common, striped red and white, some great and
        some small with long stripes.

_Caryophyllus maior elegans._

        The Daintie is a comely fine flower, although it be not great,
        and for the smallnesse and thinnesse of the flower being red so
        finely marked, striped and speckled, that for the liuelinesse
        of the colours it is much desired, beeing inferiour to very few
        Gilloflowers.

_Caryophyllus maior Brasiliensis._

        The Brassill Gilloflower is but of a meane size, being of a
        sad purple colour, thicke poudered and speckled with white,
        the purple herein hath the mastrie, which maketh it shew the
        sadder, it is vnconstant, varying much and often to bee all
        purple: the greene leaues lye matting on the ground.

_Caryophyllus maior Granatensis._

        The _Granado_ Gilloflower is purple and white, flaked and
        striped very much: this is also much subiect to change purple.
        There is a greater and a lesser of this kinde, besides the
        greatest that is formerly described.

_Caryophyllus Turcicus._

        The Turkie Gilloflower is but a small flower, but of great
        delight, by reason of the well marking of the flower, being
        most vsually equally striped with red and white.

_Caryophyllus Cambrensis Poole._

        The Poole flower, growing naturally vpon the rockes neare
        Cogshot Castle in the Isle of Wight, is a small flower, but
        very pleasant to the eye, by reason of the comely proportion
        thereof; it is of a bright pale red, thicke speckled, and
        very small with white, that it seemeth to bee but one colour,
        the leaues of the flower are but smally iagged about: it is
        constant.

_Caryophyllus Pegma dilutior._

        The light or pale Pageant is a flower of a middle size, very
        pleasant to behold, and is both constant and comely, and but
        that it is so common, would be of much more respect then it is:
        the flower is of a pale bright purple, thicke poudered, and
        very euenly with white, which hath the mastery, and maketh it
        the more gracefull.

_Caryophyllus Pegma saturatior._

        The sad Pageant is the same with the former in forme and
        bignesse, the difference in colour is, that the purple hath
        the mastery, which maketh it so sad, that it doth resemble the
        Brassill for colour, but is not so bigge by halfe.

_Caryophyllus Heroina dictus elegans Magistri Bradshawij._

        Master Bradshawe his dainty Lady may be well reckoned among
        these sorts of Gilloflowers, and compare for neatenesse with
        most of them: the flower is very neate, though small, with a
        fine small iagge, and of a fine white colour on the vnderside
        of all the leaues, as also all the whole iagge for a pretty
        compasse, and the bottome or middle part of the flower on the
        vpperside also: but each leafe is of a fine bright pale red
        colour on the vpperside, from the edge to the middle, which
        mixture is of wonderfull great delight.

_Caryophyllus albus optimus maior Londinensis & alius._

        The best white Gilloflower groweth vpright, and very double,
        the blades growe vpright also, and crawle not on the ground.

        The London white is greater and whiter then the other ordinary
        white, being wholly of one colour.

_Caryophyllus maior rubens & minor._

        The stamell Gilloflower is well knowne to all, not to differ
        from the ordinary red or cloue Gilloflower, but only in being
        of a brighter or light red colour: there is both a greater and
        a lesser of this kinde.

_Caryophyllus purpureus maior & minor._

        The purple Gilloflower a greater and a lesse: the stalke is so
        slender, and the leaues vpon them so many and thicke, that they
        lye and traile on the ground: the greatest is almost as bigge
        as a Chrystall, but not so double: the lesse hath a smaller
        flower.

_Caryophyllus Persico violaceus._

        The Gredeline Gilloflower is a very neate and handsome flower,
        of the bignesse of the Cloue red Gilloflower, of a fine pale
        reddish purple or peach colour, enclining to a blew or violet,
        which is that colour is vsually called a gredeline colour: it
        hath no affinity with eyther Purple, Granado, or Pageant.

_Caryophyllus purpuro cæruleus._

        The blew Gilloflower is neither very double nor great, yet
        round and handsome, with a deepe iagge at the edge, and is of
        an exeeding deepe purple colour, tending to a tawnie; this
        differeth from all other sorts, in that the leafe is as greene
        as grasse, and the stalkes many times red or purple: by the
        greene leaues it may be knowne in the Winter, as well as in the
        Summer.

_Caryophyllus carneus._

        The blush Gilloflower differeth not from the red or stamell,
        but only in the colour of the flower, which is blush.

_Caryophyllus Silefiacus maximus Wittin._

        Iohn Wittie his great tawny Gilloflower is for forme of
        growing, in leafe and flower altogether like vnto the ordinary
        tawny, the flower onely, because it is the fairest and greatest
        that any other hath noursed vp, maketh the difference, as also
        that it is of a faire deepe scarlet colour.

        There are also diuers other Tawnies, either lighter or sadder,
        either lesse or more double, that they cannot be numbered, and
        all rising (as I said before) from sowing the seede of some of
        them: besides the diuersities of other colours both simple and
        mixed, euery yeare and place yeelding some variety was not seen
        with them before: I shall neede but onely to giue you the names
        of some of them we haue abiding with vs, I meane such as haue
        receiued names, and leaue the rest to euery ones particular
        denomination.

        Of Blushes there are many sorts, as the deepe blush, the pale
        blush, the Infanta blush, a blush enclining to a red, a great
        blush, the fairest and most double of all the other blushes,
        and many others both single and double.

        Of Reds likewise there are some varieties, but not so many as
        of the other colours; for they are most dead or deepe reds, and
        few of a bright red or stamell colour; and they are single like
        Pinkes, either striped or speckled, or more double striped and
        speckled variably, or else.

        There are neither purple nor white that rise from this seede
        that I haue obserued, except one white in one place.

        _Caryophyllus Silesiacus striatus._

        The striped Tawny are either greater or lesser, deeper or
        lighter flowers twenty sorts and aboue, and all striped with
        smaller or larger stripes, or equally diuided, of a deeper or
        lighter colour: and some also for the very shape or forme will
        bee more neate, close, and round; others more loose, vnequall,
        and sparsed.

        _Caryophyllus Silesiacus marmor-amulus._

        The marbled Tawny hath not so many varieties as the striped,
        but is of as great beauty and delight as it, or more: the
        flowers are greater or smaller, deeper or lighter coloured one
        then another, and the veines or markes more conspicuous, or
        more frequent in some then in others: but the most beautifull
        that euer I did see was with Master Ralph Tuggie, which I must
        needes therefore call

        _Heroina Rodolphi florum Imperatoris._

        Master Tuggies Princesse, which is the greatest and fairest of
        all these sorts of variable tawnies, or seed flowers, being as
        large fully as the Prince or Chrystall, or something greater,
        standing comely and round, not loose or shaken, or breaking
        the pod as some other sorts will; the marking of the flower is
        in this manner: It is of a stamell colour, striped and marbled
        with white stripes and veines quite through euery leafe, which
        are as deeply iagged as the Hulo: sometimes it hath more red
        then white, and sometimes more white then red, and sometimes
        so equally marked, that you cannot discerne which hath the
        mastery; yet which of these hath the predominance, still the
        flower is very beautifull, and exceeding delightsome.

        _Caryophyllus Silesiacus assulosus._

        The Flaked Tawny is another diuersity of these variable or mixt
        coloured flowers, being of a pale reddish colour, flaked with
        white, not alwaies downeright, but often thwart the leaues,
        some more or lesse then others; the marking of them is much
        like vnto the Chrystall: these also as well as others will be
        greater or smaller, and of greater or lesse beauty then others.

_Caryophyllus Silesiacus plumatus._

        The Feathered Tawny is more rare to meete with then many of the
        other; for most vsually it is a faire large flower and double,
        equalling the Lumbard red in his perfection: the colour hereof
        is vsually a scarlet, little deeper or paler, most curiously
        feathered and streamed with white through the whole leafe.

_Caryophyllus Silesiacus punctatus._

        The Speckled Tawny is of diuers sorts, some bigger, some
        lesse, some more, and some lesse spotted then others: Vsually
        it is a deepe scarlet, speckled or spotted with white, hauing
        also some stripes among the leaues.

_Caryophyllus roseus rotundus Magistri Tuggie._

        Master Tuggie his Rose Gilloflower is of the kindred of these
        Tawnies, being raised from the seede of some of them, and onely
        possessed by him that is the most industrious preseruer of
        all natures beauties, being a different sort from all other,
        in that it hath round leaues, without any iagge at all on the
        edges, of a fine stamell full colour, without any spot or
        strake therein, very like vnto a small Rose, or rather much
        like vnto the red Rose Campion, both for forme, colour, and
        roundnesse, but larger for size.

        The Place.

        All these are nourished with vs in Gardens, none of their
        naturall places being knowne, except one before recited, and
        the yellow which is _Silesia_; many of them being hardly
        preserued and encreased.


        The Time.

        They flower not vntill the heate of the yeare, which is in
        Iuly (vnlesse it be an extraordinary occasion) and continue
        flowring, vntill the colds of the Autumne checke them, or
        vntill they haue wholly out spent themselues, and are vsually
        encreased by the slips.


        The Names.

        Most of our later Writers doe call them by one generall name,
        _Caryophyllus sativus_, and _flos Caryophylleus_, adding
        thereunto _maximus_, when wee meane Carnations, and _maior_
        when we would expresse Gilloflowers, which name is taken from
        Cloues, in that the sent of the ordinary red Gilloflower
        especially doth resemble them. Diuers other seuerall names
        haue beene formerly giuen them, as _Vetonica_, or _Betonica
        altera_, or _Vetonica altilis_, and _coronaria_. _Herba Tunica,
        Viola Damascena, Ocellus Damascenus_, and _Barbaricus_. Of
        some _Cantabrica Plinij_. Some thinke they were vnknowne to
        the Ancients, and some would haue them to be _Iphium_ of
        Theophrastus, wherof he maketh mention in his sixth and seuenth
        Chapters of his sixth booke, among Garland and Summer flowers;
        others to be his _Dios anthos_, or _Iouis flos_, mentioned in
        the former, and in other places. We call them in English (as I
        said before) the greatest kindes, Carnations, and the others
        Gilloflowers (_quasi_ Iuly flowers) as they are seuerally
        expressed.


        The Vertues.

        The red or Cloue Gilloflower is most vsed in Physicke in our
        Apothecaries shops, none of the other being accepted of or vsed
        (and yet I doubt not, but all of them might serue, and to good
        purpose, although not to giue so gallant a tincture to a Syrupe
        as the ordinary red will doe) and is accounted to be very
        Cordiall.




CHAP. LXX.

_Caryophylli siluestres._   Pinkes.


There remaine diuers sorts of wilde or small Gilloflowers (which wee
vsually call Pinkes) to be entreated of, some bearing single, and some
double flowers, some smooth, almost without any deepe dents on the
edges, and some iagged, or as it were feathered. Some growing vpright
like vnto Gilloflowers, others creeping or spreading vnder the toppe
or crust of the ground, some of one colour, some of another, and many
of diuers colours: As I haue formerly done with the Gilloflowers, so
must I doe with these that are entertained in our Gardens, onely giue
you the descriptions of some three or foure of them, according to their
variety, and the names of the rest, with their distinctions.

]


1. _Caryophyllus minor siluestris multiplex & simplex._
Double and single Pinkes.

The single and double Pinkes are for forme and manner of growing, in
all parts like vnto the Gilloflowers before described, sauing onely
that their leaues are smaller and shorter, in some more or lesse then
in others, and so are the flowers also: the single kindes consisting of
fiue leaues vsually (seldome six) round pointed, and a little snipt for
the most part about the edges, with some threads in the middle, either
crooked or straight: the double kindes being lesser, and lesse double
then the Gilloflowers, hauing their leaues a little snipt or endented
about the edges, and of diuers seuerall colours, as shall hereafter be
set downe, and of as fragrant a sent, especially some of them as they:
the rootes are long and spreading, somewhat hard and wooddy.


2. _Caryophyllus plumarius._   Feathered or iagged Pinkes.

The iagged Pinkes haue such like stalkes and leaues as the former haue,
but somewhat shorter and smaller, or grasse-like, and of a whitish or
grayish greene colour likewise: the flowers stand in the like manner
at the toppes of the stalkes, in long, round, slender, greene huskes,
consisting of fiue leaues, very much cut in on the edges, and iagged
almost like a feather, of a light red, or bright purple colour, with
two white threads standing in the middle, crooked like a horne at the
end, and are of a very good sent. Some of these haue not those two
crooked threads or hornes in the middle, but haue in their stead many
small threads, not crooked at all: the seedes of them all are like
vnto the seedes of Gilloflowers, or the other Pinkes, that is, small,
blacke, long, and flat: the rootes are small and wooddy likewise.


3. _Caryophyllus plumarius albus orbe rubro siue Stellatus._
Starre Pinkes.

Of this kinde there is another sort, bearing flowers almost as deeply
cut or iagged as the former, of a faire white colour, hauing a ring or
circle of red about the bottome or lower part of the leaues, and are
as sweete as the former: this being sowne of seede doth not giue the
starre of so bright a red colour, but becommeth more dunne.


4. _Caryophyllus plumarius Austriacus siue Superba Austriaca._
The feathered Pinke of Austria.

This kinde of Pinke hath his first or lower leaues, somewhat broader
and greener then any of the former Pinkes, being both for breadth and
greennesse more like vnto the Sweete Iohns, which shall bee described
in the next Chapter: the leaues on the stalkes are smaller, standing
by couples at euery ioynt, at the toppes whereof stand such like
iagged flowers as the last described, and as large, but more deeply
cut in or iagged round about, some of them of a purplish colour, but
the most ordinary with vs are pure white, and of a most fragrant sent,
comforting the spirits and senses a farre off: the seedes and rootes
are like vnto the former. Some haue mistaken a kinde of wilde Campion,
growing in our Woods, and by the paths sides in Hornsie Parke, and
other places, to be this feathered Pinke: but the flowers declare the
difference sufficiently.


5. _Caryophyllus minor repens simplex & multiplex._
Single and double matted Pinkes.

The matted Pinke is the smallest, both for leafe and flower of all
other Pinkes that are nourished in Gardens, hauing many short and
small grassie greene leaues vpon the stalkes, which as they grow and
lye vpon the ground (and not standing so vpright as the former) doe
take roote againe, whereby it quickly spreadeth, and couereth a great
deale of ground in a little space: the flowers are small and round, a
little snipt about the edges, whereof some are white, and some red,
and some are white spotted with red, and some red spotted with white,
all of them being single flowers. But there is another of this kinde,
not differing in leafe, but in flower: for that the first flowers are
but once double, or of two rowes of leaues, of a fine reddish colour,
spotted with siluer spots: but those that follow, are so thicke and
double, that they oftentimes doe breake the pod or huske; being not
altogether of so deepe a red colour, but more pale.


6. _Caryophyllus Mediterraneus siue Marinus maior._
Great Sea Gilloflower or Great Thrift.

Vnto these kindes of Pinkes I must needs adde, not only our ordinary
Thrift (which is more frequent in gardens, to empale or border a knot,
because it abideth greene Winter and Summer, and that by cutting, it
may grow thick, and be kept in what form one list, rather then for any
beautie of the flowers) but another greater kinde, which is of as great
beautie and delight almost as any of the former Pinkes, as well for
that the leaues are like vnto Gilloflowers, being longer and larger
then any Pinkes, and of a whitish greene colour like vnto them, not
growing long or by couples vpon the stalkes as Pinkes and Gilloflowers
doe, but tufting close vpon the ground, like vnto the common Thrift: as
also that the stalkes, rising from among the leaues (being sometimes
two foote high (as I haue obserued in my garden) are yet so slender and
weake, that they are scarce able to beare the heads of flowers, naked
or bare, both of leaues and ioynts, failing only in one place, where
at the ioynt each stalke hath two small and very short leaues, not
rising vpwards as in all other Gilloflowers, Pinkes, and other herbes,
but growing downewards) and doe beare each of them a tuft or vmbell
of small purplish, or blush coloured flowers, at the toppes of them
standing somewhat like vnto sweete Williams, but more roundly together,
each flower consisting of fiue small, round, stiffe or hardish leaues,
as if they were made of paper, the bottome or middle being hollow, not
blowing all at once as the ordinary Thrift, but for the most part one
after another, not shewing vsually aboue foure or fiue flowers open
at one time (so farre as I could obserue in the plants that I kept)
so that it was long before the whole tuft of flowers were past; but
yet the hoter and dryer the time was, the sooner it would be gone:
the seede I haue not perfectly obserued, but as I remember, it was
somewhat like vnto the seede of Scabious; I am sure nothing like vnto
Gilloflowers or Pinkes: the roote is somewhat great, long and hard, and
not so much spreading in the ground as Gilloflowers or Pinkes.


7. _Caryophyllus Marinus._   Thrift, or Sea Cushion.

Our common Thrift is well knowne vnto all, to haue many short and
hard greene leaues, smaller then many of the grasses, growing thicke
together, and spreading vpon the ground: the stalkes are naked of
leaues a spanne high, bearing a small tuft of light purple, or blush
coloured flowers, standing round and close thrusting together.


Double Pinkes.

The double white Pinke is onely with more leaues in it then
the single which maketh the difference.

The double red Pinke is in the same manner double, differing
from the single of the same colour.

The double purple Pinke differeth not from the single purple
for colour, but only in the doublenesse of the flower.

The _Granado_ Pinke differeth not from the Gilloflower of
the same name, but in the smalnesse both of leaues and flower.

The double Matted Pinke is before described.

The double blush Pinke is almost as great as the ordinary
blush Gilloflower, and some haue taken it for one, but the
greene leaues are almost as small as Pinks, and therefore I
referre it to them.

          Single Pinkes.

          The single white ordinary Pinke hath a single white flower of
          fiue leaues, finely iagged about the edges.

          The single red pink is like the white, but that the leaues
          are not so much iagged, and the flower is of a pale purplish
          red colour,

          The single purple Pinke is of a faire purple colour, like
          almost vnto the purple Gilloflower.

          The great blush Pinke hath broader and larger leaues in the
          flower then any other Pinke, and of a faire blush colour.

          The white Featherd Pinke hath the edges of the flower more
          finely and deeply cut in then the former.

          The red or light purple featherd Pinke is like the former
          featherd Pinke, but only differeth in colour.

          The Starre Pinke is a faire flower, finely iagged on the
          edges, with a faire red circle at the lower end of the leaues
          on the inside.

          The white featherd Pinke of Austria is described before.
          The purple featherd Pinke of Austria is so likewise. The
          single matted Pinke is before described. The speckled Pinke
          is a small flower hauing small spots of red here and there
          dispersed ouer the white flower.

          Those single flowers being like vnto Pinkes that rise from
          the sowing of the orenge tawney, I bring not into this
          _classis_, hauing already spoken of them in the precedent
          Chapter.


        The Place.

        These are all like as the former, nourished in Gardens with
        vs, although many of them are found wilde in many places of
        Austria, Hungarie, and Germany, on the mountaines, and in many
        other places, as Clusius recordeth. The ordinary Thrift groweth
        in the salt Marshes at Chattam by Rochester, and in many other
        places in England: but the great kinde was gathered in Spaine,
        by Guillaume Boel that painefull searcher of simples, and the
        seede thereof imparted to me, from whence I had diuers plants,
        but one yeare after another they all perished.


        The Time.

        Many of these Pinkes both single and double, doe flower before
        any Gilloflower, and so continue vntill August, and some, most
        of the Summer and Autumne.


        The Names.

        The seuerall titles that are giuen to these Pinkes, may
        suffice for their particular names: and for their generall
        they haue beene expressed in the former Chapter, beeing of the
        same kindred, but that they are smaller, and more frequently
        found wilde. The two sorts of Thrift are called _Caryophyllus
        Marinus_. The greater, _Maior & Mediterraneus_; In English,
        The greater or Leuant Thrift, or Sea Gilloflower. The lesser
        _Minimus_, and is accounted of some to be a grasse, and
        therefore called _Gramen Marinum & Polyanthemum_; In English,
        Thrift, Sea grasse, and our Ladies Cushion, or Sea Cushion.


        The Vertues.

        It is thought by diuers, that their vertues are answerable to
        the Gilloflowers, yet as they are of little vse with vs, so I
        thinke of as small effect.




CHAP. LXXI.

_Armerius._   Sweet Iohns, and sweet Williams.


These kindes of flowers as they come neerest vnto Pinkes and
Gilloflowers, though manifestly differing, so it is fitted to place
them next vnto them in a peculiar Chapter.


1. _Armerius angustifolius rubens simplex._   Single red sweete Iohns.

The sweete Iohn hath his leaues broader, shorter, and greener then any
of the former Gilloflowers, but narrower then sweete Williams, set by
couples, at the ioynts of the stalkes, which are shorter then most of
the former, and not aboue a foote and a halfe high, at the tops whereof
stand many small flowers, like vnto small Pinkes, but standing closer
together, and in shorter huskes, made of fiue leaues, smaller then most
of them, and more deeply iagged then the Williams, of a red colour in
the middle, and white at the edges, but of a small or soft sent, and
not all flowring at once, but by degrees: the seede is blacke, somewhat
like vnto the seede of Pinkes, the roote is dispersed diuersly, with
many small fibres annexed vnto it.


2. _Armerius angustifolius albus simplex._   Single white sweet Iohns.

This white Iohn differeth not in any thing from the former, but onely
that the leafe doth neuer change brownish, and that the flower is of a
faire white colour, without any mixture.


3. _Armerius angustifolius duplex._   Double sweet Iohns.

There is of both those former kindes, some whose flowers are once
double, that is, consisting of two or three rowes of leaues, and the
edges not so deeply iagged; not differing in any thing else.


4. _Armerius latifolius simplex flore rubro._
Single red sweet Williams.

The sweet Williams doe all of them spread into many very long traylng
branches, with leaues lying on the ground, in the very like manner
that the sweete Iohns doe: the chiefe differences betweene them are,
that these haue broader, and darker greene leaues, somewhat brownish,
especially towards the points, and that the flowers stand thicker and
closer, and more in number together, in the head or tuft, hauing many
small pointed leaues among them, but harmlesse, as all men know; the
colour of the flower is of a deep red, without any mixture or spot at
all.


5. _Armerius latifolius flore rubro multiplici._
Double red sweete Williams.

The double kinde differeth not from the single kinde of the same
colour, but only in the doublenesse of the flowers, which are with two
rowes of leaues in euery flower.


6. _Armerius latifolius variegatus siue versicolor._
Speckled sweete Williams, or London pride.

These spotted Williams are very like the first red Williams, in
the forme or maner of growing, hauing leaues as broade, and browne
sometimes as they, the flowers, stand as thicke or thicker, clustring
together, but of very variable colours: for some flowers will be of a
fine delayed red, with few markes or spots vpon them, and others will
bee full speckled or sprinkled with white or siluer spots, circlewise
about the middle of the flowers, and some will haue many specks or
spots vpon them dispersed: all these flowers are not blowne at one
time, but some are flowring, when others are decaying, so that abiding
long in their pride, they become of the more respect: The seede is
blacke, as all the rest, and not to be distinguished one from another:
the roots are some long, and some small and threddy, running vnder the
vpper crust of the earth.


7. _Armerius latifolius flore rubro saturo holofericeo._
Sweet Williams of a deepe red or murrey colour.

The leaues of this kinde seeme to be a little larger, and the ioints
a little redder then the former, but in the flower consisteth the
chiefest difference, which is of a deepe red, or murrey purple colour,
like vnto veluet of that colour, without any spots, but smooth, and as
it were soft in handling, hauing an eye or circle in the middle, at the
bottome of the leaues.


8. _Armerius latifolius simplex flore albo._
Single white sweete Williams.

The white kinde differeth not in forme, but in colour from the former,
the leaues are not browne at all, but of a fresh greene colour, and the
flowers are wholly white, or else they are all one.


        The Place.

        These for the most part grow wilde in Italie, and other places:
        we haue them in our Gardens, where they are cherished for their
        beautifull varietie.


        The Time.

        They all generally doe flower before the Gilloflowers or
        Pinkes, or with the first of them: their seede is ripe in Iune
        and Iuly, and doe all well abide the extremitie of our coldest
        winters.


        The Names.

        They all generally are called _Armerius_, or _Armeria_, as some
        doe write, and distinguished as they are in their titles: Yet
        some haue called them _Vetonica agrestis_, and others _Herba
        Tunica_, _Scarlatea_, & _Caryophyllus siluestris_: Wee doe
        in English in most places, call the first or narrower leafed
        kindes, Sweet Iohns, and all the rest Sweete Williams; yet in
        some places they call the broader leafed kindes that are not
        spotted, Tolmeiners, and London tufts: but the speckled kinde
        is termed by our English Gentlewomen, for the most part, London
        pride.


        The Vertues.

        We haue not knowne any of these vsed in Physicke.

_Bellis._   Daisie.


There be diuers sorts of Daisies, both great and small, both single and
double, both wilde growing abroade in the fieldes, and elsewhere, and
manured growing only in Gardens: of all which I intend not to entreate,
but of those that are of most beautie and respect, and leaue the rest
to their proper place.

        Globeflower.

        yellow Daisies or yellow Globeflower.
]


1. _Bellis maior flore albo pleno._   The great double white Daisie.

The great Daisie with the double white flower, is in all things so
like vnto the great single kinde, that groweth by the high wayes, and
in diuers medowes and fields, that there is no difference but in the
flower, which is double. It hath many long, and somewhat broad leaues
lying vpon the ground, deepely cut in on both sides, somewhat like
vnto an oaken leafe; but those that are on the stalkes are shorter,
narrower, and not so deeply cut in, but onely notched on the edges:
the flowers at the toppe are (as I said) white and double, consisting
of diuers rowes of leaues, being greater in compasse then any of the
double Daisies that follow, but nothing so double of leaues.


2. _Bellis minor flore rubro simplici._   Single red Daisies.

This single Daisie (like as all the rest of the small Daisies) hath
many smooth, greene, round pointed leaues lying on the ground, a
little snipt about the edges; from among which rise many slender round
foote-stalkes, rather then stalkes or stems, about an hand breadth high
at the most, and oftentimes not halfe so high, bearing one flower a
peece, consisting of many small leaues, as a pale or border set about a
middle thrumme: the leaues of this kinde are almost wholly red, whereas
in the wilde they are white or whitish, enclining to red on the edges,
the middle being yellow in both sorts: the rootes are many small white
threads or strings.


3. _Bellis minor hortensis flore pleno variorum colorum._
Double Garden Daisies of diuers colours.

The leaues of all the double Daisies are in forme like vnto the single
ones, but that they are smaller, and little or nothing snipt or notched
about the edges: the small stalkes like wise are smaller and lower,
but bearing as double flowers as any that growe on the ground, being
composed of many small leaues, thicke thrust together, of diuers
colours; for some are wholly of a pure white, others haue a little red,
either dispersed vpon the white leaues, or on the edges, and sometimes
on the backes of the leaues: some againe seeme to be of a whitish red,
or more red then white, when as indeede they are white leaues dispersed
among the red; others of a deepe or darke red colour, and some are
speckled or striped with white and red through the whole flower: and
some the leaues will bee red on the vpperside, and white vnderneath;
and some also (but those are very rare) are of a greenish colour.


4. _Bellis minor hortensis prolifera._
Double double Daisies or childing Daisies.

There is no difference either in leafe or roote in this kinde from the
former double Daisies: the chiefest variety consisteth in this, that
it beareth many small double flowers, standing vpon very short stalkes
round about the middle flower, which is vsually as great and double as
any of the other double kindes, and is either wholly of a deepe red
colour, or speckled white and red as in some of the former kindes, or
else greenish, all the small flowers about it being of the same colour
with the middlemost.


5. _Bellis cærulea siue Globularia._   Blew Daisies.

The likenesse and affinity that this plant hath with the former, both
in the forme of leafe and flower, as also in the name, hath caused me
to insert it, and another rare plant of the same kinde, in this place,
although they be very rare to be met with in our English Gardens. This
beareth many narrower, shorter, and blacker greene leaues then the
former, lying round about vpon the ground; among which rise vp slender,
but stiffe and hard stalks, halfe a foot high or more, set here and
there with small leaues, and at the top a small round head, composed of
many small blew leaues, somewhat like vnto the head of a Scabious: It
hath bin found likewise with a white head of flowers: the roote is hard
and stringie: the whole plant is of a bitter taste.


6. _Globularia lutea montana._   Yellow Daisies.

This mountaine yellow Daisie or Globe-flower hath many thicke, smooth,
round pointed leaues, spread vpon the ground like the former; among
which spring diuers small round rushie stalkes, a foote high, bearing
about the middle of them two small leaues at the ioynts, and at the
toppes round heads of flowers thrust thicke together, standing in
purplish huskes, euery of which flowers do blow or spread into fiue
leaues, starre-fashion, and of a faire yellow colour, smelling like
vnto broome flowers, with many small threads in the middle compassing a
flat pointell, horned or bended two wayes: after the flowers are past
rise vp the seede vessels, which are round, swelling out in the middle,
and diuided into foure parts at the toppes, containing within them
round, flat, blacke seede, with a small cut or notch in them: the roote
is a finger long, round and hard, with a thicke barke, and a woddy pith
in the middle, of a sharpe drying taste and strong sent: the leaues are
also sharpe, but bitter.


        The Place.

        The small Daisies are all planted, and found onely in Gardens,
        and will require to be replanted often, lest they degenerate
        into single flowers, & at least into lesse double. The
        blew Daisie is naturall of Mompelier in France, and on the
        mountaines in many places of Italy, as also the yellow kinde in
        the Kingdome of Naples.


        The Time.

        The Daisies flower betimes in the Spring, and last vntill May,
        but the last two flower not vntill August or September.


        The Names.

        They are vsually called in Latine _Bellides_, and in English
        Daisies. Some call them _Herba Margarita_, and _Primula veris_,
        as it is likely after the Italian names, of _Marguerite_,
        and _Flor di prima vera gentile_. The French call them
        _Pasquettes_, and _Marguerites_, and the Fruitfull sort,
        or those that beare small flowers about the middle one,
        _Margueritons_: our English women call them Iacke an Apes on
        horse-backe, as they doe Marigolds before recited, or childing
        Daisies: but the Physitians and Apothecaries doe in generall
        call them, especially the single or Field kindes, _Consolida
        minor_. The blew Daisie is called _Bellis cærulea_, and
        _Globularia_, of some _Scabiosæ pumilum genus_. The Italians
        call it _Botanaria_, because the heads are found like buttons.
        The yellow, _Globularia montana_, is onely described by Fabius
        Columna, in his last part of _Phytobasanos_, and by him
        referred vnto the former _Globularia_, although it differ in
        some notable points from it.


        The Vertues.

        The properties of Daisies are certainly to binde, and the roote
        especially being dryed, they are vsed in medicines to that
        purpose. They are also of speciall account among those herbes,
        that are vsed for wounds in the head.




CHAP. LXXIII.

_Scabiosa._   Scabious.


The sorts of Scabious being many, yeeld not flowers of beauty or
respect, fit to bee cherished in this our Garden of delight; and
therefore I leaue them to the Fields and Woods, there to abide. I haue
onely two or three strangers to bring to your acquaintance, which are
worthy this place.


1. _Scabiosa flore albo._   White flowred Scabious.

This white Scabious hath many long leaues, very much iagged or gasht in
on both sides, of a meane bignesse, being neither so large as many of
the field, nor so small as any of the small kindes: the stalkes rise
about a foote and a halfe high, or somewhat higher, at the tops whereof
grow round heads, thicke set with flowers, like in all points vnto the
field Scabious, but of a milke white colour.


2. _Scabiosa rubra Austriaca._   Red Scabious of Austria.

This red Scabious hath many leaues lying vpon the ground, very like
vnto Deuils bit, but not so large, being shorter and snipt, not gashed
about the edges, of a light greene colour; yet (there is another of
a darker greene colour, whose flower is of a deeper red) the stalkes
haue diuers such leaues on them, set by couples at the ioynts as grow
belowe, and at the tops small heads of flowers, each consisting of
fiue leaues, the biggest flowers standing round about in the outer
compasse, as is vsuall almost in all the kinds of Scabious, of a fine
light purple or red colour: after the flowers are past, come the seede,
which is somewhat long and round, set with certaine haires at the head
thereof, like vnto a Starre: the roote is composed of a number of
slender strings, fastened at the head.


3. _Scabiosa rubra Indica._   Red flowred Indian Scabious.

This (reputed Indian) Scabious hath many large faire greene leaues
lying on the ground, iagged or cut in on both sides to the middle
ribbe, euery peece whereof is narrower then that at the end, which
is the broadest: among these leaues rise vp sundry slender and weake
stalkes, yet standing vpright for the most part, set with smaller and
more iagged leaues at certaine distances, two or three at euery ioynt,
branching forth at the toppe into other smaller branches, bearing euery
one head of flowers, like in forme vnto other Scabiouses, but of an
excellent deepe red crimson colour (and sometimes more pale or delayed)
of no sent at all; after which doe come small roundish seede, like vnto
the field Scabious: the roote is long and round, compassed with a great
many small strings, and perisheth vsually as soone as it hath borne
out his flowers and seede: otherwise if it doe not flower the first
yeare of the sowing, if it be carefully defended from the extremity of
Winter, it will flower the sooner the next yeare, as I my selfe haue
often found by experience.


        The Place.

        The first is sometimes found wilde in our owne Countrey, but it
        is very geason, and hath been sent among other rare seedes from
        Italy.

        The second was first found and written of by Clusius, in
        Pannonia and Austria, where it is very plentifull.

        The third hath been sent both from Spaine & Italy, and is
        verily thought to grow naturally in both those parts.

]


        The Time.

        The first and second flower earlier then the last, for that it
        flowreth not vntill September or October, (vnlesse it be not
        apt to beare the first yeare as I before said) so that many
        times (if none be more forward) it perisheth without bearing
        ripe seede, whereby we are oftentimes to seeke new seede from
        our friends in other parts.


        The Names.

        They haue all one generall name of Scabious, distinguished
        eyther by their flower, or place of growing, as in their
        titles: yet the last is called of diuers _Scabiosa exotica_,
        because they thinke the name _Indica_, is not truely imposed
        vpon it.


        The Vertues.

        Whether these kindes haue any of the vertues of the other wilde
        kinds, I know none haue made any experience, and therefore I
        can say no more of them.




CHAP. LXXIIII.

_Cyanus._   Corne flower, or blew Bottles.


Vnder the name of _Cyanus_ are comprehended, not onely those plants
which from the excellent blew colour of their flowers (furnishing or
rather pestering the Corne fieldes) haue peculiarly obtained that name,
and which doth much vary also, in the colour of the flowers, as shall
be shewed; but some other plants also for their neere resemblance, but
with seuerall distinctions. The _Cyanus maior_, _Ptarmica Austriaca_,
_Ptarmica Imperati_, and many others which may be adioyned vnto them,
do more fitly belong to the Garden of Simples, whereunto I leaue them,
and will here only entreate of those that may most please the delight
of our Gentle Florists, in that I labour and striue, to furnish this
our garden, with the chiefest choyse of natures beauties and delights.


1. _Cyanus vulgaris diuersorum colorum._
Corne flower of diuers colours.

All these sorts of Corne flowers are for the most part alike, both
in leaues and flowers one vnto another for the forme: the difference
betweene them consisteth in the varying colour of the flowers: For the
leaues are long, and of a whitish greene colour, deeply cut in on the
edges in some places, somewhat like vnto the leaues of a Scabious: the
stalkes are two foote high or better, beset with such like leaues but
smaller, and little or nothing cut in on the edges: the toppes are
branched, bearing many small greene scaly heads, out of which rise
flowers, consisting of fiue or sixe, or more long and hollow leaues,
small at the bottome, and opening wider and greater at the brims,
notched or cut in on the edges, and standing round about many small
threds in the middle: the colours of these flowers are diuers, and very
variable; for some are wholly blew, or white, or blush, or of a sad,
or light purple, or of a light or dead red, or of an ouerworne purple
colour, or else mixed of these colours, as some, the edges white, and
the rest blew or purple, or the edges blew or purple, and the rest of
the flower white, or striped, spotted, or halfed, the one part of one
colour, and the other of another, the threds likewise in the middle
varying in many of them; for some will haue the middle thrume of a
deeper purple then the outer leaues, and some haue white or blush
leaues, the middle thrume being reddish, deeper or paler. After the
flowers are past, there come small, hard, white and shining seede in
those heads, wrapped or set among a deale of flockie matter, as is
most vsuall, in all plants that beare scaly heads: the rootes are long
and hard, perishing euery yeare when it hath giuen seede.


2. _Cyanus floridus Turcicus._   The Sultans flower.

As a kinde of these Corne flowers, I must needes adioyne another
stranger, of much beautie, and but lately obtained from Constantinople,
where, because (as it is said) the great Turke, as we call him, saw it
abroade, liked it, and wore it himselfe; all his vassals haue had it
in great regard, and hath been obtained from them, by some that haue
sent it into these parts. The leaues whereof are greener, and not only
gashed, but finely snipt on the edges: the stalkes are three foote
high, garnished with the like leaues as are below, and branched as the
former, bearing large scaly heads, and such like flowers but larger,
hauing eight or nine of those hollow gaping leaues in euery flower,
standing about the middle threds (if it be planted in good and fertile
ground and be well watered, for it soone starueth and perisheth with
drought) the circling leaues are of a fine delayed purple or blush
colour, very beautifull to behold; the seede of this is smaller and
blacker, and not enclosed in so much dounie substance, as the former
(yet in our Countrey the seede is not so blacke, as it came vnto vs,
but more gray) the roote perisheth likewise euery yeere.


3. _Cyanus Bæticus supinus._   The Spanish Corne-flower.

This Spanish kinde hath many square low bending or creeping stalkes,
not standing so vpright as the former, but branching out more diuersly;
so that one plant will take vp a great deale of ground: the leaues
are broader then any of the rest, softer also, of a pale or whitish
greene colour, and not much gashed on the edges: the flowers stand in
bigger heads, with foure or fiue leaues vnder euery head, and are of a
light pale purple or blush colour; after which come seede, but not so
plentifully, yet wrapped in a great deale of flockie matter, more then
any: the roote groweth downe deepe into the ground, but perisheth euery
yeare as they doe.


        The Place.

        The first or former kindes, grow many times in the Corne fields
        of our own Countrey, as well as of others, especially that sort
        with a blew flower: but the other sorts or colours are not so
        frequent, but are nourished in gardens, where they will vary
        wonderfully.

        The second as is before set downe, groweth in Turkie: and
        the last in Spaine, found out and first sent to vs by that
        industrious searcher of simples, Guillaume Boel before
        remembred.


        The Time.

        The first doe flower in the end of Iune, and in Iuly, and
        sometimes sooner. The other two later, and not vntill August
        most commonly, and the seede is soone ripe after.


        The Names.

        The first is generally called _Cyanus_, and some following
        the Ditch name, call it _Flos frumenti_. The olde Writers
        gaue it the name of _Bapti sæcuba_, which is almost worne
        out. We doe call them in English, Blew Bottles, and in some
        places, Corne flowers, after the Ditch names. The second hath
        beene sent by the name of _Ambreboi_, which whether it be a
        Turkie or Arabian name, I know not. I haue called it from the
        place, from whence we had it, _Turcicus_, and for his beauty,
        _Floridus_. The Turkes themselues as I vnderstand, doe call it
        The Sultans flower, and I haue done so likewise, that it may
        bee distinguished from all the other kindes, or else you may
        call it, The Turkey blush Corne flower, which you please. The
        last was sent by the name of _Iacea Bætica_, but I had rather
        to referre it to the _Cyanus_, or Corne flowers, because the
        flowers are like vnto the Corne flowers, and not vnto the
        Iaceas or Knapweedes.


        The Vertues.

        These had no vse in Physicke in Galen and Dioscorides time, in
        that (as it is thought) they haue made no mention of them: We
        in these dayes doe chiefly vse the first kindes (as also the
        greater sort) as a cooling Cordiall, and commended by some to
        be a remedy, not onely against the plague and pestilentiall
        diseases, but against the poison of Scorpions and Spiders.




CHAP. LXXV.

_Iacea Marina Bætica._   Spanish Sea Knapweede.


There are a great many sorts of Knapweedes, yet none of them all fit
for this our Garden, but this only stranger, which I haue beene bold
to thrust in here, for that it hath such like gaping or open flowers,
as the former Corne flowers haue, but notably differing, and therefore
deserueth a peculiar Chapter, as partaking both with _Cyanus_ and
_Iacea_. It hath many long and narrow leaues vneuenly dented or waued
on both edges (and not notched, gashed or indented, as many other
herbes are) being thicke, fleshie and brittle, a little hairy, and of
an ouerworne darke greene colour, among which rise lowe weake stalkes,
with such like leaues as grow at the bottome, but smaller, bearing
but here and there a flower, of a bright reddish purple colour, like
in forme vnto the Corne flowers, but much larger, with many threds or
thrumes in the middle of the same colour, standing vp higher then any
of the former: this flower riseth out of a large scaly head, all set
ouer with small sharpe (but harmelesse) white prickles: the seedes are
blackish, like vnto the Knapweedes, and larger then any of the former
Corne flowers: the roote is great and thicke, growing deepe into the
ground, fleshie and full of a slimie or clammy iuice, and easie to bee
broken, blackish on the outside, and whitish within, enduring many
yeares, like as the other Knapweedes, or Matfelons doe, growing in time
to be very thicke and great.


        The Place.

        It groweth naturally by the Sea side in Spaine, from whence I
        receiued the seedes of Guillaume Boel, and did abide well in my
        garden a long time, but is now perished.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in the beginning of Iuly, or thereabouts, and
        continueth not long in flower: but the head abideth a great
        while, and is of some beauty after the flower is past; yet
        seldome giueth good seed with vs.


        The Names.

        It hath no other name then is set down in the title, being
        altogether a Nouelist, and not now to be seene with any sauing
        my selfe.


        The Vertues.

        We haue not yet known any use hereof in Physick.

_Cnicus siue Carthamus sativus._   Bastard or Spanish Saffron.


There are two or three sorts of _Cnicus_ or bastard Saffrons which
I passe ouer, as not fit for this Garden, and onely set downe this
kinde, whose flowers are of a fairer and more liuely colour in our
Country, then any hath come ouer from Spaine, where they manure it
for the profit they make thereof, seruing for the dying of Silke
especially, and transporting great quantities to diuers Countries. It
hath large broad leaues, without any prickes at all vpon them in our
Country, growing vpon the stalke, which is strong, hard, and round,
with shorter leaues thereon vp to the toppe, where they are a little
sharpe pointed, and prickly about the edges sometimes, which stalke
riseth three or foure foote high, and brancheth it selfe toward the
toppe, bearing at the end of euery branch one great open scaly head,
out of which thrusteth out many gold yellow threads, of a most orient
shining colour, which being gathered in a dry time, and kept dry, will
abide in the same delicate colour that it bare when it was fresh, for
a very long time after: when the flowers are past, the seede when it
is come to maturity, which is very seldome with vs, is white and hard,
somewhat long, round, and a little cornered: the roote is long, great,
and wooddy, and perisheth quickly with the first frosts.


        The Place.

        It groweth in Spaine, and other hot Countries, but not wilde,
        for that it is accounted of the old Writers, Theophrastus and
        Dioscorides, to be a manured plant.


        The Time.

        It flowreth with vs not vntill August, or September sometimes,
        so that it hardly giueth ripe seede (as I said) neither is
        it of that force to purge, which groweth in these colder
        Countries, as that which commeth from Spaine, and other places.


        The Names.

        The name _Cnicus_ is deriued from the Greekes, and _Carthamus_
        from the Arabians, yet still _sativus_ is added vnto it, to
        shew it is no wilde, but a manured plant, and sowne euery where
        that wee know. Of some it is called _Crocus hortensis_, and
        _Sarasenicus_,from the Italians which so call it. We call it in
        English Bastard Saffron, Spanish Saffron, and Catalonia Saffron.


        The Vertues.

        The flowers are vsed in colouring meates, where it groweth
        beyond Sea, and also for the dying of Silkes: the kernels of
        the seede are onely vsed in Physicke with vs, and serueth well
        to purge flegmaticke humours.




CHAP. LXXVII.

_Carduus._   Thistles.


You may somewhat maruaile, to see mee curious to plant Thistles in
my Garden, when as you might well say, they are rather plagues then
pleasures, and more trouble to weede them out, then to cherish them
vp, if I made therein no distinction or choise; but when you haue
viewed them well which I bring in, I will then abide your censure, if
they be not worthy of some place, although it be but a corner of the
Garden, where something must needes be to fill vp roome. Some of them
are smooth, and without prickes at all, some at the heads onely, and
some all ouer; but yet not without some especiall note or marke worthy
of respect: Out of this discourse I leaue the Artichoke, with all his
kindes, and reserue them for our Kitchin Garden, because (as all know)
they are for the pleasure of the taste, and not of the smell or sight.


1. _Acanthus sativus._   Garden Beares breech.

The leaues of this kinde of smooth thistle (as it is accounted) are
almost as large as the leaues of the Artichoke, but not so sharp
pointed, very deeply cut in and gashed on both edges, of a sad green &
shining colour on the vpperside, and of a yellowish green vnderneath,
with a great thicke rib in the middle, which spread themselues about
the root, taking vp a great deale of ground. After this plant hath
stood long in one place, and well defended from the iniury of the
cold, it sendeth forth from among the leaues one or more great and
strong stalkes, three or foure foote high, without any branch at all,
bearing from the middle to the top many flowers one aboue another,
spike-fashion round about the stalke, with smaller but not diuided
greene leaues at euery flower, which is white, and fashioned somewhat
like vnto a gaping mouth; after which come broad, flat, thicke, round,
brownish yellow seede (as I haue well obserued by them haue beene sent
me out of Spaine, and which haue sprung vp, and doe grow with me; for
in our Countrey I could neuer obserue any seede to haue growne ripe)
the rootes are composed of many great and thicke long strings, which
spread farre in and vnder the ground, somewhat darkish on the outside,
and whitish within, full of a clammy moisture (whereby it sheweth to
haue much life) and doe endure our Winters, if they be not too much
exposed to the sharpe violence thereof, which then it will not endure,
as I haue often found by experience.


2. _Acanthus siluestris._   Wilde or prickly Beares breech.

This prickly Thistle hath diuers long greenish leaues lying on the
ground, much narrower then the former, but cut in on both sides, thicke
set with many white prickes and thornes on the edges: the stalke riseth
not vp so high, bearing diuers such like thornie leaues on them, with
such a like head of flowers on it as the former hath: but the seede
hereof (as it hath come to vs from Italy and other places, for I neuer
saw it beare seed here in this Country) is blacke and round, of the
bignesse of a small pease: the roote abideth reasonable well, if it be
defended somewhat from the extremity of our Winters, or else it will
perish.


3. _Eryngium Pannonicum siue Montanum._   Hungary Sea Holly.

The lower leaues of this Thistle that lye on the ground, are somewhat
large, round, and broad, hard in handling, and a little snipt about
the edges, euery one standing vpon a long foote-stalke: but those that
growe vpon the stalke, which is stiffe, two or three foote high, haue
no foote-stalke, but encompasse it, two being set at euery ioynt, the
toppe whereof is diuided into diuers branches, bearing small round
rough heads, with smaller and more prickly leaues vnder them, and more
cut in on the sides then those belowe: out of these heads rise many
blew flowers, the foote-stalkes of the flowers, together with the
toppes of the branches, are likewise blew and transparent, or shining.

[Sidenote: _Flore albo._]

We haue another of this kinde, the whole toppes of the stalkes with the
heads and branches, are more white then blew: the seede contained in
these heads are white, flat, and as it were chaffie: the roote is great
and whitish, spreading farre into many branches, and somewhat sweete in
taste, like the ordinary Sea Holly rootes.

]


4. _Carduus mollis._   The gentle Thistle.

The leaues of this soft and gentle Thistle that are next vnto the
ground, are greene on the vpperside, and hoary vnderneath, broad
at the bottome, somewhat long pointed, and vneuenly notched about
the edges, with some soft hairie prickles, not hurting the handler,
euery one standing vpon a short foote-stalke; those that growe about
the middle stalke are like the former, but smaller and narrower, and
those next the toppe smallest, where it diuideth it selfe into small
branches, bearing long and scaly heads, out of which breake many
reddish purple threads: the seede is whitish and hard, almost as great
as the seede of the greater Centory: the roote is blackish, spreading
vnder the ground, with many small fibres fastened vnto it, and abideth
a great while.


5. _Carlina humilis._   The lowe Carline Thistle.

This lowe Thistle hath many iagged leaues, of a whitish greene Colour,
armed with small sharp white prickles round about the edges, lying
round about the root vpon the ground, in the middle whereof riseth vp
a large head, without any stalke vnder it, compassed about with many
small and long prickly leaues, from among which the flower sheweth
it selfe, composed of many thin, long, whitish, hard shining leaues,
standing about the middle, which is flat and yellow, made of many
thrums or threads like small flowers, wherein lye small long seede, of
a whitish or siluer colour: the roote is somewhat aromaticall, blackish
on the outside, small and long, growing downewards into the ground.
There is another of this kinde that beareth a higher stalke, and a
redder flower, but there is a manifest difference betweene them.


6. _Carduus Sphærocephalus siue Globosus maior._
The greater Globe Thistle.

The greatest of these beautifull Thistles, hath at the first many large
and long leaues lying on the ground, very much cut in and diuided in
many places, euen to the middle ribbe, set with small sharpe (but not
very strong) thornes or prickles at euery corner of the edges, greene
on the vpperside, and whitish vnderneath: from the middle of these
leaues riseth vp a round stiffe stalke, three foote and a halfe high,
or more, set without order with such like leaues, bearing at the toppe
of euery branch a round hard great head, consisting of a number of
sharpe bearded huskes, compact or set close together, of a blewish
greene colour, out of euery one of which huskes start small whitish
blew flowers, with white threads in the middle of them, and rising
aboue them, so that the heads when they are in full flower, make a
fine shew, much delighting the spectators: after the flowers are past,
the seede encreaseth in euery one, or the most part of the bearded
huskes, which doe still hold their round forme, yntill that being ripe
it openeth it selfe, and the huskes easily fall away one from another,
containing within them a long whitish kernell: the roote is great and
long, blackish on the outside, and dyeth euery yeare when it hath borne
seede.


7. _Carduus Globosus minor._   The lesser Globe Thistle.

The lesser kinde hath long narrow leaues, whiter then the former, but
cut in and gashed on the edges very much with some small prickes on
them; the stalke is not halfe so long, nor the heads halfe so great,
but as round, and with as blew flowers as the greater: this seldome
giueth ripe seede, but recompenseth that fault, in that the roote
perisheth not as the former, but abideth many yeares.


8. _Carduus Eriocephalus siue Tomentosus._   The Friers Crowne.

This woolly Thistle hath many large and long leaues lying on the
ground, cut in on both sides into many diuisions, which are likewise
somewhat vnequally cut in or diuided againe, hauing sharpe white
prickles at euery corner of the diuisions, of a dead or sad greene
colour on the vpperside, and somewhat woolly withall, and grayish
vnderneath: the stalke is strong and tall, foure or fiue foote high
at the least, branching out into diuers parts, euery where beset with
such like leaues as growe below; at the toppe of euery branch there
breaketh out a great whitish round prickly head, flattish at the toppe,
so thicke set with wooll, that the prickles seeme but small spots
or haires, and doth so well resemble the bald crowne of a Frier,
not onely before it be in flower, but especially after it hath done
flowring, that thereupon it deseruedly receiued the name of the Friers
Crowne Thistle: out of these heads riseth forth a purple thrumme, such
as is to be seene in many other wilde Thistles, which when they are
ripe, are full of a flockie or woolly substance, which breake at the
toppe shedding it, and the seede which is blackish, flat, and smooth:
the roote is great and thicke, enduring for some yeares, yet sometimes
perishing, if it be too much exposed to the violence of the frosts in
Winter.


        The Place.

        The first groweth naturally in Spaine, Italy, and France, and
        in many other hot Countries, and growe onely in Gardens in
        these colder climates, and there cherished for the beautifull
        aspect both of the greene plants, and of the stalkes when they
        are in flower. The Carline Thistle is found both in Germany and
        Italy in many places, and as it is reported, in some places of
        the West parts in England. The others are found some in France,
        some in Hungary, and on the Alpes, and the last in Spaine.


        The Time.

        They doe all flower in the Summer moneths, some a little
        earlier or later then others.


        The Names.

        The first is called _Acanthus sativus_ (because the other that
        is prickly, is called _siluestris_ or _spinosus_) and _Branea
        vrsina_; In English, Branck vrsine, and Beares breech. The
        third is called _Eryngium montanum_, _Alpinum_, and _Pannonicum
        latifolium_: In English, Mountaine or Hungary Sea Holly.
        The fourth is called _Carduus mollis_, The gentle Thistle,
        because it hath no harmfull prickles, although it seeme at
        the first shew to be a Thistle. The fifth is called of diuers
        _Chamæleo albus_, and _Carlina_, as if they were both but one
        plant; but Fabius Columna hath in my iudgement very learnedly
        descided that controuersie, making _Carlina_ to be _Ixine_
        of Theophrastus, and _Chamæleo_ another differing Thistle,
        which Gaza translateth _Vernilago_. We call it in English, The
        Carline Thistle. The other haue their names in their titles, as
        much as is conuenient for this discourse.


        The Vertues.

        The first hath alwaies been vsed Physically, as a mollifying
        herbe among others of the like slimie matter in Glisters, to
        open the body; yet Lobel seemeth to make no difference in the
        vse of them both (that is, the prickly as well as the smooth.)
        The Carline Thistle is thought to bee good against poysons and
        infection. The rest are not vsed by any that I know.




CHAP. LXXVIII.

_Fraxinella._   Bastard Dittany.


Hauing finished those pleasing Thistles, I come to other plants of more
gentle handling, and first bring to your consideration this bastard
Dittany, whereof there are found out two especiall kindes, the one with
a reddish, the other with a whitish flower, and each of these hath his
diuersity, as shall be presently declared.


1. _Fraxinella flore rubente._   Bastard Dittany with a reddish flower.

This goodly plant riseth vp with diuers round, hard brownish stalkes,
neare two foote high, the lower parts whereof are furnished with many
winged leaues, somewhat like vnto Liquerice, or a small young Ashe
tree, consisting of seuen, nine, or eleuen leaues set together, which
are somewhat large and long, hard and rough in handling, of a darkish
greene colour, and of an vnpleasant strong resinous sent: the vpper
parts of the stalkes are furnished with many flowers, growing spike
fashion, at certaine distances one aboue another, consisting of fiue
long leaues a peece, whereof foure that stand on the two sides, are
somewhat bending vpwards, and the fift hanging downe, but turning vp
the end of the leafe a little againe, of a faint or pale red colour,
striped through euery leafe with a deeper red colour, and hauing in the
middle a tassell of fiue or six long purplish threds, that bowe downe
with the lower leafe, and turne vp also the ends againe, with a little
freese or thrume at the ends of euery one: after the flowers are past,
arise hard, stiffe, rough, clammy huskes, horned or pointed at the end,
foure or fiue standing together, somewhat like the seede vessels of the
Wolfes-banes, or Colombines, but greater, thicker and harder, wherein
is contained round shining blacke seede, greater then any Colombine
seede by much, and smaller then Peony seede: the roote is white, large,
and spreading many wayes vnder ground, if it stand long: the whole
plant, as well roots as leaues and flowers, are of a strong sent, not
so pleasing for the smell, as the flowers are beautifull to the sight.


2. _Fraxinella flore rubro._   Bastard Dittaine with a red flower.

This differeth not from the former eyther in roote, leafe or flower
for the forme but that the stalkes and leaues are of a darker greene
colour, and that the flowers are of a deeper red colour, (and growing
in a little longer spike), wherein the difference chiefly consisteth,
which is sufficient to distinguish them.


3. _Fraxinella flore albo._   Bastard Dittanie with a white flower.

The white flowred _Fraxinella_ hath his leaues and stalkes of a fresher
greene colour then any of the former; and the flowers are of a pure
white colour, in forme differing nothing at all from the other.


4. _Fraxinella flore albo cæruleo._
Bastard Dittanie with an ash coloured flower.

The colour of the flower of this _Fraxinella_ onely putteth the
difference betweene this, and the last recited with a white flower: for
this beareth a very pale, or whitish blew flower, tending to an ash
colour.


        The Place.

        All these kindes are found growing naturally, in many places
        both of Germany, and Italie: and that with the white flower,
        about Franckford, which being sent me, perished by the way by
        long and euill carriage.


        The Time.

        They flower in Iune and Iuly, and the seede is ripe in August.


        The Names.

        The name _Fraxinella_ is most generally imposed on those
        plants, because of the resemblance of them vnto young Ashes, in
        their winged leaues. Yet some doe call them _Dictamus albus_,
        or _Dictamnus albus_, and _Diptamus albus_, as a difference
        from the _Dictamnus Creticus_, which is a farre differing
        plant. Some would haue it to be _Tragium_ of Dioscorides, but
        beside other things wheaten this differeth from _Tragium_, this
        yeeldeth no milkie iuice, as Dioscorides saith _Tragium_ doth:
        We in English doe eyther call it _Fraxinella_, or after the
        other corrupted name of _Dictamus_, Bastard Dittanie.


        The Vertues.

        It is held to be profitable against the stingings of Serpents,
        against contagious and pestilent diseases, to bring downe the
        feminine courses, for the paines of the belly and the stone,
        and in Epilepticall diseases, and other cold paines of the
        braines: the roote is the most effectual for all these, yet the
        seede is sometimes vsed.




CHAP. LXXIX.

_Legumina._   Pulse.


If I should describe vnto you all the kindes of Pulse, I should vnfold
a little world of varieties therein, more knowne and found out in these
dayes, then at any time before, but that must bee a part of a greater
worke, which will abide a longer time before it see the light. I shall
only select those that are fit for this garden, and set them downe
for your consideration. All sorts of Pulse may be reduced vnder two
generall heads, that is, of Beanes and Pease, of each whereof there
is both tame and wilde: Of Beanes, besides the tame or vsuall garden
Beane, and the French or Kidney Beane, (whereof I meane to entreate
in my Kitchen garden, as pertinent thereto) there is the Lupine or
flat Beane, whereof I meane to entreate here, and the blacke Beane and
others which must bee reserued for the Physicke Garden. And of the
kindes of Pease some are fit for this Garden; (whereunto I will adioyne
two or three other plants as neerest of affinitie, the flowers of
some, and the fruit of others being delightfull to many, and therefore
fit for this garden) some for the Kitchen, the rest for the Physicke
garden. And first of Lupines or flat Beanes, accepted as delightfull to
many, and therefore fit for this garden.


1. _Lupinus sativus albus._   The white garden Lupine.

The garden Lupine riseth vp with a great round stalke, hollow and
somewhat woolly, with diuers branches, whereon grow vpon long
footestalkes many broade leaues, diuided into seuen or nine parts,
or smaller leaues, equally standing round about, as it were in a
circle, of a whitish greene colour on the vpperside, and more woolly
vnderneath: the flowers stand many together at seuerall ioynts, both of
the greater stalke, and the branches, like vnto beanes, and of a white
colour in some places, and in others of a very bleake blew tending to
white: after the flowers are past, there come in their places, long,
broade, and flat rough cods, wherein are contained round and flat
seede, yellowish on the inside, and couered with a tough white skin,
and very bitter in taste: the rootes are not very great, but full of
small fibres, whereby it fasteneth it selfe strongly in the ground, yet
perisheth euery yeare, as all the rest of these kindes doe.


2. _Lupinus cæruleus maximus._   The greater blew Lupine.

The Stemme or stalke of this Lupine is greater then the last before
recited, as also the leaues more soft and woolly, and the flowers are
of a most perfect blew colour, with some white spots in the middle:
the long rough greenish cods are very great and large, wherein are
contained hard, flat and round seede, not so white on the outside as
the former, but somewhat yellower, greater also, and more rough or hard
in handling.


3. _Lupinus cæruleus minor._   The lesser blew Lupine.

This kinde of wilde Lupine differeth not in the forme of leafe or
flower from the former, but only that it is much smaller, the leaues
are greener, and haue fewer diuisions in them: the flower is of as
deepe a blew colour as the last; the cods likewise are small and long,
containing small round seede, not so flat as the former, but more
discoloured or spotted on the outside, then the greater kinde is.

[Sidenote: _Minimus._]

There is a lesser kind then this, not differing in any thing from this,
but that it is lesser.


4. _Lupinus flore luteo._   The yellow Lupine.

The yellow Lupine groweth not vsually so high, but with larger leaues
then the small blew Lupine; the flowers grow in two or three rundles
or tufts, round about the stalke and the branches at the ioynts, of a
delicate fine yellow colour, like in fashion vnto the other kindes,
being larger then the last, but nothing so large as the greater kindes,
and of a fine small sent: the seede is round, and not very flat, but
much about the forme and bignesse of the small blew, or somewhat
bigger, of a whitish colour on the outside, spotted with many spots.


        The Place.

        The first groweth in many places of Greece, and the Easterne
        Countries beyond it, where it hath beene anciently cherished
        for their foode, being often watered to take away the
        bitternesse. It groweth also in these Western parts, but still
        where it is planted. The great blew Lupine is thought to come
        from beyond the parts of Persia, in Caramania. The lesser blew
        is found very plentifully wilde, in many places both of Spaine
        and Italy. The last hath beene brought vs likewise out of
        Spaine, whereas it is thought it groweth naturally. They all
        grow now in the gardens of those, that are curious louers of
        these delights.


        The Time.

        They flower in Summer, and their seede is ripe quickly after.


        The Names.

        They are generally called _Lupini_. Plautus in his time saith,
        they were vsed in Comedies in stead of money, when in any Scene
        thereof there was any shew of payment, and therefore he calleth
        them _Aurum Comicum_. And Horace hath this Verse,

    _Nec tamen ignorant, quid distent æra Lupinis_,

        to shew that counterfeit money (such as counters are with vs,
        or as these Lupines were vsed in those times) was easily knowne
        from true and currant coine. In English wee vsually call them
        after the Latine name, Lupines; and some after the Dutch name,
        Figge-beanes, because they are flat and round as a Figge that
        is pressed; and some Flat-beanes for the same reason. Some haue
        called the yellow Lupine, Spanish Violets: but other foolish
        names haue beene giuen it, as Virginia Roses, and the like,
        by knauish Gardiners and others, to deceiue men, and make
        them beleeue they were the finders out, or great preseruers
        of rarities, of no other purpose, but to cheate men of their
        money: as you would therefore auoyde knaues and deceiuers,
        beware of these manner of people, whereof the skirts of our
        towne are too pitifully pestered.


        The Vertues.

        The first or ordinary Lupine doth scoure and cleanse the skin
        from spots, morphew, blew markes, and other discolourings
        thereof, beeing vsed eyther in a decoction or pouther. Wee
        seldome vse it in inward medicines, not that it is dangerous,
        but of neglect, for formerly it hath beene much vsed for the
        wormes, &c.

]


1. _Lathyrus latifolius, siue Pisum perenne._   Pease euerlasting.

This kinde of wilde Pease that abideth long, and groweth euery yeare
greater then other, springeth vp with many broade trayling branches,
winged as it were on both the sides, diuersly diuided into other
smaller branches, at the seuerall ioynts whereof stand two hard, not
broad, but somewhat long greene leaues, and diuers twining claspers,
in sundry places with the leaues, from betweene the branches and the
leaues, at the ioynts towards the toppes, come forth diuers purplish
pease like blossomes, standing on a long stemme or stalke, very
beautifull to behold, and of a pretty sent or smell: after which come
small, long, thin, flat, hard skind cods, containing small round
blackish seede: the roote is great and thicke, growing downe deepe into
the ground, of the thicknesse sometimes of a mans arme, blackish on
the outside, and whitish within, with some branches and a few fibres
annexed thereunto.


2. _Orobus Venetus._   Blew vpright euerlasting Pease.

This pretty kinde of Pease blossome beareth diuers slender, but vpright
greene branches somewhat cornered, two foote high or thereabouts,
hauing at seuerall distances on both sides of them certaine winged
leaues, set together vpon long footestalkes one against another,
consisting of six or eight leaues, somewhat broade and pointed, and
without any odde one at the end: at the ioynts toward the toppes,
between the leaues and the stalkes, come forth many flowers set
together at the end of a pretty long footestalke, of the fashion of the
former Pease blossome, but somewhat smaller, and of a purplish violet
colour: after which come slender and long pointed pods rounder then
they, wherein is contained small round grayish pease: the roote is
blacke, hard or woody, abiding after seede bearing as the former doth,
and shooting afresh euery yeare.


3. _Lathyrus annuus filiquis orobi._   Partie coloured Cichelings.

This small Pulse or wild Pease, hath two or three long slender winged
branches, with smaller leaues thereon then the former, and without
any claspers at all on them: the flowers stand single, euery one by
it selfe, or two at the most together, the middle leaues whereof that
close together are white, and the vpper leaues of a reddish purple
colour: after which come long round flattish cods, bunched out in the
seuerall places where the seedes lye, like vnto the cods of _Orobus_ or
the bitter Vetch, but greater: the roote is small and dyeth euery yeare.


4. _Pisum quadratum._   The crimson blossomd or square codded Pease.

This pretty kinde of Pulse might very well for the forme of the leaues,
be referred to the kindes of _Lotus_ or Trefoiles: but because I haue
none of that kindred to entreate of in this Worke, I haue thought
fittest to place it here before the Medica’s, because both pods and
seedes are like also. It hath three or foure small weake stalkes,
diuided into many branches, hauing two stalkes of leaues at euery
ioynt, and three small soft leaues standing on a very small stalke,
comming from the ioynts: the flowers stand for the most part two
together, of a perfect red or crimson colour, like in forme almost vnto
a Pease blossome; after which come long thicke and round cods, with two
skinnes or filmes, running all along the cod at the backe or vpperside
and two other such like filmes, all along the belly or vnder side,
which make it seeme foure square, wherein there lye round discoloured
Pease, somewhat smaller and harder then ordinary Pease: the roote is
small and perisheth euery yeare.


5. _Medica Cochleata vulgaris._   Snailes or Barbary buttons.

The plant that beareth these pretty toyes for Gentlewomen, is somewhat
like vnto a Three leafed grasse or Trefoile, hauing many long trayling
branches lying vpon the ground, whereon at diuers places are three
small greene leaues, set together at the end of a little footestalke,
each of them a little snipt about the edges: at seuerall distances,
from the middle of these branches to the ends of them, come forth
the flowers, two for the most part standing together vpon a little
footstalke, which are of a pale yellow colour, very small, and of the
forme of a Pease blossome: after which come smooth heads, which are
turned or writhen round, almost like a Snaile, hard and greene at the
first, somewhat like a greene button (from the formes of both which
came their names) but afterwards growing whiter, more soft and open,
wherein lyeth yellowish round and flat seede, somewhat like vnto the
Kidney beane: the roote is small and stringie, dying downe euery yeare,
and must be new sowne in the spring, if you desire to haue it.


6. _Medica spinosa maior._   Prickly or thorny Snailes, or Buttons.

This kinde of _Medica_ is in all things very like vnto the former, both
in the long trayling branches, & three leaues alwaies growing together,
but a little greater pale yellow flowers, and crooked or winding heads:
but herein chiefly consisteth the difference, that this kinde hath his
heads or buttons harder, a little greater, more closed together, and
set with short and somewhat hard prickles, all the head ouer, which
being pulled open, haue those prickles standing on each side of the
filme or skinne, whereof the head consisteth, somewhat like vnto a fish
bone, and in this kinde goeth all one way; in which are contained such
like seedes for the forme, as are in the former, but great and blacke,
and shining withall.


7. _Medica spinosa altera._   Small thorney Buttons, or Snailes.

This other kinde is also like vnto the last described in all other
things, except in the heads or buttons, which are a little smaller, but
set with longer and softer prickes vpon the filmes, and may easily bee
discerned to goe both forwards and backewards, one enterlacing within
another, wherein are contained such like flat and blacke shining seede,
made after the fashion of a kidney, as are in the former, but somewhat
smaller: the roote perisheth in like manner euery yeare.


8. _Medica lata._   Broade Buttons.

This kinde differeth not from the first in leafe or flower, the fruite
onely hereof is broade and flat, and not so much twined as it.


9. _Medica Lunata._   Halfe Moones.

This is also a kinde of these Medicke fodders, hauing a trefoyle leafe
and yellow flowers like the former sorts, but both somewhat larger, the
chiefest difference consisteth in the head or fruite, which is broade
and flat, and not twined like the rest, but abideth halfe closed,
resembling a halfe Moone (and thereupon hath assumed both the Latine
and English name) wherein is contained flat seede, kidney fashion like
the former.


10. _Hedysarum clypeatum._   The red Sattin flower.

This red flowred Fitchling, hath many stalkes of winged faire greene
leaues, that is, of many set on both sides a middle ribbe, whereof
that at the end is the greatest of the rest: from the ioynts where the
leaues stand, come forth pretty long small stalkes, bearing on them
very many flowers, vp to the toppe one aboue another, of an excellent
shining red or crimson colour, very like vnto Sattin of that colour,
and sometimes of a white colour, (as Master William Coys, a Gentleman
of good respect in Essex, a great and ancient louer and cherisher of
these delights, and of all other rare plants, in his life time assured
me; he had growing in his garden at Stubbers by North Okenden) which
are somewhat large, and more closed together, almost flat and not
open, as in most of the other sorts: after the flowers are past, there
come rough, flat, round huskes, somewhat like vnto the old fashioned
round bucklers without pikes, three or foure standing one vpon or
aboue another, wherein are contained small brownish seede: the roote
perisheth the same yeare it beareth seede, for oftentimes it flowreth
not the first yeare it is sowne.


11. _Scorpioides maius & minus._   Great and small Caterpillers.

Vnder one description I comprehend both these sorts of Scorpions
grasse, or Caterpillers, or Wormes, as they are called by many,
whereof the greater hath been known but of late yeares; and ioyne them
to these pulses, not hauing a fitter place where to insert them. It
is but a small low plant, with branches lying vpon the ground, and
somewhat long, broad, and hard leaues thereon, among which come forth
small stalkes, bearing at the end for the most part, two small pale
yellowish flowers, like vnto Tares or Vetches, but smaller, which turne
into writhed or crooked tough cods; in the greater sort they are much
thicker, rounder and whiter, and lesser wound or turned together then
in the smaller, which are slenderer, more winding, yet not closing
like vnto the Snailes, and blacker more like vnto a Caterpiller then
the other, wherein are contained brownish yellow seede, much like vnto
a _Medica_: the rootes of both are small and fibrous, perishing euery
yeare.


        The Place.

        These are found seuerally in diuers and seuerall places, but
        wee sow and plant them vsually to furnish our Gardens.


        The Time.

        They doe all flower about the moneths of Iune and Iuly, and
        their seede is ripe soone after: but the second is earlier then
        the rest.


        The Names.

        The first is called _Clymenum_ of Matthiolus, and _Lathyris_ of
        Lobel and others: but _Lathyris_ in Greeke is _Cataputia_ in
        Latine, which is our Spurge, farre differing from this Pulse;
        and therefore _Lathyrus_ is more proper to distinguish them
        asunder, that two plants so farre vnlike should not bee called
        by one name: this is also called _Lathyrus latifolius_, because
        there is another called _angustifolius_, that differeth from it
        also: It is most vsually called with vs, _Pisum perenne_, and
        in English Pease blossome, or Pease euerlasting. The second is
        called by Clusius, _Orobus venetus_, because it was sent him
        from Venice, with another of the same kinde that bore white
        flowers; yet differeth but little or nothing from that kinde he
        found in Hungary, that I thinke the seuerall places of their
        growing only cause them to bear seuerall names, and to be the
        same in deede. Although I yeeld vnto Clusius the Latine name
        which doth not sufficiently content mee; yet I haue thought
        good to giue it a differing English name, according as it is
        in the title. The third, because I first receiued it among
        other seeds from Spaine, I haue giuen it the name, as it is
        entituled. The fourth is called of some _Sandalida Cretica_,
        & _Lotus filiquosus flore rubello_, _Lotus tetragonolobus_,
        _Pisum rubrum_, & _Pisum quadratum_: We vsually call it in
        English, Crimson Pease, or square Pease. The _Medica Cochleata_
        is called of Dodonæus _Trifolium Cochleatum_, but not iudged to
        be the true _Medica_. Wee call it in English, Medick fodder,
        Snailes Clouer, or as it is in the title, and so the rest
        of the Medica’s accordingly. The _Hedysarum clypeatum_ or
        _Securidaca_ is called of Dodonæus _Onobrichis altera_, and we
        in English for the likenesse, The red Sattin flower, although
        some foolishly call it, the red or French Honysuckle. The last
        is called by Lobel, _Scorpioides bupleurifolio_, I haue called
        it _minus_, because the greatest sort which came to me out of
        Spaine was not knowne vnto him; in English they are generally
        called Caterpillers.


        The Vertues.

        The Medica’s are generally thought to feede cattell fat much
        more then the Medow Trefoile, or Clouer grasse, and therefore
        I haue known diuers Gentlemen that haue plowed vp some of
        their pasture grounds, and sowen them with the seedes of some
        Medica’s to make the experience. All the other sorts are
        pleasures to delight the curious, and not any way profitable in
        Physicke that I know.




CHAP. LXXX.

_Pæonia._   Peonie.


There are two principall kindes of Peonie, that is to say, the Male and
the Female. Of the male kinde, I haue onely known one sort, but of the
Female a great many; which are thus to be distinguished. The male his
leafe is whole, without any particular diuision, notch or dent on the
edge, & his rootes long & round, diuided into many branches, somewhat
like to the rootes of Gentian or Elecampane, and not tuberous at all.
The Female of all sorts hath the leaues diuided or cut in on the edges,
more or lesse, and hath alwaies tuberous rootes, that is, like clogs
or Asphodill rootes, with many great thick round peeces hanging, or
growing at the end of smaller strings, and all ioyned to the toppe of
the maine roote.


1. _Pæonia mas._   The Male Peonie.

The Male Peonie riseth vp with many brownish stalkes, whereon doe
grow winged leaues, that is, many faire greene, and sometimes reddish
leaues, one set against another vpon a stalke, without any particular
diuision in the leafe at all: the flowers stand at the toppes of the
stalkes, consisting of fiue or six broade leaues, of a faire purplish
red colour, with many yellow threds in the middle, standing about the
head, which after riseth to be the seede vessels, diuided into two,
three or foure rough crooked pods like hornes, which when they are ful
ripe, open and turn themselues down one edge to another backeward,
shewing within them diuers round black shining seede, which are the
true seede, being full and good, and hauing also many red or crimson
graines, which are lancke and idle, intermixed among the blacke, as if
they were good seede, whereby it maketh a very pretty shew: the roots
are great, thick and long, spreading in the ground, and running downe
reasonable deepe.


2. _Pæonia fæmina vulgaris flore simplici._
The ordinary single Female Peonie.

This ordinary Female Peonie hath many stalkes, with more store of
leaues on them then the Male kinde hath, the leaues also are not so
large, but diuided or nicked diuersly on the edges, some with great
and deepe, and others with smaller cuts or diuisions, and of a darke
or dead greene colour: the flowers are of a strong heady sent, most
vsually smaller then the male, and of a more purple tending to a murrey
colour, with yellow thrumes about the head in the middle, as the male
kinde hath: the heads or hornes with seed are like also but smaller,
the seede also is blacke, but lesse shining: the rootes consist, as I
said, of many thicke and short tuberous clogs, fastened at the ends of
long strings, and all from the head of the roote, which is thicke and
short, and tuberous also, of the same or the like sent with the male.


3. _Pæonia fæmina vulgaris flore pleno rubro._   The double red Peonie.

This double Peonie as well as the former single, is so frequent in
euerie Garden of note, through euery Countrey, that it is almost labour
in vaine to describe it: but yet because I vse not to passe ouer any
plant so slightly, I will set down the description briefly, in regard
it is so common. It is very like unto the former single female Peony,
both in stalkes and leaues, but that it groweth somewhat higher, and
the leaues are of a fresher greene colour: the flowers at the tops of
the stalkes are very large, thicke and double (no flower that I know
so faire, great, and double; but not abiding blowne aboue eight or ten
daies) of a more reddish purple colour then the former female kinde,
and of a sweeter sent: after these flowers are past, sometimes come
good seed, which being sowne, bring forth some single flowers, and some
double: the rootes are tuberous, like vnto the former female.


4. _Pæonia fæmina flore carneo simplici._   The single blush Peony.

The single blush Peony hath his stalkes higher, and his leaues of a
paler or whiter greene colour then the double blush, and more white
vnderneath (so that it is very probable it is of another kinde, and not
risen from the seede of the double blush, as some might thinke) with
many veines, that are somewhat discoloured from the colour of the leafe
running through them: the flowers are very large and single, consisting
of fiue leaues for the most part, of a pale flesh or blush colour, with
an eye of yellow dispersed or mixed therewith, hauing many whitish
threads, tipt with yellow pendents standing about the middle head: the
rootes are like the other female Peonies.


5. _Pæonia fæmina flore pleno albicante._   The double blush Peony.

The double blush Peony hath not his stalkes so high as the double red,
but somewhat lower and stiffer, bearing such like winged leaues, cut
in or diuided here and there in the edges, as all these female kindes
are, but not so large as the last: the flowers are smaller, and lesse
double by a good deale then the former double red, of a faint shining
crimson colour at the first opening, but decaying or waxing paler euery
day: so that after it hath stood long (for this flower sheddeth not his
leaues in a great while) it will change somewhat whitish; and therefore
diuers haue ignorantly called it, the double white Peony: the seedes,
which sometimes it beareth, and rootes, are like vnto the former female
kindes, but somewhat longer, and of a brighter colour on the outside.


6. _Pæonia fæmina Byzantina._   The single red Peony of Constantinople.

This red Peony of Constantinople is very like in all things vnto the
double red Peonie, but that the flowers hereof are single, and as
large as the last, and that is larger then either the single female,
or the male kinde, consisting of eight leaues, of a deeper red colour
then either the single or double Peonies, and not purplish at all, but
rather of the colour of an ordinary red Tulipa, standing close and
round together: the roots of this kinde haue longer clogs, and not so
short as of the ordinary female kinde, and of a paler colour on the
outside.


        The Place.

        All these Peonies haue beene sent or brought from diuers parts
        beyond the Seas; they are endenized in our Gardens, where
        wee cherish them for the beauty and delight of their goodly
        flowers, as well as for their Physicall vertues.


        The Time.

        They all flower in May, but some (as I said) abide a small
        time, and others many weekes.

]


        The Names.

        The name _Pæonia_ is of all the later Writers generally
        giuen to these plants, although they haue had diuers other
        names giuen by the elder Writers, as _Rosa fatuina_, _Idæus
        dactylus_, _Aglaophotis_, and others, whereof to set downe
        the causes, reasons, and errours, were to spend more time then
        I intend for this worke. Wee call them in English, Peonie, and
        distinguish them according to their titles.


        The Vertues.

        The male Peony roote is farre aboue all the rest a most
        singular approued remedy for all Epilepticall diseases, in
        English, The falling sicknesse (and more especially the greene
        roote then the dry) if the disease be not too inueterate, to
        be boyled and drunke, as also to hang about the neckes of the
        younger sort that are troubled herewith, as I haue found it
        sufficiently experimented on many by diuers. The seede likewise
        is of especiall vse for women, for the rising of the mother.
        The seede of the female kinde, as well as the rootes, are most
        vsually sold, and may in want of the other be (and so are
        generally) vsed.




CHAP. LXXXI.

_Helleborus niger._   Beares foote.


There are three sorts of blacke Hellebor or Beares foote, one that
is the true and right kinde, whose flowers haue the most beautifull
aspect, and the time of his flowring most rare, that is, in the deepe
of Winter about Christmas, when no other can bee seene vpon the ground:
and two other that are wilde or bastard kindes, brought into many
Gardens for their Physicall properties; but I will only ioyne one of
them with the true kinde in this worke, and leaue the other for
another.


1. _Helleborus niger verus._
The true blacke Hellebor, or Christmas flower.

The true blacke Hellebor (or Beare foote as some would call it, but
that name doth more fitly agree with the other two bastard kindes)
hath many faire greene leaues rising from the roote, each of them
standing on a thicke round fleshly stiffe greene stalke, about an
hand breadth high from the ground, diuided into seuen, eight, or nine
parts or leaues, and each of them nicked or dented, from the middle
of the leafe to the pointward on both sides, abiding all the Winter,
at which time the flowers rise vp on such short thicke stalkes as the
leaues stand on, euery one by it selfe, without any leafe thereon for
the most part, or very seldome hauing one small short leafe not much
vnder the flower, and very little higher then the leaues themselues,
consisting of fiue broad white leaues, like vnto a great white single
Rose (which sometimes change to be either lesse or more purple about
the edges, as the weather or time of continuance doth effect) with many
pale yellow thrummes in the middle, standing about a greene head, which
after groweth to haue diuers cods set together, pointed at the ends
like hornes, somewhat like the seede vessels of the _Aconitum hyemale_,
but greater & thicker, wherein is contained long, round, and blackish
seede, like the seede of the bastard kindes: the rootes are a number of
brownish strings running downe deepe into the ground, and fastened to a
thicke head, of the bignesse of a finger at the toppe manie times, and
smaller still downewards.


2. _Helleboraster minor._
The lesser bastard blacke Hellebor, or Beare foote.

The smaller Beare foote is in most things like vnto the former true
blacke Hellebor; for it beareth also many leaues vpon short stalkes,
diuided into many leaues also, but each of them are long and narrow,
of a blacker greene colour, snipt or dented on both edges, which feele
somewhat hard or sharpe like prickes, and perish euery yeare, but rise
againe the next Spring: the flowers hereof stand on higher stalkes,
with some leaues on them also, although but very few, and are of a
pale, greene colour, like in forme vnto the flowers of the former,
but smaller, hauing also many greenish yellow threads or thrums in the
middle, and such like heads or seede vessels, and blackish seed: the
rootes are stringie and blackish like the former.


        The Place.

        The first groweth onely in the Gardens of those that are
        curious, and delight in all sorts of beautifull flowers in our
        Countrey, but wilde in many places of Germany, Italy, Greece,
        &c.

        The other groweth wilde in many places of England, as well
        as the other greater sort, which is not here described; for
        besides diuers places within eight or ten miles from London,
        I haue seen it in the Woods of Northamptonshire, and in other
        places.


        The Time.

        The first of these plants doth flower in the end of December,
        and beginning of Ianuary most vsually, and the other a moneth
        or two after, and sometime more.


        The Names.

        The first is called _Helleborus_, or _Elleborus niger verus_,
        and is the same that both Theophrastus and Dioscorides haue
        written of, and which was called _Melampodion_, of Melampus
        the Goateheard, that purged and cured the mad or melancholicke
        daughters of Prætus with the rootes thereof. Dodonæus calleth
        it _Veratrum nigrum primum_, and the other _secundum_: Wee
        call it in English, The true blacke Hellebor, or the Christmas
        flower, because (as I said) it is most commonly in flower at
        or before Christmas. The second is a bastard or wilde kinde
        thereof, it so nearely resembleth the true, and is called of
        most of the later Writers, _Pseudoelleborus niger minor_, or
        _Helleboraster minor_, for a distinction betweene it and the
        greater, which is not here described: and is called in English,
        The smaller or lesser Beare foote, and most vsed in Physicke,
        because it is more plentifull, yet it is more churlish and
        strong in operation then the true or former kinde.


        The Vertues.

        The rootes of both these kindes are safe medecines, being
        rightly prepared, to be vsed for all Melancholicke diseases,
        whatsoeuer others may feare or write, and may be without danger
        applied, so as care and skill, and not temerary rashnesse doe
        order and dispose of them.

        The powder of the dryed leaues, especially of the bastard
        kinde, is a sure remedy to kill the wormes in children,
        moderately taken.




CHAP. LXXXII.

_Elleborus albus._   White Ellebor or Neesewort.


There are two sorts of great white Ellebors or Neeseworts, whereas
there was but one kinde knowne to the Ancients; the other being found
out of later dayes: And although neither of both these haue any beauty
in their flowers, yet because their leaues, being faire and large, haue
a goodly prospect, I haue inserted them in this place, that this Garden
should not be vnfurnished of them, and you not vnacquainted with them.


1. _Elleborus albus vulgaris._   White Ellebor or Neesing roote.

The first great white Ellebor riseth at the first out of the ground,
with a whitish greene great round head, which growing vp, openeth it
selfe into many goodly faire large greene leaues, plaited or ribbed
with eminent ribbes all along the leaues, compassing one another at
the bottome, in the middle whereof riseth vp a stalke three foot
high or better, with diuers such like leaues thereon, but smaller to
the middle thereof; from whence to the toppe it is diuided into many
branches, hauing many small yellowish, or whitish greene starre-like
flowers all along vpon them, which after turne into small, long, three
square whitish seede, standing naked, without any huske to containe
them, although some haue written otherwise: the roote is thicke and
reasonable great at the head, hauing a number of great white strings
running downe deepe into the ground, whereby it is strongly fastened.


2. _Elleborus albus præcox siue atrorubente flore._
The early white Ellebor with reddish flowers.

This other Ellebor is very like the former, but that it springeth vp
a moneth at the least before it, and that the leaues are not fully
so thicke or so much plaited, but as large or larger, and doe sooner
perish and fall away from the plant: the stalke hereof is as high
as the former, bearing such like starry flowers, but of a darke or
blackish red colour: the seede is like the other: the roote hath no
such head as the other (so farre as I haue obserued, both by mine own
and others plants) but hath many long white strings fastened to the
top, which is as it were a long bulbous scaly head, out of which spring
the leaues.


        The Place.

        The first groweth in many places of Germany, as also in some
        parts of Russia, in that aboundance, by the relation of that
        worthy, curious, and diligent searcher and preseruer of all
        natures rarities and varieties, my very good friend, Iohn
        Tradescante, often heretofore remembred, that, as hee said, a
        good ship might be loaden with the rootes hereof, which hee saw
        in an Island there.

        The other likewise groweth in the vpland wooddy grounds of
        Germanie, and other the parts thereabouts.


        The Time.

        The first springeth vp in the end or middle of March, and
        flowreth in Iune. The second springeth in February, but
        flowreth not vntill Iune.


        The Names.

        The first is called _Elleborus albus_, or _Helleborus albus_,
        the letter _H_, as all Schollers know, being but _aspirationis
        nota_: and _Veratrum album flore viridante_, of some _Sanguis
        Herculis_. The other is called _Elleborus albus præcox_, and
        _flore atrorubente_, or _atropurpurante_. We call the first in
        English, White Ellebor, Neesewort, or Neesing roote, because
        the powder of the roote is vsed to procure neesing; and I call
        it the greater, in regard of those in the next Chapter. The
        other hath his name according to the Latine title, most proper
        for it.


        The Vertues.

        The force of purging is farre greater in the roote of this
        Ellebor, then in the former; and therefore is not carelessly
        to bee vsed, without extreame danger; yet in contumatious
        and stubborne diseases it may bee vsed with good caution
        and aduice. There is a Syrupe or Oxymel made hereof in the
        Apothecaries shops, which as it is dangerous for gentle and
        tender bodies, so it may be very effectuall in stronger
        constitutions. Pausanias _in Phocicis_, recordeth a notable
        stratagem that Solon vsed in besieging the Citie of Cirrheus,
        _viz._ That hauing cut off the riuer Plistus from running into
        the Citie, he caused a great many of these rootes to be put
        into a quantity thereof, which after they had steeped long
        enough therein, and was sufficiently infected therewith, he let
        passe into the Citie againe: whereof when they had greedily
        drunke, they grew so weake and feeble by the superpurgation
        thereof, that they were forced to leaue their wals vnmand,
        and not guarded, whereby the Amphyctions their enemies became
        masters of their Citie. The like stratagems are set downe by
        diuers other Authors, performed by the helpe of other herbes.




CHAP. LXXXIII.

_Elleborine._   Small or wilde white Ellebor.


The likenesse of the leaues of these plants, rather then any other
faculty with the former white Ellebor, hath caused them to be called
_Elleborine_, as if they were smaller white Ellebors. And I for the
same cause haue ioyned them next, whereof there are found many sorts:
One which is the greater kinde, is of greatest beauty; the other which
are lesser differ not much one from another, more then in the colour
of the flowers, whereof I will onely take three, being of the most
beautie, and leaue the rest to another worke.


1. _Helleborine vel Elleborine maior, siue Calceolus Mariæ._
Our Ladies Slipper.

This most beautifull plant of all these kindes, riseth vp with diuers
stalkes, a foote and a halfe high at the most, bearing on each side
of them broad greene leaues, somewhat like in forme vnto the leaues
of the white Ellebor, but smaller and not so ribbed, compassing the
stalke at the lower end; at the tops of the stalkes come forth one, or
two, or three flowers at the most, one aboue another, vpon small short
foote-stalkes, with a small leafe at the foote of euery stalke: each
of these flowers are of a long ouall forme, that is, more long then
round, and hollow withall, especially at the vpper part, the lower
being round and swelling like a belly: at the hollow part there are two
small peeces like eares or flippets, that at the first doe couer the
hollow part, and after stand apart one from another, all which are of a
fine pale yellow colour, in all that I haue seene (yet it is said there
are some found, that are more browne or tending to purple) there are
likewise foure long, narrow, darke coloured leaues at the setting on of
the flower vnto the stalke, wherein as it were the flower at the first
standeth: the whole flower is of a pretty small sent: the seede is very
small, very like vnto the seede of the _Orchides_ or Satyrions, and
contained in such like long pods, but bigger: the roots are composed of
a number of strings enterlacing themselues one within another, lying
within the vpper crust of the earth, & not spreading deep, of a darke
brownish colour.


2. _Elleborine minor flore albo._
The small or wilde white Ellebor with a white flower.

This smaller wilde white Ellebor riseth vp in the like manner vnto the
former, and not much lower, bearing such like leaues, but smaller, and
of a winter greene colour, almost of the colour and fashion of the
leaues of Lilly Conually; the top of the stalke hath many more flowers,
but lesser, growing together, spike-fashion, with small short leaues
at the stalke of euery flower, which consisteth of fiue small white
leaues, with a small close hood in the middle, without any sent at all;
the seede and seede vessels are like vnto the former, but smaller: the
rootes are many small strings, dispersing themselues in the ground.


3. _Elleborine minor flore purpurante._
The small or wilde white Ellebor with blush flowers.

The leaues of this kinde are like vnto the last described, but somewhat
narrower: the stalkes and flowers are alike, but smaller also, and of a
pale purplish or blush colour, which causeth the difference.


        The Place.

        The first groweth in very many places of Germany, and in other
        Countries also. It groweth likewise in Lancashire, neare vpon
        the border of Yorkeshire, in a wood or place called the Helkes,
        which is three miles from Ingleborough, the highest Hill in
        England, and not farre from Ingleton, as I am informed by a
        courteous Gentlewoman, a great louer of these delights, called
        Mistris Thomasin Tunstall, who dwelleth at Bull-banke, neare
        Hornby Castle in those parts, and who hath often sent mee vp
        the rootes to London, which haue borne faire flowers in my
        Garden. The Second groweth in many places of England, and with
        the same Gentlewoman also before remembred, who sent me one
        plant of this kinde with the other. The last I haue not yet
        knowne to growe in England; but no doubt many things doe lye
        hid, and not obserued, which in time may bee discouered, if
        our Country Gentlemen and women, and others, in their seuerall
        places where they dwell, would be more carefull and diligent,
        and be aduertised either by themselues, or by others capable
        and fit to be imployed, as occasion and time might serue, to
        finde out such plants as growe in any the circuits or limits of
        their habitations, or in their trauels, as their pleasures or
        affaires leade them. And because ignorance is the chiefe cause
        of neglect of many rare things, which happen to their view at
        sometimes, which are not to be seene againe peraduenture, or
        not in many yeares after, I would heartily aduise all men of
        meanes, to be stirred vp to bend their mindes, and spend a
        little more time and trauell in these delights of herbes and
        flowers, then they haue formerly done, which are not onely
        harmlesse, but pleasurable in their time, and profitable in
        their vse. And if any would be better enformed, and certified
        of such things they know not, I would be willing and ready to
        my best skill to aduertise them, that shall send any thing vp
        to me where I dwell in London. Thus farre I haue digressed from
        the matter in hand, and yet not without some good vse I hope,
        that others may make of it.


        The Time.

        The two first flower earlier then the last, and both the first
        about one time, that is, in the end of Aprill, or beginning of
        May. The last in the end of May, or in Iune.


        The Names.

        The first is called _Elleborine recentiorum maior_, and
        _Calceolus Mariæ_: Of some thought to be _Cosmosandalos_,
        because it is _Sandali forma_. In English we call it our Ladies
        Slipper, after the Dutch name. The other two lesser kinds haue
        their names in their titles: I haue thought it fit to adde the
        title of small white Ellebors vnto these, for the forme sake,
        as is before said.


        The Vertues.

        There is no vse of these in Physicke in our dayes that I know.




CHAP. LXXXIIII.

_Lilium Conuallium._   Lilly Conually.


The remembrance of the Conuall Lilly, spoken of in the precedent
Chapter, hath caused me to insert these plants among the rest, although
differing both in face and properties; but lest it should lose all
place, let it keepe this. It is of two sorts, differing chiefly in the
colour of the flowers, the one being white, and the other reddish, as
shall be shewed in their descriptions following.


1. _Lilium Conuallium flore albo._   The white Lilly Conually.

The white Conuall or May Lilly, hath three or foure leaues rising
together from the roote, one enclosed within another, each whereof
when it is open is long and broad, of a grayish shining greene colour,
somewhat resembling the leaues of the former wilde Neesewort, at the
side whereof, and sometime from the middle of them, riseth vp a small
short naked foote-stalke, an hand breadth high or somewhat more,
bearing at the toppe one aboue another many small white flowers, like
little hollow bottles with open mouths, nicked or cut into fiue or
six notches, turning all downewards one way, or on one side of the
stalke, of a very strong sweete sent, and comfortable for the memory
and senses, which turne into small red berries, like vnto Asparagus,
wherein is contained hard white seede: the rootes runne vnder ground,
creeping euery way, consisting of many small white strings.


2. _Lilium Conuallium flore rubente._   May Lillies with red flowers.

This other May Lilly differeth neither in roote, leafe, nor forme of
flower from that before, but onely in the colour of the flower, which
is of a fine pale red colour, being in my iudgement not altogether so
sweet as the former.


        The Place.

        The first groweth aboundantly in many places of England. The
        other is a stranger, and groweth only in the Gardens of those
        that are curious louers of rarities.


        The Time.

        They both flower in May, and the berries are ripe in August.


        The Names.

        The Latines haue no other name for this plant but _Lilium
        Conuallium_, although some would haue it to be _Lilium vernum_
        of Theophrastus, and others _Oenanthe_ of the same Author.
        Gesner thinketh it to be _Callionymus_. Lonicerus to be
        _Cacalia_, and Fuchsius to be _Ephemerum non lethale_: but they
        are all for the most part mistaken. We call it in English Lilly
        Conually, May Lilly, and of some Liriconfancie.


        The Vertues.

        The flowers of the white kinde are often vsed with those things
        that help to strengthen the memory, and to procure ease to
        Apoplecticke persons. Camerarius setteth downe the manner of
        making an oyle of the flowers hereof, which he saith is very
        effectuall to ease the paines of the Goute, and such like
        diseases, to be vsed outwardly, which is thus: Hauing filled a
        glasse with the flowers, and being well stopped, set it for a
        moneths space in an Ants hill, and after being drayned cleare,
        set it by to vse.




CHAP. LXXXV.

_Gentiana._   Gentian or Fell-wort.


There are diuers sorts of Gentians or Fell-wortes, some greater, others
lesser, and some very small; many of them haue very beautifull flowers,
but because some are very suddenly past, before one would thinke they
were blowne open, and others will abide no culture and manuring, I will
onely set forth vnto you two of the greater sorts, and three of the
lesser kindes, as fittest, and more familiarly furnishing our gardens,
leauing the rest to their wilde habitations, and to bee comprehended in
a generall Worke.


1. _Gentiana maior flore flauo._   The great Gentian.

The great Gentian riseth vp at the first, with a long, round and
pointed head of leaues, closing one another, which after opening
themselues, lye vpon the ground, and are faire, long and broad,
somewhat plaited or ribbed like vnto the leaues of white Ellebor or
Neeseworte, but not so fairely or eminently plaited, neyther so stiffe,
but rather resembling the leaues of a great Plantane: from among which
riseth vp a stiffe round stalke, three foote high or better, full of
ioynts, hauing two such leaues, but narrower and smaller at euery
ioynt, so compassing about the stalke at the lower end of them, that
they will almost hold water that falleth into them: from the middle of
the stalke to the toppe, it is garnished with many coronets or rundles
of flowers, with two such greene leaues likewise at euery ioynt,
and wherein the flowers doe stand, which are yellow, layd open like
starres, and rising out of small greenish huskes, with some threds in
the middle of them, but of no sent at all, yet stately to behold, both
for the order, height and proportion of the plant: the seede is browne
and flat, contained in round heads, somewhat like vnto the seede of
the _Fritillaria_, or checkerd Daffodill, but browner: the rootes are
great, thicke and long, yellow, and exceeding bitter.


2. _Gentiana maior folio Asclepiadis._   Swallow-wort Gentian.

This kinde of Gentian hath many stalkes rising from the roote, neere
two foote high, whereon grow many faire pale greene leaues, set by
couples, with three ribs in euery one of them, and doe somewhat
resemble the leaues of _Asclepias_ or Swallow-wort, that is, broade at
the bottome, and sharpe at the point: the flowers grow at the seuerall
ioynts of the stalkes, from the middle vpwards, two or three together,
which are long and hollow, like vnto a bell flower, ending in fiue
corners, or pointed leaues, and folded before they are open, as the
flowers of the Bindeweedes are, of a faire blew colour, sometimes
deeper, and sometimes paler: the heads or seede vessels haue two points
or hornes at the toppes, and containe within them flat grayish seed,
like vnto the former, but lesse: the rootes hereof are nothing so great
as the former, but are yellow, small and long, of the bignesse of a
mans thumbe.


3. _Gentiana minor Cruciata._   Crosse-wort Gentian.

This small Gentian hath many branches lying vpon the ground, scarce
lifting themselues vpright, and full of ioynts, whereat grow vsually
foure leaues, one opposite vnto another, in manner of a Crosse, from
whence it tooke his name, in shape very like vnto _Saponaria_ or
Sopewort, but shorter, and of a darker greene colour: at the tops of
the stalkes stand many flowers, thick thrusting together, and likewise
at the next ioynt vnderneath, euery one of them standing in a darke
blewish greene huske, and consisting of fiue small leaues, the points
or ends whereof only appeare aboue the huskes wherein they stand, and
are hardly to be seene, but that they are of a fine pale blew colour,
and that many grow together: the seed is small and brown, hard, and
somewhat like vnto the seed of the Marian Violets, or Couentry bels:
the roots are small and whitish, dispersing themselues diuersly in the
ground, of as bitter a taste almost as the rest


[Illustration:

   1 _Lilium Conuallium._ Liricon fancy or Lilly Conually.
   2 _Gentiana maior._ The great Gentian.
   3 _Gentianella verna._ Small Gentian of the Spring.
   4 _Gentiana Cruciata._ Crossewort Gentian.
   5 _Pneumonanthe seu Gentiana Autumnalis._ Autumne Gentian.
   6 _Saponaria flore duplici._ Double flowred Sopewort.
   7 _Plantago Rosea._ Rose Plantane.
]


4. _Gentianella Verna._   Small Gentian of the Spring.

The small Gentian of the Spring hath diuers small hard greene leaues,
lying vpon the ground, as it were in heads or tufts, somewhat broade
below, and pointed at the end, with fiue ribs or veines therein, as
conspicuous as in the former Gentians, among which riseth vp a small
short stalke, with some smaller leaues thereon, at the toppe whereof
standeth one faire, large, hollow flower, made bell fashion, with
wide open brimmes, ending in fiue corners or diuisions, of the most
excellent deepe blew colour that can be seene in any flower, with some
white spots in the bottome on the inside: after the flower is past,
there appeare long and round pods, wherein are contained small blackish
seede: the rootes are small, long, pale yellow strings, which shoot
forth here and there diuers heads of leaues, and thereby encrease
reasonable well, if it finde a fit place, and ground to grow, or else
will not be noursed vp, with all the care and diligence can be vsed:
the whole plant is bitter, but not so strong as the former.


5. _Gentiana Autumnalis siue Pneumonanthe._
Calathian Violet or Autumne Gentian.

This Gentian that flowreth in Autumne, hath in some places higher
stalkes then in others, with many leaues thereon, set by couples as
in other Gentians, but long and narrow, yet shewing the three ribbes
or veines that are in each of them: the toppes of the stalkes are
furnished euery one with a flower or two, of an excellent blew purple
colour, ending in fiue corners, and standing in long huskes: the rootes
are somewhat great at the top, and spreading into many small yellow
strings, bitter as the rest are.


6. _Saponaria flore duplici._   Double flowred Sopeworte.

Vnto these kindes of Gentians, I must needes adde these following
plants, for that the former is of some neere resemblance in leafe with
some of the former. And because the ordinary Sopeworte or Bruiseworte
with single flowers is often planted in Gardens, and the flowers serue
to decke both the garden and the house; I may vnder the one describe
them both: for this with double flowers is farre more rare, and of
greater beautie. It hath many long and slender round stalkes, scarce
able to sustaine themselues, and stand vpright, being ful of ioynts
and ribbed leaues at them, euery one somewhat like a small Gentian
or Plantane leafe: at the toppes of the stalkes stand many flowers,
consisting of two or three rowes of leaues, of a whitish or pale purple
colour, and of a strong sweet sent, somewhat like the smell of Iasmin
flowers, standing in long and thicke pale greene huskes, which fall
away without giuing any seede, as most other double flowers doe that
encrease by the roote, which spreadeth within the ground, and riseth vp
in sundry distant places like the single.


7. _Plantago Rosea._   Rose Plantane.

This other plant is in all things like vnto the ordinary Plantane or
Ribworte, that groweth wilde abroade in many places, whose leaues are
very large: but instead of the long slender spike, or eare that the
ordinary hath, this hath eyther a thicke long spike of small greene
leaues vpon short stalkes, or else a number of such small greene leaues
layd round-wise like vnto a Rose, and sometimes both these may be seene
vpon one and the same roote, at one and the same time, which abide a
great while fresh vpon the roote, and sometimes also giueth seede,
especially from the more long and slender spikes.


        The Place.

        Some of these Gentians grow on the toppes of hils, and some on
        the sides and foote of them in Germany and other Countreyes:
        some of them also vpon barren heaths in those places, as also
        in our owne Countrey, especially the Autumne Gentian, and as
        it is reported, the Vernall likewise. The single or ordinary
        Sopeworte is found wilde in many places with vs, but the double
        came to vs from beyond the Sea, and is scarce known or heard of
        in England. The Rose Plantaine hath beene long in England, but
        whether naturall thereof or no, I am not assured.


        The Time.

        They flower for the most part in Iune and Iuly, but the small
        Gentian of the Spring flowreth somewhat earlier, and that of
        the Autumne in August and September.


        The Names.

        _Gentiana_ is the generall name giuen to the Gentians. We call
        them in English Gentian, Fellworte, Bitterwort, and Baldmoney.
        _Saponaria_ taketh his name from the scouring qualitie it hath:
        Wee call it in English Sopewort, and in some places Bruisewort.
        Some haue thought it to bee _Struthium_ of Dioscorides, or
        at least haue vsed it for the same causes, but therein they
        are greatly deceiued, as Matthiolus hath very well obserued
        thereon, and so is Dodonæus, that thought it to be _Alisma_.
        The Rose Plantaine is so called of the double spikes it
        carrieth.


        The Vertues.

        The wonderfull wholsomnesse of Gentian cannot bee easily knowne
        to vs, by reason our daintie tastes refuse to take thereof,
        for the bitternesse sake: but otherwise it would vndoubtedly
        worke admirable cures, both for the liuer, stomacke and lunges.
        It is also a speciall counterpoison against any infection, as
        also against the violence of a mad dogges tooth: wilde Sopewort
        is vsed in many places, to scoure the countrey womens treen,
        and pewter vessels, and physically some make great boast to
        performe admirable cures in Hydropicall diseases, because it
        is diureticall, and in _Lue Veneria_, when other Mercuriall
        medicines haue failed. The Rose Plantaine no doubt hath the
        same qualities that the ordinary hath.




CHAP. LXXXVI.

_Campanula._   Bell-flowers.


Under the title of Bell-flowers are to bee comprehended in this
Chapter, not only those that are ordinarily called _Campanula_, but
_Viola Mariana_, and _Trachelium_ also, whereof the one is called
Couentry, the other Canterbury Bells.


1. _Campanula Persicifolia alba, vel cærulea._
Peach-leafed Bell-flowers white or blew.

The Peach-leafed Bell-flower hath many tufts, or branches of leaues
lying vpon the ground, which are long and narrow, somewhat like vnto
the leafe of an Almond or Peach tree, being finely nicked about the
edges, and of a sad greene colour, from among which rise vp diuers
stalkes, two foote high or more, set with leaues to the middle, and
from thence vpwards, with many flowers standing on seuerall small
foote-stalkes, one aboue another, with a small leafe at the foote of
euery one; the flowers stand in small greene huskes, being small and
round at the bottome, but wider open at the brimme, and ending in fiue
corners, with a three forked clapper in the middle, set about with some
small threds tipt with yellow, which flowers in some plants are pure
white, and in others of a pale blew or watchet colour, hauing little or
no sent at all: the seede is small, and contained in round flat heads,
or seede vessels: the roote is very small, white and threddy, creeping
vnder the vpper crust of the ground, so that oftentimes the heat and
drought of the Summer will goe near to parch and wither it vtterly: it
requireth therefore to be planted in some shadowie place.


2. _Campanula maior, siue Pyramidalis._
The great or steeple Bell-flower.

This great Bell-flower hath diuers stalkes, three foote high or
better, whereon grow diuers smooth, darke, greene leaues, broade at
the bottome, and small at the point, somewhat vneuenly notched about
the edges, and standing vpon longer footestalkes below then those
aboue: the flowers are blew, and in some white, not so great or large
as the former, but neare of the same fashion, growing thicker and more
plentifully together, with smaller leaues among them, burning thicke
below, and rising smaller and thinner vp to the toppe, in fashion of a
_Pyramis_ or speere Steeple: the roote is thicke and whitish, yeelding
more store of milke being broken (as the leaues and stalks also doe)
then any other of the Bell-flowers, euery one whereof doe yeelde milke,
some more and some lesse.


3. _Viola Mariana flore albido vel purpureo._
Couentry Bels white or purple.

The leaues of Couentry Bels are of a pale or fresh greene colour,
long, and narrow next vnto the bottome, and broader from the middle
to the end, and somewhat round pointed, a little hairy all ouer, and
snipt about the edges: the stalkes rise vp the yeare after the sowing,
being somewhat hairy also, and branching forth from the roote, into
diuers parts, whereon stand diuers leaues, smaller then the former,
and of a darker greene colour: at the end of euery branch stand the
flowers, in greene huskes, from whence come large, round, hollow Bels,
swelling out in the middle, and rising somewhat aboue it, like the
necke of a pot, and then ending in fiue corners, which are either of a
faire or faint white, or of a pale blew purplish colour, and sometimes
of a deeper purple or violet: after the flowers are past, there rise
vp great square, or cornered seede vessels, wherein is contained in
diuers diuisions, small, hard, shining, browne, flat seeds: the roote
is white, and being young as in the first yeares sowing, is tender,
and often eaten as other Rampions are; but the next yeare, when it
runneth vp to seede, it groweth hard, and perisheth: so that it is to
be continued by euery other yeares sowing.


4. _Trachelium maius flore albo vel purpureo._
Great Canterbury Bels white or purple.

The greater Canterbury Bels, or Throateworte, hath many large rough
leaues, somewhat like vnto Nettle leaues, being broad and round at the
bottome, and pointed at the end, notched or dented on the edges, and
euery one standing on a long footstalk: among these leaues rise vp
diuers square rough stalkes, diuided at the toppe into diuers branches,
whereon grow the like leaues as grow below, but lesser; toward the ends
of the branches stand the flowers, mixed with some longer leaues, euery
one in his seuerall huske, which are hollow, long and round, like a
bell or cup, wide open at the mouth, and cut at the brimme into fiue
corners, or diuisions, somewhat lesser then the Couentry Bels, in some
of a pure white, and others of a faire deepe purple violet colour, and
sometimes paler: after the flowers are past, come smaller and rounder
heades then in the former, containing flat seede, but blacker, and
not so redde as the last: the roote is hard and white, dispersing it
selfe into many branches vnder ground, not perishing euery yeare as the
former (although it loseth all the leaues in winter) but abiding many
yeares, and encreasing into diuers heades or knobs, from whence spring
new leaues and branches.

5. _Trachelium maius flore duplici albo & cæruleo._
Canterbury Bels with double flowers both white and blew.

Of this kinde of Throateworte or Canterbury Bels, there is another
sort, not differing in any thing from the former, but in the
doublenesse of the flower: For there is of both the kindes, one that
beareth double white flowers, and the other blew: Of each whereof I
receiued plants from friends beyond the Sea, which grow well with me.


6. _Trachelium Giganteum flore purpurante._
Pale purple Giants Throateworte.

This Bell-flower, although it hath a Gigantine name, yet did I neuer
perceiue it in my garden, to rise vp higher then the former, the
epithite beeing in my perswasion, only giuen for difference sake: the
leaues whereof are not so rough, but as large, and dented about the
edges, somewhat larger pointed, and of a fresher greene colour: the
stalkes beare such like leaues on them, but more thinly or dispersedly
set, hauing a flower at the setting on of euery one of the leaues,
from the middle vpwards, and are somewhat like the great Throateworte
in forme, but of a pale or bleake reddish purple colour, turning the
brims or corners a little backwards, with a forked clapper in the
middle, sufficient eminent and yellow: the seede hereof is white, and
plentifull in the heads, which will abide all the winter vpon the
stalkes, vntill all the seede being shed, the heads remaining seeme
like torne rags, or like thin peeces of skin, eaten with wormes: the
roote is great, thicke and white, abiding long without perishing.

[Sidenote: _Flore albo._]

There is another which differeth not any thing but in the flower, which
is white.


7. _Trachelium minus flore albo & purpureo._
Small Throateworte or Canterbury Bells both white and purple.

The lesser Throateworte hath smaller leaues, nothing so broade or hard
as the former great kinde, but long, and little or nothing dented about
the edges: the stalkes are square and brownish, if it beare purple
flowers, and greene if it beare white flowers, which in forme are
alike, and grow in a bush or tuft, thicke set together, more then any
of the former, and smaller also, being not much bigger then the flowers
of the fielde, or garden Rampions: the roote is lasting, and shooteth
afresh euery yeare.


8. _Trachelium Americanum flore ruberrimo, siue Planta Cardinalis._
The rich crimson Cardinals flower.

This braue plant, from a white roote spreading diuers wayes vnder
ground, sendeth forth many greene leaues, spread round about the head
thereof, each whereof is somewhat broade and long, and pointed at
the end, finely also snipt about the edges; from the middle whereof
ariseth vp a round hollow stalke, two foote high at the least, beset
with diuers such leaues as grow below, but longer below then aboue, and
branching out at the toppe aboundantly, euery branch bearing diuers
greene leaues on them, and one at the foote of euery of them also,
the toppes whereof doe end in a great large tuft of flowers, with a
small greene leafe at the foote of the stalke of euery flower, each
footestalke being about an inch long, bearing a round greene huske,
diuided into fiue long leaues or points turned downwards, and in the
midst of euery of them a most rich crimson coloured flower, ending in
fiue long narrow leaues, standing all of them foreright, but three of
them falling downe, with a long vmbone set as it were at the backe of
them, bigger below, and smaller aboue, and at the toppe a small head,
being of a little paler colour then the flower, but of no sent or smell
at all, commendable only for the great bush of so orient red crimson
flowers: after the flowers are past, the seede commeth in small heads,
closed within those greene husks that held the flowers, which is very
like vnto the seede vessels of the _Viola Mariana_, or Couentry Bels,
and is small and brownish.


        The Place.

        All these Bell-flowers do grow in our Gardens, where they are
        cherished for the beautie of their flowers. The Couentry Bels
        doe not grow wilde in any of the parts about Couentry, as I am
        credibly informed by a faithfull Apothecary dwelling there,
        called Master Brian Ball, but are noursed in Gardens with them,
        as they are in other places. The last groweth neere the riuer
        of Canada, where the French plantation in America is seated.


        The Time.

        They flower from May vntill the end of Iuly or August, and
        in the mean time the seed is ripe: But the Peache-leafed
        Bell-flowers, for the most part, flower earlier then the other.


        The Names.

        The first is generally called _Campanula Perficifolia_,
        in English Peach-leafed Bell-flower. The second is called
        _Campanula maior_, _Campanula lactescens Pyramidalis_, and
        _Pyramidalis Lutetiana_ of Lobel, in English, Great or Steeple
        Bell-flower. The third is vsually called _Viola Mariana_, and
        of some _Viola Marina_. Lobel putteth a doubt whether it be not
        _Medium_ of Dioscorides, as Matthiolus and others doe thinke;
        but in my opinion the thicknesse of the roote, as the text hath
        it, contradicteth all the rest. We call it generally in English
        Couentry Bels. Some call it Marian, and some Mercuries Violets.
        The fourth and fift are called _Trachelium_ or _Cervicaria_,
        of some _Vvularia_, because many haue vsed it to good purpose,
        for the paines of the _Vvula_, or Throate: Yet there is another
        plant, called also by some _Vvularia_, which is _Hippoglossum_,
        Horse tongue, or Double tongue. The sixt hath his title to
        descipher it out sufficiently, as is declared. The seuenth is
        called _Trachelium minus_, and _Ceruicaria minor_, of some
        _Saponaria altera_; in English, Small Throateworte, or Small
        Canterbury Bels. The last hath his name in the title, as it is
        called in France, from whence I receiued plants for my Garden
        with the Latine name: but I haue giuen it in English.


        The Vertues.

        The Peach-Bels as well as the others may safely bee vsed in
        gargles and lotions for the mouth, throate, or other parts, as
        occasion serueth. The rootes of many of them, while they are
        young, are often eaten in sallets by diuers beyond the Seas.




CHAP. LXXXVII.

_Campana Cærulea siue Convolvulus Cæruleus._
Blew Bell flowers, or blew Bindeweede.


There are two other kindes of Bell-flowers, much differing from the
Tribe or Familie of the former, because of their climbing or winding
qualitie, which I must needes place next them, for the likenesse of the
flowers, although otherwise they might haue beene placed with the other
clamberers that follow. Of these there is a greater, and a lesser, and
of each likewise some difference, as shall be declared.


1. _Convolvulus cæruleus maior rotundifolius._
The greater blew Bindweede, or Bell-flower with round leaues.

This goodly plant riseth vp with many long and winding branches,
whereby it climbeth and windeth vpon any poles, herbes, or trees,
that stand neare it within a great compasse, alwaies winding it selfe
contrary to the course of the Sunne: on these branches doe growe many
faire great round leaues, and pointed at the end, like vnto a Violet
leafe in shape, but much greater, of a sad greene colour: at the ioynts
of the branches, where the leaues are set, come forth flowers on pretty
long stalkes, two or three together at a place, which are long, and
pointed almost like a finger, while they are buds, and not blowne
open, and of a pale whitish blew colour, but being blowne open, are
great and large bels, with broad open mouths or brims ending in fine
corners, and small at the bottome, standing in small greene huskes of
fine leaues: these flowers are of a very deepe azure or blew colour,
tending to a purple, very glorious to behold, opening for the most part
in the euening, abiding so all the night and the next morning, vntill
the Sunne begin to growe somewhat hot vpon them, and then doe close,
neuer opening more: the plant carrieth so many flowers, if it stand in
a warme place, that it will be replenished plentifully, vntill the cold
ayres and euenings stay the luxury thereof: after the flowers are past,
the stalkes whereon the flowers did stand, bend downwards, and beare
within the huskes three or foure blacke seedes, of the bignesse of a
Tare or thereabouts: the rootes are stringy, and perish euery yeare.


2. _Convolvulus trifolius siue hederaceus purpureus._
The greater purple Bindeweede, or Bell-flower with cornered leaues.

The growing and forme of this Bindeweede or Bell-flower, is all one
with the former, the chiefest differences consisting in the forme of
the leafe, which in this is three cornered, like vnto an Iuie leafe
with corners; and in the flower, which is of a deeper blew, tending
more to a deepe purple Violet, and somewhat more reddish in the fiue
plaites of each flower, as also in the bottomes of the flowers.


3. _Convolvulus tenuifolius Americanus._
The red Bell-flower of America.

Although this rare plant (because wee seldome haue it, and can as
hardly keepe it) be scarce knowne in these cold Countries, yet I could
not but make mention of it, to incite those that haue conueniencie to
keepe it, to be furnished of it. It springeth vp at the first from
the seede with two leaues, with two long forked ends, which abide a
long time before they perish, betweene which riseth vp the stalke or
stemme, branching forth diuers waies, being of a brownish colour, which
windeth it selfe as the former great Bell-flower doth, whereon are set
at seuerall ioynts diuers winged leaues, that is to say, many small
narrow and long leaues set on both sides of the middle ribbe, and one
at the end: from these ioynts arise long stalkes, at the ends whereof
stand two or three small, long, hollow flowers, fashioned very like
vnto the flowers of a Bindeweede, or the flowers of Tabacco, and ending
in the like manner in fiue points, but not so much laide open, being of
a bright red colour, plaited as the Bindeweedes or Bell-flowers before
they be open, with some few threads in the middle, which turne into
long pointed cods, wherein is contained long and blacke seede, tasting
hot like Pepper: the roote is small and stringy, perishing euery yeare,
and with vs will seldome come to flower, because our cold nights and
frosts come so soone, before it can haue comfort enough of the Sun to
ripen it.


4. _Convolvulus cæruleus minor Hispanicus._
The Spanish small blew Bindeweede.

This small Bindeweede hath small long leaues, somewhat broader then the
next that followeth, and not so broad as the common small Bindeweede
(that groweth euery where wilde on the bankes of fields abroad) set
vpon the small trayling branches, which growe aboue two or three foote
high: from the middle of these branches, and so vnto the toppes of
them, come forth the flowers at the ioynts with the leaues, folded
together at the first into fiue plaites, which open into so many
corners, of a most excellent faire skie coloured blew (so pleasant to
behold, that often it amazeth the spectator) with white bottomes, and
yellowish in the middle, which turne into small round white heads,
wherein are contained small blackish cornered seede, somewhat like the
former, but smaller: the roote is small and threddy, perishing as the
former euery yeare: this neuer windeth it selfe about any thing, but
leaneth by reason of the weaknesse of the branches, and dyeth euery
yeare after seede time, and not to be sowne againe vntill the next
Spring.


5. _Convolvulus purpureus Spicæfolius._   Lauander leafed Bindeweede.

This small purple Bindeweede, where it naturally groweth, is rather a
plague then a pleasure, to whatsoeuer groweth with it in the fields;
yet the beauty of the flower hath caused it to be receiued into
Gardens, bearing longer and smaller leaues then the last, and such like
small Bell-flowers, but of a sad purple colour: the roote is liuing,
as the common kinds are, and springeth againe where it hath been once
sowne, without feare of perishing.


        The Place.

        The first two greater kindes haue beene sent vs out of Italy,
        but whether they had them from the East Indies, or from some
        of the Easterne Countries on this side, wee know not: but
        they thriue reasonable well in our Country, if the yeare be
        any thing kindly. The next came out of America, as his name
        testifieth. The lesser blew kinde groweth naturally in many
        places both of Spaine and Portugall (from whence I first
        receiued seedes from Guillaume Boel, heretofore remembred.) The
        last groweth wilde in the fields, about Dunmowe in Essex, and
        in many other places of our owne Countrey likewise.


        The Time.

        The three first greater kindes flower not vntill the end of
        August, or thereabouts, and the seede ripeneth in September,
        if the colds and frosts come not on too speedily. The lesser
        kindes flower in Iune and Iuly.


        The Names.

        The first is called of some _Campana Lazura_, as the Italians
        doe call it, or _Campana cærulea_, of others _Convolvulus
        cæruleus maior_, _siue Indicus_, and _Flos noctis_. Of some
        _Nil Auicennæ_. The second, is called _Convolvulus trifolius_,
        or _hederaceus_, for the distinction of the leaues. In English
        wee call them eyther Great blew Bell flowers, or more vsually,
        Great blew Bindeweedes. That of America is diuersly called by
        diuers. It is called _Quamoclit_ of the Indians, and by that
        name it was sent to Ioachinus Camerarius out of Italy, where
        it is so called still, as Fabius Columna setteth it downe, and
        as my selfe also can witnesse it, from thence being so sent
        vnto mee: but Andræas Cæsalpinus calleth it, _Iasminum folio
        Millefolij_, supposing it to be a Iasmine. Camerarius saith, it
        may not vnfitly be called _Convolvulus tenuifolius_, accounting
        it a kinde of Bindeweede. Columna entituleth it _Convolvulus
        pennatus exoticus rarior_, and saith it cannot bee referred
        to any other kinde of plant then to the Bindeweede. Hee that
        published the _Curæ posteriores_ of Clusius, giueth it the
        name of _Iasminum Americanum_, which I would doe also, if I
        thought it might belong to that Family; but seeing the face
        and forme of the plant better agreeing with the Bindeweedes or
        Bell-flowers, I haue (as you see) inserted it among them, and
        giuen it that name may bee most fit for it, especially because
        it is but an annuall plant. The lesser kindes haue their names
        sufficiently expressed in their titles.


        The Vertues.

        We know of no vse these haue in Physicke with vs, although
        if the first be _Nil_ of Auicen, both he and Serapio say it
        purgeth strongly.




CHAP. LXXXVIII.

_Stramonium._   Thorne-Apple.


Vnto the Bell-flowers, I must adioyne three other plants, in the three
seuerall Chapters following, for some affinity of the flowers: and
first of the Thorne-Apples, whereof there are two especiall kindes,
that is, a greater and a lesser, and of each some diuersity, as shall
be set downe.


1. _Stramonium maius album._   The great white flowred Thorne-Apple.

The greater Thorne-Apple hath a great, strong, round greene stalke, as
high as any man, if it be planted in good ground, and of the bignesse
of a mans wrest almost at the bottome, spreading out at the toppe into
many branches, whereon stand many very large and broad darke greene
leaues, cut in very deeply on the edges, and hauing manie points or
corners therein: the flowers come forth at the ioynts, betweene two
branches towards the toppe of them, being very large, long, and wide
open, ending in fiue points or corners, longer and larger then any
other Bell-flowers whatsoeuer: after the flowers are past, come the
fruit, which are thorny long heads, more prickly and greene then the
lesser kindes, which being ripe openeth it selfe into three or foure
parts, hauing a number of flat blackish seede within them: the roote is
aboundant in fibres, whereby it strongly taketh hold in the ground, but
perisheth with the first frosts; yet the seede that is shed when the
fruit is ripe, commeth vp the next yeare.


2. _Stramonium maius purpureum._
The great purple flowred Thorne-Apple.

This purple Thorne-Apple is in largenesse of leaues, thicknesse and
height of stalke, greatnesse and forme of flowers and fruit, euery
way equall and correspondent vnto the former, the chiefe differences
be these: the stalke is of a darke purple colour; the leaues are of a
darker greene, somewhat purplish, and the flowers are of light purple
or pale Doue colour, enclining to white, and whiter at the bottome.


3. _Stramonium minus seu Nux Metel flore albo._
The smaller Thorne-Apple with a white flower.

The smaller Thorne-Apple riseth vp with one round stalke, of the
bignesse of a mans finger, and neuer much aboue two foote high with vs,
bearing a few large, broad, smooth leaues thereon, without any branches
at all, which are vneuenly rent or torne about the edges, with many
ribs, and smaller veines running through them, yet lesser by much then
the greater kinde: at the ioynts where the leaues stand, come forth
long and large white flowers, with broad or wide open brims, folded
together before their opening, as the other former Bell-flowers or
Bindeweedes, but hauing their fiue corners more pointed or horned then
either they, or the former Thorne-Apples: after the flowers are past,
succeed small fruit, rounder and harder, set with harder, but blunt
prickes then the former, wherein is contained brownish yellow flat
seede, sticking to the inward pulpe; the roote is not very great, but
full of strings, and quickly perisheth with the first frosts.


[Illustration:

]


4. _Stramonium minus flore geminato purpurante._
The small double flowred purple Thorne-Apple.

In the flower of this plant, consisteth the chiefest difference from
the former, which is as large as the last, pointed into more hornes or
corners, and beareth two flowers, standing in one huske, one of them
rising out from the middle of the other, like vnto those kindes of
Cowslips and Oxelips, called double, or Hose in hose, before described,
which are of a pale purplish colour on the outside, and almost white
within: the fruit is round like the last, and beareth such like seede,
so that vntill it bee in flower, their difference can hardly bee
discerned: this is more tender then the last, although euen it is so
tender, that it seldome beareth ripe seede with vs.

[Sidenote: _Flore duplici._]

Sometimes (for I think it is not another kind) the flower will haue as
it were double rowes of leaues, close set together, and not consisting
of two, rising so distinctly one aboue another.


        The Place.

        All these kindes haue been brought or sent vs out of Turkie
        and Egypt; but Garcias, and Christopherus Acosta, with others,
        affirme that they grow in the East Indies. The lesser kindes
        are very rare with vs, because they seldome come to maturity;
        and therefore we are still to seeke of new seede to sowe. The
        greater kindes are plentifull enough in our Gardens, and will
        well abide, and giue ripe fruit.


        The Time.

        The smaller kindes flower later then the greater; and therefore
        their fruit are the sooner spoyled with the cold ayres, dewes,
        and frosts, that come at the latter end of the yeare: but the
        greater kinds neuer misse lightly to ripen.


        The Names.

        Both the greater and smaller kindes are generally called
        _Stramonium_, _Stramonia_, _Pomum spinosum_, and _Datura_.
        Bauhinus vpon Matthiolus his Comentaries on Dioscorides,
        calleth it _Solanum fætidum spinosum_. Some learned men haue
        referred it to _Nux Metel_, of the Arabian Authors. Wee call
        them generally, in English, Thorne-Apples, and distinguish them
        by their titles of greater and letter, single and double.


        The Vertues.

        The East Indian lasciuious women performe strange acts with
        the seed (of the smaller kinde, as I suppose, or it may be of
        either) giuing it their husbands to drinke. The whole plant,
        but especially the seed, is of a very cold and soporiferous
        quality, procuring sleep and distraction of senses. A few of
        the seeds steeped and giuen in drinke, will cause them that
        take it to seem starke drunke or dead drunke, which fit will
        within a few houres weare away, and they recouer their senses
        againe, as a drunken man raysed after sleep from his wine.
        It may therefore (in my opinion) be of safe and good vse to
        one, that is to haue a legge or an arme cut off, or to be cut
        for the stone, or some other such like cure to be performed,
        to take away the sense of paine for the time of doing it;
        otherwise I hold it not fit to be vsed without great caution.
        But the greene leaues of the greater kindes (as also the
        lesser, but that with vs they are not so plentifull) are by
        tryed experience, found to be excellent good for any scalded or
        burned part, as also to take away any hot inflammations, being
        made vp into a salue or ointment with suet, waxe, and rossin,
        &c. or with _Axungia_, that is, Hogs larde.




CHAP. LXXXIX.

_Tabacco._   Indian Henbane, or Tabacco.


There hath beene formerly but three kindes of Tabacco knowne vnto vs,
two of them called Indian, and the third English Tabacco. In these
later yeares, we haue had in our gardens about London (before the
suppressing of the planting) three or foure other sorts at the least,
and all of the Indian kinde, hauing some especiall difference, eyther
in leafe, or flower, or both: And in regard the flowers of some of
these carry a pretty shew, I shall only entreate of them, and not of
the English kind.


_Tabacco latifolium._   Broade leafed Tabacco.

The great Indian Tabacco hath many very large, long, thicke, fat
and faire greene leaues, standing foreright for the most part, and
compassing the stalkes at the bottome of them, being somewhat pointed
at the end: the stalke is greene and round, sixe or seuen foote high
at sometimes, and in some places, in others not past three or foure
foote high, diuided towards the toppe into many branches, with leaues
at euery ioynt, and at the toppes of the branches many flowers, the
bottomes hereof are long and hollow, and the toppes plaited or folded
before they are open, but being open, are diuided sometimes into foure,
or more vsually into fiue corners, somewhat like vnto other of the
Bell-flowers, but lying a little flatter open, of a light carnation
colour. The seede is very small and browne, contained in round heads,
that are clammy while they are greene, and pointed at the end: the
roote is great, whitish, and woody at the head, dispersing many long
branches, and small fibres vnder the ground, whereby it is strongly
fastened, but perisheth with our violent frosts in the winter, if it be
left abroad in the garden, but if it be housed, or safely prouided for
against the frostes, the rootes will liue, and spring afresh the next
yeare.

There is of this kinde another sort, whose leaues are as large and long
as the former, but thicker, and of a more dead greene colour, hanging
downe to the ground-ward, and scarce any standing forth-right, as the
former, vnlesse they bee very young: the flowers of this kinde are
almost whole, without any great shew of corners at the brims or edges,
in all other things there is no difference.

There is another, whose large and thicke flat leaues doe compasse the
stalke at the bottome, and are as it were folded together one side vnto
another: the flowers are of a deeper blush, or carnation colour, and
with longer points and corners then in any of the former; and in these
two things consisteth the difference from the others, and is called
Verines Tabacco.

Another hath his leaues not so large and long as the first, and these
haue short footestalkes, whereon they stand, and doe not compasse the
stalke as the other doe: the flower hereof is like the first, but
smaller, and of a little paler colour.


_Tabacco angustifolium._   Narrow leafed Tabacco.

This kinde of Tabacco hath somewhat lower, and smaller stalkes, then
any of the former: the leaues hereof are smaller and narrower, and not
altogether so thicke, but more pointed, and euery one standing vpon a
footstalke, an inch and a halfe long at the least: the flowers hereof
stand thicker together, vpon the small branches, somewhat larger, of a
deeper blush colour, and more eminent corners then in any the former;
the seed and roots are alike, and perish in like manner, vnlesse it
be brought into a cellar, or other such couert, to defend it from the
extremitie of the Winter.


        The Place.

        America or the West Indies is the place where all these kindes
        doe grow naturally, some in one place, and some in another, as
        in Peru, Trinidado, Hispaniola, and almost in euery Iland and
        Countrey of the continent thereof: with vs they are cherished
        in gardens, as well for the medicinable qualities, as for the
        beauty of the flowers.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in August, seldome before, and the seede is ripe
        quickly after. If it once sowe it selfe in a Garden, it will
        giue next year after young plants: but for the most part they
        will spring vp late, and therefore they that would haue them
        more early, haue sowen the seede vpon a bed of dung, and
        transplanted them afterwards.


        The Names.

        This plant hath gotten many names. The Indians call it in some
        places _Petum_, in others, _Picielt_, and _Perebecenuc_, as
        Ouiedus and others doe relate. The Spaniards in the Indies
        first called it _Tabacco_, of an Iland where plenty of it
        grew. It hath in Christendome receiued diuers other names,
        as _Nicotiana_, of one Nicot a French man, who seeing it
        in Portugall, sent it to the French Queene, from whom it
        receiued the name of _Herba Regina_. Lobel calleth it _Sancta
        herba_, & _Sanasancta Indorum_. Some haue adiudged it to be
        an _Hioscyamus_, and therefore call it _Peruvianus_. The most
        vsuall name wherby we call it in English, is Tabacco.


        The Vertues.

        The herbe is, out of question, an excellent helpe and remedy
        for diuers diseases, if it were rightly ordered and applyed,
        but the continuall abuse thereof in so many, doth almost
        abolish all good vse in any. Notwithstanding if men would apply
        their wits to the finding out of the vertues, I make no doubt
        but many strange cures would bee performed by it, both inward
        and outward. For outward application, a Salue made hereof (as
        is before recited of the Thorne apple leaues) cureth vlcers,
        and wounds of hard curation: And for inward helpes, a Syrupe
        made of the iuice and sugar, or honey, procureth a gentle
        vomit (but the dryed leafe infused in wine much more) and is
        effectuall in astmaticall diseases, if it bee carefully giuen.
        And likewise cleanseth cankers and fistulaes admirably, as hath
        beene found by late experience. The ashes of Tabacco is often
        vsed, and with good successe, for cuts in the hands, or other
        places, and for other small greene wounds.




CHAP. XC.

_Mirabilia Peruviana._   The Meruaile of Peru.


This plant yeeldeth in our Gardens fiue or sixe seuerall varieties of
beautifull flowers, as pure white, pure yellow, pure red, white and red
spotted, and red and yellow spotted. But besides these, I haue had some
other sorts, among which was one, of a pale purple or peach colour:
all which, comming vnto mee out of Spaine with many other, seedes in
an vnkindly yeare (an early winter following a cold summer) perished
with mee; yet I plainely might discerne by their leaues, and manner of
growing, to be diuers from them that we now haue and keepe. I shall
need therefore (because the chiefest difference consisteth almost in
the flowers) to giue only one description of the plant, and therein
shew the varieties as is before declared.


_Admirabilis._   The Meruaile of the World.

The stalke of this meruellous plant is great and thick, bigger then
any mans thumbe, bunched out or swelling at euery ioynt, in some the
stalkes will bee of a faire greene colour, and those will bring white,
or white and red flowers: in others they will bee reddish; and more at
the ioynts, and those giue red flowers; and in some of a darker greene
colour, which giue yellow flowers; the stalkes and ioynts of those that
will giue red and yellow flowers spotted, are somewhat brownish, but
not so red as those that giue wholly red flowers: vpon these stalkes
that spread into many branches, doe grow at the ioynts vpon seuerall
footestalkes, faire greene leaues, broad at the stalke, and pointed at
the end: at the ioynts likewise toward the vpper part of the branches,
at the foote of the leaues, come forth seuerall flowers vpon short
footestalkes, euery one being small, long and hollow from the bottome
to the brimme, which is broade spread open, and round, and consist
but of one leafe without diuision, like vnto a Bell flower, but not
cornered at all: which flowers, as I said, are of diuers colours, and
diuersly marked and spotted, some being wholly white, without any spot
in them for the most part, through all the flowers of the plant; so
likewise some being yellow, and some wholly red; some plants againe
being mixed and spotted, so variably either white and red, or purple,
(except here and there some may chance to be wholly white, or red or
purple among the rest) or red and yellow through the whole plant,
(except as before some may chance in this kinde to be eyther wholly
red, or wholly yellow) that you shall hardly finde two or three flowers
in a hundred, that will bee alike spotted and marked, without some
diuersitie, and so likewise euery day, as long as they blow, which
is vntill the winters, or rather autumnes cold blastes do stay their
willing pronenesse to flower: And I haue often also obserued, that
one side of a plant will giue fairer varieties then another, which is
most commonly the Easterne, as the more temperate and shadowie side.
All these flowers doe open for the most part, in the euening, or in
the night time, and so stand blowne open, vntill the next mornings sun
beginne to grow warme vpon them, which then close themselues together,
all the brims of the flowers shrinking into the middle of the long
necke, much like vnto the blew Bindeweede, which in a manner doth so
close vp at the sunnes warme heate: or else if the day be temperate
and milde, without much sunne shining vpon them, the flowers will not
close vp for the most part of that day, or vntill toward night: after
the flowers are past, come seuerall seedes, that is, but one at a place
as the flowers stood before, of the bignesse (sometimes) of pease, but
not so round, standing within the greene huskes, wherein the flowers
stood before, being a little flat at the toppe, like a crowne or head,
and round where it is fastened in the cup, of a blacke colour when it
is ripe, but else greene all the while it groweth on the stalke, and
being ripe is soone shaken downe with the wind, or any other light
shaking: the roote is long and round, greater at the head, and smaller
downwards to the end, like vnto a Reddish, spreading into two or three,
or more branches, blackish on the outside and whitish within. These
rootes I haue often preserued by art a winter, two or three (for they
will perish if they be left out in the garden, vnlesse it be vnder a
house side) because many times, the yeare not falling out kindely,
the plants giue not ripe seede, and so we should be to seeke both of
seede to sow, and of rootes to set, if this or the like art to keep
them, were not vsed; which is in this manner: Within a while after the
first frosts haue taken the plants, that the leaues wither and fall,
digge vp the rootes whole, and lay them in a dry place for three or
foure dayes, that the superfluous moysture on the outside, may be spent
and dryed, which done, wrap them vp seuerally in two or three browne
papers, and lay them by in a boxe, chest or tub, in some conuenient
place of the house all the winter time, where no winde or moist ayre
may come vnto them; and thus you shall haue these rootes to spring a
fresh the next yeare, if you plant them in the beginning of March, as
I haue sufficiently tryed. But some haue tryed to put them vp into a
barrell or firkin of sand, or ashes, which is also good if the sand and
ashes be thorough dry, but if it bee anything moist, or if they giue
againe in the winter, as it is vsuall, they haue found the moisture of
the rootes, or of the sand, or both, to putrefie the rootes, that they
haue beene nothing worth, when they haue taken them forth. Take this
note also for the sowing of your seede, that if you would haue variable
flowers, and not all of one colour, you must choose out such flowers
as be variable while they grow, that you may haue the seede of them:
for if the flowers bee of one entire colour, you shall haue for the
most part from those seedes, plants that will bring flowers all of that
colour, whether it be white, red or yellow.


        The Place.

        These plants grow naturally in the West Indies, where there is
        a perpetuall summer, or at the least no cold frosty winters,
        from whence the seede hath been sent into these parts of
        Europe, and are dispersed into euery garden almost of note.


        The Time.

        These plants flower from the end of Iuly sometimes, or August,
        vntill the frosts, and cold ayres of the euenings in October,
        pull them down, and in the meane time the seed is ripe.


        The Names.

        Wee haue not receiued the seedes of this plant vnder any other
        name, then _Mirabilia Peruvians_, or _Admirabilis planta_. In
        English wee call them, The meruaile of Peru, or the meruaile
        of the world: yet some Authors haue called it _Gelseminum_,
        or _Iasminum rubrum_, _&_ _Indicum_: and Bauhinus _Solanum
        Mexicanum flore magno_.


        The Vertues.

        We haue not knowne any vse hereof in Physicke.




CHAP. XCI.

_Malua._   Mallowes.


Of the kindred of Mallowes there are a great number, some of the
gardens, others wilde, some with single flowers, others with double,
some with whole leaues, others with cut or diuided: to entreate of
them all is not my purpose, nor the scope of this worke, but onely of
such whose flowers, hauing beautie and respect, are fit to furnish
this garden, as ornaments thereunto. And first of those single kindes,
whose flowers come neerest vnto the fashion of the former Bell-flowers,
and after to the double ones, which for their brauery, are entertained
euery where into euery Countrey womans garden.


1. _Malua Hispanica flore carneo amplo._   The Spanish blush Mallow.

The Spanish Mallow is in forme and manner of growing, very like vnto
our common fielde Mallow, hauing vpright stalkes two or three foote
high, spread into diuers branches, and from the bottome to the toppe,
beset with round leaues, like vnto our Mallowes, but somewhat smaller,
rounder, and lesse diuided, yet larger below then aboue: the flowers
are plentifully growing vpon the small branches, folding or writhing
their leaues one about another before they bee blowne, and being open
consist of fiue leaues, with a long forked clapper therein, of the
same colour with the flower: the chiefest difference from the common
consisteth in this, that the leaues of these flowers are longer, and
more wide open at the brimmes (almost like a Bell flower) and of a
faire blush or light carnation colour, closing at night, and opening
all the day: after the flowers are past, there come such like round
heads, with small blacke seede, like vnto the common kinde, but
somewhat smaller: the roote is small and long, and perisheth euery
yeare.

]


2. _Alcea vulgaris flore carneo._   Vervaine Mallow with blush flowers.

There is a Mallow that hath long stalkes, and flowers like vnto the
common wilde Mallow, and of the same deepe colour with it, so that
you can hardly know it from the ordinary kinde, which is found growing
wilde together with it, but onely by the leafe, which is as round and
as large as the former, but cut into many fine diuisions, euen to the
stalke that vpholdeth it, that it seemeth to consist onely of ragges,
or peeces of leaues: Of this kinde I take a plante for this garden,
growing in all respects like vnto it, but differing onely in the colour
of the flowers, which are of the same blush or light carnation colour,
or not much differing from the former Spanish kinde, with some veines
therein of a deeper colour: the root hereof liueth, as the root of the
common wilde kinde doth.


3. _Alcea peregrina siue vesicaria._
Venice Mallow, or Good night at noone.

The Venice Mallow hath long and weake stalkes, most vsually lying or
leaning vpon the ground, hauing here and there vpon them long leaues
and somewhat broad, cut in or gashed very deepely on both edges,
that it seemeth as if they were diuers leaues set together, euery
one standing on a long footestalke: at the ioynts of these stalkes,
where the leaues are set, come forth seuerall flowers, standing vpon
long footstalkes, which are somewhat larger then any of the former
flowers, consisting of fiue leaues, small at the bottome, and wide at
the brimmes, of a whitish colour tending to a blush, and sometimes all
white, with spots at the bottomes of the leaues on the inside, of a
very deepe purple or murrey colour, which addeth a great grace to the
flower, and hauing also a long pestle or clapper in the middle, as
yellow as gold: these flowers are so quickly faded and gone, that you
shall hardly see any of them blowne open, vnlesse it bee betimes in the
morning before the Sunne doe grow warme vpon them, for as soone as it
feeleth the Sunnes warme heate, it closeth vp and neuer openeth againe,
so that you shall very seldome see a flower blowne open in the day
time, after nine a clocke in the morning: after these flowers are past,
there rise vp in their places thinne, round, shining or transparent
bladders, pointed at the toppe, and ribbed down all along, wherein are
contained small, round, blackish seede: the roote is long and small,
and perisheth euery yeare.


4. _Alcea fruticosa pentaphyllea._   Cinquefoile Mallow.

The stalkes of this Mallow are very long, hard or wooddy, more then of
any of the other Mallowes: at the lower part whereof, and vp to the
middle, stand diuers leaues vpon long footestalkes, parted or diuided
into fiue parts or leaues, and dented about the edges; but vpwards from
the middle to the toppe, the leaues haue but three diuisions: among
these leaues stand large wide open flowers, of the colour of the common
Mallow: the seede is smaller then in any other Mallow, but the rootes
are great and long, spreading in the ground like vnto the rootes of
Marsh Mallowes, and springeth vp afresh euery yeare from the roote.


5. _Sabdarifa seu Alcea Americana._   Thorney Mallowe.

This Thorney Mallowe hath greene leaues next vnto the ground, that
are almost round, but pointed at the end, and dented very much about
the edges; the other leaues that growe vpon the stalke are diuided
into three parts, like vnto a trefoile, and some of them into fiue
diuisions, all of them dented about the edges: the stalke is reddish,
with some harmelesse prickles in sundry places thereon, and riseth vp
three or foure foote high in a good ground, a fit place, and a kindly
yeare, bearing plenty of flowers vpon the stalkes, one at the foote
of euery leafe, the toppe it selfe ending in a long spike, as it were
of buddes and leaues together: the flowers are of a very pale yellow,
tending to a white colour, spotted in the bottome of each of the fiue
leaues, with a deepe purple spot, broad at the lower part, and ending
in a point about the middle of the leafe, which are quickly fading, and
not abiding aboue one day, with a long pestle in the middle diuided at
the toppe: after the flower is past, commeth vp a short prickly podde,
set within a small greene huske or cup that bore the flower, wherein is
contained whitish, or rather brownish yellow seede, flat and somewhat
round, like vnto the seedes of Hollyhocke: the roote is stringie, and
quickly perisheth; for it will hardly endure in our cold Country to
giue flowers, much lesse seede, vnlesse (as I said before) it happen in
a kindly yeare, and be well planted and tended.


6. _Bamia seu Alcea Ægyptia._   The Mallow of Egypt.

This Mallow is also as tender to nourse vp as the last, hauing the
lower leaues broad like a Marsh Mallow, and of a fresh greene colour;
but those that growe vpon the stalke, and vp to the toppe, are diuided
into fiue parts or points, but are not cut in to the middle ribbe, like
the former Thorney Mallow, yet dented about the edges like vnto them:
the flowers growe at the setting to of the leaues, like vnto a Mallow
for forme, but of a whitish colour; after which come long fiue square
pointed pods, with hard shels, wherein are contained round blackish
gray seede, as bigge as a Vetch or bigger: the roote perisheth quickly
with vs, euen with the first frosts.


7. _Althæa frutex flore albo vel purpureo._
Shrubbe Mallow with a white or purple flower.

There are diuers sorts of shrubbe Mallowes, whereof some that haue
their stemmes or stalkes lesse wooddy, dye downe to the ground euery
yeare, and others that abide alwayes, are more wooddy: Of the former
sorts I intend not to speake, referring them to a fitter place; and
of the other, I will onely giue you the knowledge of one or two in
this place, although I doe acknowledge their fitted place had been to
be among the shrubbes; but because they are Mallowes, I pray let them
passe with the rest of their kindred, and their descriptions in this
manner: These wooddy kindes of shrub Mallowes haue somewhat large,
long, and diuided leaues, of a whitish greene colour, soft also, and
as it were woolly in handling, set dispersedly on the whitish hard or
wooddy stalkes: their flowers are large, like vnto a single Rose or
Hollyhocke, in the one being white with purple spots in the bottome;
in the other either of a deepe red colour, or else of a paler purple,
with a deeper bottome, and with veines running in euery leafe: they
are somewhat tender, and would not be suffered to be vncouered in the
Winter time, or yet abroad in the Garden, but kept in a large pot or
tubbe, in the house or in a warme cellar, if you would haue them to
thriue.


8. _Malua hortensis rosea simplex & multiplex diuersorum colorum._
Hollihockes single and double of seuerall colours.

I shall not neede to make many descriptions of Hollihockes, in regard
the greatest difference consisteth in the flowers, which are in some
single, in some double, in some of one colour, and in others of other
colours: for the lowest leaues of Hollihockes are all round, and
somewhat large, with many corners, but not cut in or diuided, soft in
handling; but those that growe vp higher are much more diuided into
many corners: the stalkes sometimes growe like a tree, at the least
higher then any man, with diuers such diuided leaues on them, and
flowers from the middle to the toppe, where they stand as it were a
long spike of leaues and buds for flowers together: the flowers are
of diuers colours, both single and double, as pure white, and pale
blush, almost like a white, and more blush, fresh and liuely, of a Rose
colour, Scarlet, and a deeper red like a crimson, and of a darke red
like blacke bloud; these are the most especiall colours both of single
and double flowers that I haue seene: the single flowers consist of
fiue broad and round leaues, standing round like vnto single Roses,
with a middle long stile, and some chiues aboue them: the double
flowers are like vnto double Roses, very thicke, so that no stile or
vmbone is seene in the middle, and the outermost rowe of leaues in
the flowers are largest, the innermost being smaller and thicke set
together: after the flowers are past, there come vp as well in the
double as single, flat round heads, like flat cakes, round about the
bottomes whereof growe flat whitish seede: the roote is long and great
at the head, white and tough, like the roote of the common Mallowes,
but greater, and will reasonably well abide the Winter.


        The Place.

        The first groweth wilde in Spaine. The second in our owne
        Countrey. The third is thought to growe in Italy and Venice;
        but Lobel denieth it, saying, that it is there onely in
        Gardens, and is more plentifull in these parts then with them.
        The fourth Clusius saith he found in many places of Germany.
        The fifth is supposed to be first brought out of the West
        Indies, but an Arabicke name being giuen it, maketh me somewhat
        doubtfull how to beleeue it. The sixth groweth in Egypt, where
        it is of great vse, as Prosper Alpinus hath let downe in his
        Booke of Egyptian plants. The seuenth groweth in some parts
        both of Spaine and France. The last is not found but in Gardens
        euery where.


        The Time.

        The first, second, third, fourth, and last, doe flower from
        Iune vntill the end of Iuly and August. The rest flower very
        late, many times not vntill September or October.


        The Names.

        The first and second haue their names sufficiently expressed in
        their titles. The third is diuersly called, as _Malua horaria_,
        _Alcea versicaria_, _Alcea Veneta_, _Alcea Peregrina_, and of
        Matthiolus, _Hypecoum_. The most vsuall English name is Venice
        Mallow. The fourth is called _Alcea fruticosa pentaphyllea_,
        and _Cannabinifolio_, or _Pentaphyllifolio_: In English,
        Cinquefoile Mallow. The fifth hath been sent vnder the name of
        _Sabdarifa_, and _Sabdariffa_, and (as I said) is thought to be
        brought from America, and therefore it beareth the name of that
        Country. The sixth is called in Egypt, _Bamia_, or _Bammia_,
        and by that name sent with the addition _del Cayro_ vnto it:
        In English, Egyptian Mallow, or Mallow of Egypt. The seuenth
        is called _Althæa frutex_, and of some _Althæa arborea_: In
        English, Shrubbe Mallow, because his stemme is wooddie, and
        abideth as shrubbes and trees doe. The eight and last is called
        _Malua hortensis_, _Malua Rosea_, and of some _Rosa vltra
        marina_: In English, of some Hockes, and vsually Hollihockes.


        The Vertues.

        All sorts of Mallowes, by reason of their viscous or slimie
        quality, doe helpe to make the body soluble, being vsed
        inwardly, and thereby helpe also to ease the paines of the
        stone and grauell, causing them to be the more easily voided:
        being outwardly applyed, they mollifie hard tumours, and helpe
        to ease paines in diuers parts of the body; yet those that
        are of most vse, are most common. The rest are but taken vpon
        credit.




CHAP. XCII.

_Amaranthus._   Flower-gentle.


We haue foure or fiue sorts of Flower-gentle to trimme vp this our
Garden withall, which doe differ very notably one from another, as
shall be declared in their seuerall descriptions; some of which are
very tender, and must be carefully regarded, and all little enough to
cause them beare seede with vs, or else wee shall bee to seeke euery
yeare: others are hardy enough, and will hardly be lost out of the
Garden.


1. _Amaranthus purpureus minor._   The small purple Flower-gentle.

This gallant purple Veluet flower, or Flower-gentle, hath a crested
stalke two foote high or more, purplish at the bottome, but greene to
the toppe, whereout groweth many small branches, the leaues on the
stalkes and branches are somewhat broad at the bottome, and sharpe
pointed, of a full greene colour, and often somewhat reddish withall,
like in forme vnto the leaues of Blites (whereof this and the rest are
accounted _species_, or sorts) or small Beetes: the flowers are long,
spikie, soft, and gentle tufts of haires, many as it were growing
together, broad at the bottome, and small vp at the toppe, pyramis or
steeple-fashion, of so excellent a shining deepe purple colour, tending
to a murrey, that in the most excellent coloured Veluet, cannot be
seene a more orient colour, (and I thinke from this respect, the French
call it _Passe velours_, that is to say, passing Veluet in colour)
without any smell at all, which being bruised giueth the same excellent
purple colour on paper, and being gathered in his full strength and
beauty, will abide a great time (if it be kept out of the winde and
sunne in a dry place) in the same grace and colour: among these tufts
lye the seede scattered, which is small, very blacke, and shining: the
rootes are a few threddy strings, which quickly perish, as the whole
plant doth, at the first approach of Winter weather.


2. _Amaranthus Coccineus._   Scarlet Flower-gentle.

The leaues of this Flower-gentle are longer, and somewhat narrower then
the former; the stalke groweth somewhat higher, bearing his long tufts
at seuerall leaues, as also at the toppe of the stalkes, many being set
together, but separate one from another, and each bowing or bending
downe his head, like vnto a Feather, such as is worn in our Gallants
and Gentlewomens heads, of an excellent bloudy Scarlet colour: the
seede is blacke, like vnto the former: the roote perisheth quicklier,
because it is more tender.


3. _Amaranthus tricolor._   Spotted or variable Flower-gentle.

The chiefest beauty of this plant consisteth in the leaues, and not in
the flowers; for they are small tufts growing along the stalke, which
is nothing so high as the former, especially with vs, and at the ioynts
with the leaues: the leaues hereof are of the same fashion that the
former are, and pointed also; but euery leafe is to be seene parted
into greene, red, and yellow, very orient and fresh (especially if it
come to his full perfection, which is in hot and dry weather) diuided
not all alike, but in some leaues, where the red or yellow is, there
will be greene, and so varying, that it is very pleasant to behold: the
seede hereof is blacke and shining, not to bee knowne from the former.


4. _Amaranthus Carnea spica._   Carnation Flower-gentle.

There is another more rare then all the rest, whose leaues are somewhat
longer, and narrower then the first, and like vnto the second kinde:
the spikes are short, many set together, like branches full of heads or
eares of corne, euery one whereof hath some long haires sticking out
from them, of a deep blush, tending to a carnation colour.


5. _Amaranthus purpureus maior paniculis sparsis._
Great Floramour, or purple Flower-gentle.

The great Floramour hath one thicke, tall, crested, browne red stalke,
fiue or six foote high, from whence spring many great broad leaues,
like vnto the former for the forme, but much larger & redder for the
most part, especially the lowest, which brancheth forth into diuers
parts, & from between these leaues, & the stalks or branches, as also
at the tops of them, stand long, spikie, round, & somewhat flat tufts,
of a more reddish purple colour then the first, and diuided also into
seuerall parts, wherin when they are full ripe, are to be seen an
innumerable company of white seed, standing out among the short thrums,
and do then easily fall away with a little touching; euery one of these
white seed hath as it were an hole halfe bored through therin: the root
is a great bush of strings, spreading in the ground, whereby it is
strongly fastened, yet perisheth euery yeare, after it hath giuen his
seede.


        The Place.

        All these plants growe in the Easterne Countries, as Persia,
        Syria, Arabia, &c. except the greatest, which hath been brought
        out of the West Indies, where it is much vsed, especially the
        seede: they are all, noursed vp with much care in our Gardens,
        and yet in a backward or cold yeare they will not thriue, for
        that they desire much heate: but the greatest doth alwayes giue
        ripe seede euery yeare.


        The Time.

        They beare their gallant tufts or spikes for the most part in
        August, and some not vntill September.


        The Names.

        The name _Amaranthus_ is giuen to all these plants, taken
        from the Greeke word ἀμαραντίνος, _non marcescens_, or _non
        senescens_, that is, neuer waxing old, and is often also
        imposed on other plants, who haue the same property, that
        is, that their flowers being gathered in a fit season, will
        retaine their natiue colour a long time, as shall be shewed
        in the Chapter following. Diuers do thinke the first to be
        _Phlox_, or _Flamma_ of Theophrastus. The third is called
        _Gelosia_, or _Celosia_ of Tragus. Spigelius in his _Isagoges_
        saith, it is generally taken to be _Sophonia_, whereof Plinie
        maketh mention; and Lobel, to bee the Persians _Theombroton_
        of Plinie. The Italians, from whom I had it (by the meanes of
        Mʳ. Doctor Iohn More, as I haue had many other rare simples)
        call it, _Blito di tre colori_, A three coloured Blite. The
        fifth, which is the greatest, hath been sent from the West
        Indies by the name of _Quinüa_, as Clusius reporteth. The name
        Flower-gentle in English, and _Floramour_, which is the French,
        of _Flos amoris_, and _Passe velours_, as is before said,
        or Veluet flower, according to the Italian, _Flor veluto_,
        are equally giuen to all these plants, with their seuerall
        distinctions, as they are expressed in their titles.


        The Vertues.

        Diuers suppose the flowers of these plants doe helpe to stay
        the fluxe of bloud in man or woman, because that other things
        that are red or purple doe performe the same. But Galen
        disproueth that opinion very notably, _in lib. 2. & 4. de
        simpl. medicament. facultatibus_.




CHAP. XCIII.

_Helichrysum, siue Amaranthus luteus._
Golden Flower-gentle, Goldilockes, or Gold-flower.


The propinquity of property (as I before said) hath caused the affinity
in name, and so in neighbourhood in these plants, wherein there are
some diuersity; and although they differ from them before in many
notable points, yet they all agree with themselues in the golden, or
siluer heads or tufts they beare; and therefore I haue comprised them
in one Chapter, and will begin with that which commeth nearest vnto the
_Helichrysum_ of Dioscorides, or _Aurelia_ (as Gaza translateth it) of
Theophrastus.


[Illustration:

   1 _Amaranthus purpureus maior._ The great purple Flower gentle.

  10 _Gnaphalium roseum._ The Cotton Rose.
]


1. _Helichrysum._   The Golden flower of life.

This first Golden tuft riseth vp with many hard, round, white stalkes,
a foote and a halfe high, whereon at certaine distances stand many
fine cut leaues, or rather one leafe cut into many small fine parts,
almost as small as Fenell, but grayish, like vnto the Cud-weedes or
Cotton-weedes (whereof certainly these are speciall kindes) at the
toppes of the stalkes stand many round flowers, of a pale gold colour,
in an vmbell close together, yet euery flower vpon his owne stalke, and
all of an euen height, which will keepe the colour, being gathered,
and kept dry for a long time after, and are of a hot and quicke sent:
the roote is small and wooddy, spreading vnder the vpper crust of the
earth, and liueth long in his owne naturall place, but very hardly
endureth the cold of our Winters, vnlesse they be milde, or it be well
defended.


2. _Helichrysum Creticum._   Candy Goldilockes.

Candy Goldilockes hath two or three small slender white branches, set
here and there very scatteringly, with small, long, and narrow hoary
leaues, hauing yellow heads of flowers at the tops made into vmbels
or tufts, not so round and euen as the former, but longwise one aboue
another, the heads being made as it were of scales, loosly, and not so
closely set together, as in the next following, which when they are
full ripe, doe passe into doune, and are blowne away with the winde,
hauing a small reddish seede at the end; but will abide a long time, as
the other in his beauty, being gathered in time, as the rest will doe.


3. _Helichrysum Orientale siue Amaranthus luteus._
Golden Flower-gentle.

This most beautifull plant is very like vnto the former Candy
Goldilockes last described, but growing vp higher, with many more
branches, and more hoary, white, and woolly, hauing also long and
narrow white leaues, but somewhat broader, and thicker set on the
branches: the tufts of flowers or vmbels likewise doe consist of
longer and larger heads, more scaly, and closer compact together, of
an excellent pale gold yellow colour, and shining, with some yellow
threads or thrummes in the middle: the roote dyeth not euery yeare, but
liueth long, especially in the South and East Countries, where no colds
or frosts are felt; but will require extraordinary care and keeping,
and yet scarce sufficient to preserue it in these cold Countries.


4. _Chrysocome siue Stæchas Citrina._
Golden tufts or Golden Cassidony.

This Golden flower is somewhat like the former of these two last
described, hauing hoary stalkes and leaues, standing confusedly on
them, being long, and narrower then any of the former: the tops of the
stalkes are diuided into many parts, each bearing a small long yellow
head or flower at the toppe, with some yellow thrummes in them, which
heads being many, are diffusedly set together, like a loose or sparsed
vmbell, keeping their colour long before they wither, and when they
are ripe, haue thinne small reddish seede, like Mariorome seede, but
smaller; the roote is small and blacke: the whole plant, as well leaues
and flowers, as rootes, are of a strong sharpe sent, yet pleasant.


5. _Argyrocome siue Gnaphalium Americanum._
Liue long or Life euerlasting.

This siluer tuft or Indian Cotton weede, hath many white heads of
leafes at their first springing out of the ground, couered with a hoary
woollinesse like cotton, which rising into hard, thicke round stalkes,
containe still the same hoarinesse vpon them, as also vpon the long and
narrow leaues which are set thereon, especially on the vnder side, for
the vpper sides are of a darke shining greene colour: the stalkes are
diuided at the toppe into many small branches, each whereof haue many
scaly tufted heads set together, couered ouer with cotton before their
opening, and then diffeuering one from another, abiding very white on
the outside, when they are fully growne, but with a small yellow thrume
in the midde of euery flower, which in time turne into yellow doune,
apt to be blowne away with euery winde: the roots are long and black on
the outside, creeping vnder ground very much.


6. _Gnaphalium montanum flore albo & flore purpureo._
White and purple Cats foote.

This small Cudweede or Cottonweede, hath many small white woolly leaues
growing from the roote, which is composed of a few small blackish
threds, and lying vpon the ground somewhat like vnto the leaues of
a small Mouse eare, but smaller; from among which riseth vp a small
stalke of halfe a foote high or thereabouts, beset here and there with
some few leaues, at the top whereof commeth forth a tuft of small
flowers, set close together, in some of a pure white, in others of a
purple or reddish colour, in some of a pale red or blush, and in others
of a white and purple mixt together, which for the beauty is much
commended and desired, but will hardly abide to be kept in Gardens, so
vnwilling they are to leaue their naturall abiding.


7. _Gnaphalium Roseum._   The Cotton Rose.

This little rose Cotton weede hath many such like woolly leaues,
growing as the former from the roote vpon small short branches, not
full an hand breadth high, in fashion somewhat like vnto Daysie leaues,
but lesser, and round pointed: at the toppe of euery stalke or branch,
standeth one flower, composed of two rowes of small white leaues, layd
open like a Starre or a Rose, as it beareth the name, hauing a round
head in the middle made of many yellow threds or thrumes, which falling
away, there riseth vp a small round head, full of small seedes: the
root is small, long and threddy.


        The Place.

        The foure first plants doe grow naturally in many of the hot
        Countries of Europe, as Spaine, Italie, and Prouince in France;
        as also in Candy, Barbary, and other places, and must be
        carefully kept with vs in the winter time. The Liue long was
        brought out of the West Indies, and groweth plentifully in our
        gardens. The two last doe grow as well in the colder Countries
        of Germany, as in France and other places.


        The Time.

        They all flower in the end of September, if they will shew out
        their beauty at all with vs, for sometimes it is so late, that
        they haue no faire colour at all, especially the foure first
        sorts.


        The Names.

        Variable and many are the names that seuerall Writers do
        call these foure first sorts of plants, as _Helichrysum_,
        _Heliochrysum_, or _Elichrysum_, _Eliochrysum_, _Chrysocome_,
        _Coma aurea_, _Amaranthus luteus_, _Stoechas Citrina_, and
        _Aurelia_, with others, needlesse here to be recited: it is
        sufficient for this worke, to giue you knowledge that their
        names are sufficient as they are expressed in their titles:
        The fift is called _Gnaphalium_ by Carolus Clusius, from the
        likenesse of the vmbels or tufts of heads, though greater and
        white: for as I said before, the Cotton weedes are of kindred
        with the golden tufts: It hath been called by our English
        Gentlewomen, Liue long, and Life euerlasting, because of the
        durabilitie of the flowers in their beautie. The two last are
        called _Gnaphalium_, according to their titles; and in English
        they may passe vnder those names are set downe with them.


        The Vertues.

        The foure first are accounted to bee hot and dry, and the three
        last to bee cold and dry: yet all of them may to some good
        purpose bee applyed to rheumaticke heads. The former foure are
        likewise vsed to cause vrine, and in baths to comfort and heate
        cold parts. They are also layd in chests and wardrobes, to
        keepe garments from moths; and are worne in the heads and armes
        of Gentiles and others, for their beautifull aspect.




CHAP. XCIIII.

_Canna Indica._   The Indian flowring Reede.


There are two kindes or sorts of this beautifull plant, the one with a
red flower, the other with a yellow, spotted with reddish spots, both
which in some kindly yeares haue borne their braue flowers, but neuer
any ripe seede, and doth not abide the extremities of our winters,
eyther abroade or vnder couert, vnlesse it meete with a stoue or
hot-house, such as are vsed in Germany, or such other like place: For
neyther house nor cellar will preserue it, for want of heate.


_Canna Indica flore rubro._   Red flowred Indian Reede.

This beautifull plant riseth vp with faire greene, large, broade
leaues, euery one rising out of the middle of the other, and are folded
together, or writhed like vnto a paper Coffin (as they call it) such as
Comfitmakers and Grocers vse, to put in their Comfits and Spices, and
being spread open, another riseth from the bottome thereof, folded in
the same manner, which are set at the ioynts of the stalke when it is
risen vp, like vnto our water Reede, and growing (if it runne vp for
flower) to be three or foure foote high, as I haue obserued in mine
owne garden: the flowers grow at the toppe of the stalke one aboue
another, which before their opening are long, small, round, and pointed
at the end, very like vnto the claw of a Crauise or Sea-Crab, and of
the same red or crimson colour, but being open, are very like vnto the
flower of _Gladiolus_ or Corne-flagge, but of a more orient colour
then at the first, and standing in a rough huske, wherein afterwards
standeth a three square head, containing therein round blacke seede, of
the bignesse of a pease: the roote is white and tuberous, growing into
many knobs, from whence arise such other leaues and stalkes, whereby it
encreaseth very much, if it be rightly kept and defended.


_Canna Indica flore flauo punctato._   Yellow spotted Indian Reede.

This Reede groweth vp with leaues and flowers, in all points so like
vnto the former, that it cannot bee knowne from it, vntill it come
to flower, which is of a yellow colour, spotted with reddish spots,
without any other difference.


        The Place.

        These plants grow naturally in the West Indies, from whence
        they were first sent into Spaine, and Portugall, where Clusius
        saith he saw them planted by the houses sides, flowring in
        winter, which might be in those warme Countreyes. We preserue
        them with great care in our gardens, for the beautifull aspect
        of their flowers.


        The Time.

        They flower not with vs vntill the end, or middle of August, at
        the soonest.


        The Names.

        They are called of some _Canna Indica_, and _Arundo Indica_,
        of others _Cannacorus_, and of some _Flos Cancri_, because the
        colour of the flowers, as well as the forme of the buds, are so
        like vnto a Sea-Crabs cle, or claw.


        The Vertues.

        There is not any vse of these in Physicke that I know.




CHAP. XCV.

_Mandragoras._   Mandrake.


The Mandrake is distinguished into two kindes, the male and the female;
the male hath two sorts, the one differing from the other, as shall be
shewed; but of the female I know but one: The male is frequent in many
gardens, but the female, in that it is more tender and rare, is noursed
vp but in a few.


_Mandragoras mas._   The male Mandrake.

The male Mandrake thrusteth vp many leaues together out of the ground,
which being full growne, are faire, large and greene lying round about
the roote, and are larger and longer then the greatest leaues of any
Lettice, whereunto it is likened by Dioscorides and others: from the
middle, among these leaues, rise vp many flowers, euery one vpon a
long slender stalke, standing in a whitish greene huske, consisting of
fiue pretty large round pointed leaues, of a greenish white colour,
which turne into small round apples, greene at the first, and of a
pale red colour when they are ripe, very smooth and shining on the
outside, and of a heady or strong stuffing smell, wherein is contained
round whitish flat seede: the roote is long and thicke, blackish on
the outside, and white within, consisting many times but of one long
roote, and sometimes diuided into two branches a little below the
head, and sometimes into three or more, as nature listeth to bestow
vpon it, as my selfe haue often seene, by the transplanting of many,
as also by breaking and cutting off of many parts of the rootes, but
neuer found harme by so doing, as many idle tales haue beene set downe
in writing, and deliuered also by report, of much danger to happen to
such, as should digge them vp or breake them; neyther haue I euer seene
any forme of man like or woman-like parts, in the rootes of any: but
as I said, it hath oftentimes two maine rootes running down right into
the ground, and sometimes three, and sometimes but one, as it likewise
often happeneth to Parsneps, Carrots, or the like. But many cunning
counterfeit rootes haue bin shaped to such formes, and publickly
exposed to the view of all that would see them, and haue been tolerated
by the chiefe Magistrates of the Citie, notwithstanding that they haue
beene informed that such practices were meere deceit, and vnsufferable;
whether this happened through their ouer-credulitie of the thing, or
of the persons, or through an opinion that the information of the
truth rose vpon enuy, I know not, I leaue that to the searcher of all
hearts: But this you may bee bold to rest vpon, and assure your selues,
that such formes as haue bin publickly exposed to be seene, were neuer
so formed by nature, but only by the art and cunning of knaues and
deceiuers, and let this be your _Galeatum_ against all such vaine, idle
and ridiculous toyes of mens inuentions.

There is likewise another sort of these male Mandrakes, which I
first saw at Canterbury; with my very louing and kinde friende Iohn
Tradescante, in the garden of the Lord Wotton, whose gardiner he was
at that time; the leaues whereof were of a more grayish greene colour,
and somewhat folded together, when as the former kind that grew hard by
it, was of the same forme that is before described, and ordinary in all
others: but whether the apples were differing from the other, I know
not, nor did they remember that euer it had borne any.


_Mandragoras fæmina._   The female Mandrake.

The female Mandrake doth likewise put vp many leaues together, from
the head of the roote, but they are nothing so large, and are of a
darker greene colour, narrower also and shining, more crumpled, and of
a stronger sent: the flowers are many, rising vp in the middle of the
leaues, vpon slender stalkes, as in the male kind, but of a blewish
purple colour, which turne into small round fruite or apples, and not
long like a peare (as Clusius reporteth that saw them naturally growing
in Spaine) greene at the first, and of a pale yellowish colour, when
they are full ripe; of a more pleasing, or if you will, of a lesse
heady sent then the apples of the male, wherein is contained such like
seede, but smaller and blacker: the rootes are like the former, blacke
without and white within, and diuided in the same manner as the male
is, sometimes with more, and sometimes with fewer parts or branches.


        The Place.

        They grow in many places of Italie, as Matthiolus reporteth,
        but especially on Mount Garganus in Apulia. Clusius saith hee
        found the female in many wet grounds of Spaine, as also in the
        borders of those medowes that lye neere vnto riuers and water
        courses. The male is cherished in many Gardens, for pleasure as
        well as for vse; but the female as is said, is both very rare,
        and farre more tender.


        The Time.

        The Male flowreth in March, and the fruit is ripe in Iuly. The
        Female, if it be well preserued, flowreth not vntill August, or
        September; so that without extraordinary care, we neuer see the
        fruite thereof in our gardens.


        The Names.

        _Mandragoras mas_ is called _albus_, as the _Fæmina_ is called
        _niger_, which titles of blacke and white, are referred
        vnto the colour of the leaues: the female is called also
        _Thridacias_, from the likenesse of Lettice, whereunto they
        say in forme it doth carry some similitude. Dioscorides saith,
        that in his time the male was called _Morion_, and both of them
        _Antimelum_, and _Circæa_. Wee call them in English, The male,
        and the female Mandrake.


        The Vertues.

        The leaues haue a cooling and drying qualitie, fit for the
        oyntment _Populeon_, wherein it is put. But the Apples haue
        a soporiferous propertie, as Leuinus Lemnius maketh mention
        in his Herball to the Bible, of an experiment of his owne.
        Besides, as Dioscorides first, and then Serapio, Auicen, Paulus
        Ægineta, and others also do declare, they conduce much to the
        cooling and cleansing of an hot _matrix_. And it is probable,
        that Rachel knowing that they might be profitable for her hot
        and dry body, was the more earnest with Leah for her Sonne
        Rubens Apples, as it is set downe _Genesis 30. verse 14_. The
        strong sent of these apples is remembred also, _Cant. 7. 13._
        although some would diuert the signification of the Hebrew
        word, דודאים, vnto Violets, or some other sweet flowers, in
        the former place of _Genesis_, and the fruit of _Musa_, or
        Adams Apples in this place of the _Canticles_. Hamilcar the
        Carthaginian Captaine is said to haue infected the wine of the
        Lybians (his enemies against whom he fought) with the apples
        of Mandrake, whereby they being made exceeding drowsie, he
        obtained a famous victory ouer them.




CHAP. XCVI.

_Pomum Amoris._   Loue Apples.


Although the beautie of this plant consisteth not in the flower, but
fruit, yet giue me leaue to insert it here, lest otherwise it haue no
place: whereof there are two especiall sorts, which wee comprehend in
one Chapter, and distinguish them by _maius_ and _minus_, greater and
smaller: yet of the greater kinde, we haue noursed vp in our Gardens
two sorts, that differ only in the colour of the fruite, and in nothing
else.


_Pomum Amoris maius fructu rubro._
Great Apple of Loue the ordinary red sort.

This greater kinde of Loue Apples, which hath beene most frequently
cherished with vs, hath diuers long and trayling branches, leaning or
spreading vpon the ground, not able to sustaine themselues, whereon doe
grow many long winged leaues, that is, many leaues set on both sides,
and all along a middle ribbe, some being greater, and others lesse,
iagged also and dented about the edges, of a grayish ouer-worne greene
colour, somewhat rough or hairy in handling; from among the leaues and
the branches come forth long stalkes, with diuers flowers set thereon,
vpon seuerall short footstalks, consisting of sixe, and sometimes of
eight small long yellow leaues, with a middle pricke or vmbone, which
after the flowers are fallen, riseth to be the fruite, which are of the
bignesse of a small or meane Pippin, vneuenly bunched out in diuers
places, and scarce any full round without bunches, of a faire pale
reddish colour, or somewhat deeper, like vnto an Orenge, full of a
slimie iuice and watery pulpe, wherein the seede lyeth, which is white,
flat and somewhat rough: the roote shooteth with many small strings and
bigger branches vnder ground, but perisheth at the first feeling of
our winter weather. The fruite hereof by often sowing it in our Land,
is become much smaller then I haue here described it: but was at the
first, and so for two or three yeares after, as bigge as I haue related
it.


_Pomum Amoris maius fructu luteo._   Yellow Amorous Apples.

Of the same kinde is this other sort of Amorous Apples, differing in
nothing but the colour of the fruite, which is of a pale yellow colour,
hauing bunches or lobes in the same manner, and seede also like the
former.


_Pomum Amoris minus, siue Mala Ethiopica parua._   Small Loue Apples.

The small Apples of Loue in the very like manner, haue long weake
trayling branches, beset with such like leaues as the greater kinde
hath, but smaller in euery part: the flowers also stand many together
on a long stalke, and yellow as the former, but much smaller: the
fruite are small, round, yellowish red berries, not much bigger
then great grapes, wherein are contained white flat seede, like the
other, but smaller: the roote perisheth in like manner euery yeare,
and therefore must bee new sowen euery spring, if you will haue the
pleasure of their sight in the garden; yet some yeares I haue known
them rise of their owne sowing in my garden.


        The Place.

        They growe naturally in the hot Countries of Barbary, and
        Ethiopia; yet some report them to be first brought from Peru, a
        Prouince of the West Indies. Wee onely haue them for curiosity
        in our Gardens, and for the amorous aspect or beauty of the
        fruit.


        The Time.

        They flower in Iuly and August, and their fruit is ripe in the
        middle or end of September for the most part.


        The Names.

        The first is named diuersly by diuers Authors; for Lobel,
        Camerarius, and others, call them _Poma amoris_. Dodonæus
        _Aurea Mala_. Gesnerus first, and Bauhinus after him, make it
        to be a kinde of _Solanum Pomiferum_. Anguillara taketh it to
        be _Lycopersicum_ of Galen. Others thinke it to bee _Glaucium_
        of Dioscorides. The last is called _Mala Æthiopica parua_, and
        by that title was first sent vnto vs, as if the former were of
        the same kinde and country. We call them in English, Apples of
        Loue, Loue-Apples, Golden Apples, or Amorous Apples, and all as
        much to one purpose as another, more then for their beautifull
        aspect.


        The Vertues.

        In the hot Countries where they naturally growe, they are much
        eaten of the people, to coole and quench the heate and thirst
        of their hot stomaches. The Apples also boyled, or infused in
        oyle in the sunne, is thought to be good to cure the itch,
        assuredly it will allay the heate thereof.




CHAP. XCVII.

_Digitalis._   Foxegloue.


There are three principall sorts of Foxegloues, a greater, a middle or
meane sort, and a lesser, and of them, three especiall colours, that
is, purple, white, and yellow; the common purple kinde that groweth
abroad in the fields, I leaue to his wilde habitation: and of the rest
as followeth.


1. _Digitalis maxima ferruginea._   Dun coloured Foxegloues.

The leaues of this Foxegloue are long and large, of a grayish green
colour, finely cut or dented about the edges, like the teeth of a fine
sawe; among which commeth vp a strong tall stalke, which when it was
full growne, and with ripe seede thereon, I haue measured to be seuen
foot high at the least, whereon grow an innumerable company (as I may
so say, in respect of the aboundance) of flowers, nothing so large as
the common purple kinde, that groweth wilde euery where in our owne
Countrey, and of a kinde of browne or yellowish dunne colour, with a
long lippe at euery flower; after them come seede, like the common
kinde, but in smaller heads: the rootes are stringie like the ordinary,
but doe vsually perish, or seldome abide after it hath giuen seed.


[Illustration:

   1 _Canna Indica._ The Indian Reed.
   2 _Mandragoras mas._ The male Mandrake.
   3 _Pomum amoris maius._ Great Apples of loue.
   4 _Digitalis maior flore luteo amplo._ The great yellow Foxegloue.
   5 _Digitalis media flore luteo rubente._ Orenge tawny Foxegloues.
   6 _Digitalis maxima ferruginea._ Dun coloured Foxegloues.
]


2. _Digitalis maior flore carneo._   Blush coloured Foxegloues.

This kinde of Foxegloues hath reasonable large leaues, yet not
altogether so large as the common field kinde: the flowers are also
smaller then the common sort, but of a blush colour.


3. _Digitalis media flore luteo rubente._   Orenge tawnie Foxegloue.

As this Foxegloue is none of the greatest, so also is it none of the
smallest; but a sort betweene both, hauing leaues in some proportion
correspondent to the lesser yellow Foxegloue, but not so large as
the lesser white: the flowers are long and narrow, almost as large
as the last white, but nothing so large as the first white, of a
faire yellowish browne colour, as if the yellow were ouershadowed
with a reddish colour, and is that colour wee vsually call an Orenge
tawnie colour: the seede is like the former: the rootes perish euery
yeare that they beare seede, which is vsually the second yeare of the
springing.


4. _Digitalis maior alba._   The greater white Foxegloue.

This white Foxegloue is in all things so like vnto the purple wilde
kinde, that it can hardly be distinguished from it, vnlesse it be in
the fresher greennesse and largenesse of the leaues: the flowers are as
great in a manner as the purple, but wholly white, without any spot in
them: the seed and other things agree in all points.


5. _Digitalis alba altera seu minor._   The lesser white Foxegloue.

We haue in our Gardens another sort of white Foxegloue, whose leaues
are like vnto the last described, but not altogether so long or large,
and of a darker greene colour: the stalke groweth not so high, as not
full three foote: the flowers are pure white, fashioned like vnto the
former, but not so great or large, in all other things alike: the
rootes hereof did abide sometime in our Gardens, but since perished,
and the seede also, since when we neuer could obtaine from any our
friends of that kinde againe.


6. _Digitalis maior lutea flore amplo._   The great yellow Foxegloue.

The leaues of this greater yellow Foxegloue, are in forme somewhat
like vnto the common purple kinde, but not altogether so large: the
stalke groweth to bee three or foure foote high, whereon stand many
long hollow pendulous flowers, in shape like the ordinary purple: but
somewhat shorter, and more large and open at the brimmes, of a faire
yellow colour, wherein are long threads, like as in the others: the
roote hereof is greater at the head, and more wooddy then any of the
rest, with many smaller fibres, spreading themselues in the ground, and
abideth almost as well as our common purple kinde.


7. _Digitalis minor lutea siue pallida._
The small pale yellow Foxegloue.

This small pale yellow Foxegloue hath somewhat short, broad, smooth and
darke greene leaues, snipt or dented about the edges very finely: the
stalke is two foot high, beset with such like leaues, but lesser: the
flowers are more in number then in any of the rest, except the first
and greatest, and growe along the vpper part of the stalke, being long
and hollow, like the other, but very small, and of a pale yellow colour
almost white: the seede vessels are small like the former, wherein are
contained seede like the rest, but smaller: the rootes are stringy, but
durable, and seldome perish with any iniury of the extreamest frosts.


        The Place.

        The great white kinde hath been often, and in many places found
        wilde in our owne Country, among or hard by the common purple
        kinde. All the rest are strangers, but cherished in our Gardens.


        The Time.

        They flower in Iune and Iuly, and some in August, their seede
        becomming ripe quickly after.


        The Names.

        Onely the name _Digitalis_, is of all Writers giuen vnto these
        plants; for it is not knowne to bee remembred of any of the old
        Authors. Wee call them generally in English, Foxegloue; but
        some (as thinking it to bee too foolish a name) doe call them
        Finger-flowers, because they are like vnto the fingers of a
        gloue, the ends cut off.


        The Vertues.

        Foxegloues are not vsed in Physicke by any iudicious man that I
        know; yet some Italians of Bononia, as Camerarius saith, in his
        time vsed it as a wound herbe.




CHAP. XCVIII.

_Verbascum._   Mullein.


There be diuers kindes of Mullein, as white Mullein, blacke Mullein,
wooddy Mullein, base Mullein, Moth Mullein, and Ethiopian Mullein,
all which to distinguish or to describe, is neither my purpose, nor
the intent of this worke, which is to store a Garden with flowers of
delight, and sequester others not worthy of that honour. Those that
are fit to bee brought to your consideration in this place, are first,
the _Blattarias_, or Moth Mulleins, and then the wooddy Mullein, which
otherwise is called French Sage, and lastly, the Ethiopian Mullein,
whose beauty consisteth not in the flower, but in the whole plant; yet
if it please you not, take it according to his Country for a Moore, an
Infidell, a Slaue, and so vse it.


1. _Blattaria lutea odorata._   Sweete yellow Moth Mullein.

The yellow Moth Mullein whose flower is sweete, hath many hard grayish
greene leaues lying on the ground, somewhat long and broad, and pointed
at the end: the stalks are two or three foot high, with some leaues on
them, & branching out from the middle vpwards into many long branches,
stored with many small pale yellow flowers, of a pretty sweete sent,
somewhat stronger then in the other sorts, which seldome giueth seede,
but abideth in the roote, during many yeares, which few or none of the
others doe.


2. _Blattaria lutea maior siue Hispanica._
The great yellow Moth Mullein.

This Spanish kinde hath larger and greener leaues then the former, and
rounder and larger then the next that followeth: the stalke is higher
than in any of the Moth Mulleins, being for the most part foure or fiue
foote high, whereon toward the toppe growe many goodly yellow flowers,
consisting of fiue leaues, as all the rest doe, not so thicke set as
the former, but much larger, with some small purplish threads in the
middle: the ends whereof are fashioned somewhat like as if a Flie were
creeping vp the flower, which turne into round heads, sometimes two or
three or more standing together, but vsually one, wherein lye small
duskie seed: the roote is not great nor full of threads, and doth
perish most vsually hauing giuen seede, except the Winter bee very
milde.


3. _Blattaria lutea altera vulgatior._
The ordinary yellow Moth Mullein.

This yellow Moth Mullein (which is the most frequent in our Gardens)
hath longer, and narrower leaues then any of the former, and roundly
notched or dented on the edges, of a darke greene colour: the stalke is
sometimes branched, but most vsually single, whereon stand many gold
yellow flowers, not fully so large as the Spanish kinde, but with the
like purple threads in the middle: the seede is small, and contained
in the like round heads, but alwaies euery one single by it selfe: the
roote perisheth euery yeare that it beareth seede.


4. _Blattaria flore luteo purpurascente._   Cloth of gold Moth Mullein.

The greatest point of difference betweene this and the last described,
consisteth chiefly in the colour of the flower, which in this is of the
colour of cloth of gold, that is, the ground yellow, and ouershadowed
with a bright crimson colour, which is a fine colour of much delight:
the threads in the middle are not so purple red as in the former, but
much about the colour of the flower: this is not so willing to giue
seede, and will as hardly abide in the roote, and hath out of question
risen from the seede of the former.


5. _Blattaria flore albo._   White Moth Mullein.

The leaues of the white Moth Mullein are somewhat like vnto the yellow,
yet not altogether so much roundly notched about the edges, but rather
a little dented, with sharper notches: the stalke riseth as high as
the yellow, and hath now and then some branches about it: the flowers
hereof are pure white, as large and great as the ordinary yellow, or
somewhat larger, with the like purple threads in the middle, as are
in the yellow: the seed is like the other; the root perisheth in like
manner, and will not endure.


6. _Blattaria flore purpureo._   Purple Moth Mullein.

The Purple Moth Mullein hath his leaues lying on the ground, broader
and shorter then any of the other, of a more grayish greene colour, and
without any denting for the most part about the edges, sharpe pointed
also at the end of the leafe; among the leaues riseth vp the stalke,
not so high as either the white or the yellow, and many times branched,
bearing many flowers thereon, of the same fashion, and no whit smaller,
of a faire deepe blewish colour tending to rednesse, the threads in
the middle of the flowers being yellow: the seede vessels hereof are
somewhat smaller then any of the former, except the first sweete yellow
kinde: the roote hereof is long, thicke, and blackish on the outside,
abiding very well from yeare to yeare, and riseth well also from the
sowing of the seede.


7. _Blattaria flore cæruleo._   Blew Moth Mullein.

This blew Moth Mullein is in all respects like vnto the former purple
kinde, sauing onely in the colour of the flower, which is of a blewish
violet colour, and is not much inferiour either in greatnesse of the
plant, or in the largenesse of the flower, vnto the former purple
kinde, and endureth many yeares in the like manner. And these be all
the sorts of this kinde of Moth Mullein, that I haue seene and noursed
vp for this my Garden, without interposing any vnknowne, not seene, or
vnworthy.


8. _Verbascum siluestre siue quartum Matthioli._
Wooddy Mullein or French Sage.

Wooddy Mullein or French Sage, hath diuers wooddy branches two or
three foot high, very hoary or white, whereon at seuerall ioynts stand
diuers thicke leaues, white also and hoary, long, somewhat broad, round
pointed, and rough, somewhat resembling the leaues of Sage in the
forme and roughnesse, but not in the sent, whereof our people gaue
it the name of Sage, calling it French Sage (when as it is as great a
stranger in France as in England, yet they doe with this as with many
other things, calling them French, which come from beyond the Seas;
as for example, all or most of our bulbous flowers, they call French
flowers, &c.) at the toppes of the stalkes and branches, at certaine
distances, are placed round about them many gaping flowers, like vnto
the flowers of Sage, but yellow: after which now and then come seede,
somewhat bigger then the Moth Mulleins, and lesse then the next Mullein
of Ethiopia: the roote is wooddy at the toppe, with diuers blackish
strings growing from it, and endureth as well aboue ground with his
leaues, as vnder it with his rootes.


9. _Æthiopis._   Ethiopian Mullein.

This Mullein of Ethiopia hath many great, broad, and large leaues
lying on the ground, rent or torne in diuers of them very much on the
sides, of so hoary a white greene colour, that it farre passeth any of
the white Mulleins, that growe wilde abroad in our owne Country; for
they are of a yellowish white hoarinesse, nothing so pleasant to looke
on as this: in the middle of these leaues riseth vp a square strong
stalke, foure or fiue foote high, set full of such like leaues as growe
belowe, but much lesser, and lesser still vp to the toppe, all hoary
and woolly, as the rest, and diuided into manie branches, spreading
farre, and taking vp a great compasse of ground, more then any one
roote of Garden Clary, or other such like plant: at each of the stalkes
and branches are set two small leaues, and with them, round about the
stalkes, stand many small gaping flowers, of a pale bleake blew colour:
the seede is almost as large as Garden Clary seede, and of the same
forme and colour: the roote is wooddy, and perisheth as soone as it
hath borne seede, which is vsually the second yeare after the sowing;
for the first yeare it seldome runneth vp to flower.


10. _Lamium Pannonicum siue Galeopsis Pannonica._
Hungary dead Nettle or the Dragon flower.

Let mee thrust this plant into this place, rather then make a peculiar
Chapter, because I haue no other of the same stocke or kindred to
be ioyned with it, and is a pretty ornament in a Garden. The leaues
whereof are very large, round, and great, rough or full of veines,
which make it seeme crumpled, dented or deepely notched about the
edges, and of a very darke greene colour, and some times brownish,
or of a darke reddish colour withall, euery one standing on a long
foote-stalke, very like in forme vnto the great white Arch-Angell
leaues, but farre larger and blacker: the stalkes are great and foure
square, hauing leaues and flowers standing round about them at the
ioynts like coronets, which flowers are very great, long, and wide
gaping open, of a darke red or purple colour, with some whitenesse or
spots in the iawes, and some hairinesse also on the sides, which stand
in full flower two or three moneths most vsually, and sometimes longer,
after which come brownish seede: the roote is a great tuft or bush
of long whitish strings, and encreaseth euery yeare, not fearing the
greatest iniuries of our coldest and extreamest Winters.


        The Place.

        All these plants are strangers in our Countrey, and onely
        preserued in Gardens, to furnish them with variety; but (as I
        said) the cloth of gold Moth Mullein hath been raised from seed
        in our owne Country.


        The Time.

        The last flowreth first, before all the rest, beginning in
        Aprill. The Moth Mulleins in May and Iune. The French Sage in
        Iuly.


        The Names.

        All the sorts of _Blattaria_ may bee comprehended vnder the
        kindes of _Verbascum nigrum_, as any one but meanely exercised
        in the knowledge of plants, may discerne. And although Plinie
        saith, that Moths doe most frequently haunt where _Blattaria_
        either groweth, or is laid, yet it is not obserued sufficiently
        in our Country so to doe, notwithstanding the name of Moth
        Mullein is generally giuen them. The last is generally called
        with vs _Lamium Pannonicum_, but certainely it is the _Galeosis
        maxima Pannonica_ of Clusius.


        The Vertues.

        Other qualities I haue not found hath been alloted vnto the
        _Blattaria_ or Moth Mullein, then those of Plinie, to engender
        Moths. Wee vse none of these plants in Physicke in these daies.




CHAP. XCIX.

_Valeriana._   Valerian.


The many sorts of Valerian (or Set-wall as many doe call them) are
fitter for a generall worke, or a generall Physicall Garden of Simples,
then this of delightfull flowers. I will therefore select out a few,
worthy of the place, and offer them to your considerations.


1. _Valeriana rubra Dodonæi._   Red Valerian.

This Valerian hath diuers hard, but brittle whitish greene stalkes,
rising from the roote, full of tuberous or swelling ioynts, whereat
stand two leaues, on each side one, and now and then some small leaues
from betweene them, which are somewhat long and narrow, broadest in the
middle, and small at both ends, without either diuision or incisure on
the edges, of a pale greene colour: the stalkes are branched at the top
into diuers parts, at the ends whereof stand many flowers together, as
it were in an vmbell or tuft, somewhat like vnto the flowers of our
ordinary Valerian, but with longer neckes, and of a fine red colour,
very pleasant to behold, but of no sent of any Valerian: after these
flowers haue stood blowne a very great while, they sodainely fall away,
and the seede is ripe very quickly after, which is whitish, standing
vpon the branches naked, as the Valerians doe, and very like vnto them,
with a little white doune at the end of euery one of them, whereby they
are soone carried away with the winde: the roote is great, thicke, and
white, continuing long, and shooting out new branches euery yeare, and
smelling somewhat like a Valerian.


2. _Nardus Montana tuberosa._   Knobbed Mountaine Valerian.

This kinde of Valerian or Spiknard, if you will so call it, hath his
first leaues lying on the ground, without any diuision in them at
all, being smooth, and of a darke greene colour, which so abide all
the winter; but those that spring vp after, and when it runneth vp to
flower, are cut in on the edges, very like vnto the iagged leaues of
the great garden Valerian, and so the elder they grow, the more cut and
iagged they are: the stalke and flowers are very like the stalke with
flowers of the garden Valerian, but of a darke or deepe red colour, and
more store of them thrust together, by double the number almost: the
seede is like the seede of the great Valerian: the root is tuberous,
or knobbed in many parts, round about, aboue and below also, with some
fibres shooting from them, whereby it is encreased, and smelleth very
like the roote of the garden Setwall, or not altogether so strong.

   8 _Cardamine flore pleno._ Double Cuckowe flower or Ladies smocks.
]


3. _Valeriana Græca._   Greeke Valerian.

The Greek Valerian hath many winged leaues lying vpon the ground, that
is, many small leaues set on both sides of a middle ribbe, very like
vnto the wilde Valerian, that groweth by the ditch sides, but much
smaller and tenderer, among which rise vp one or two round brittle
stalkes, two foote high or thereabouts, whereon are set at the ioynts,
such like leaues as grow below, but smaller: the toppes of the stalkes
are diuided into many small branches, thicke set together, full with
flowers, consisting of fiue small round leaues a peece, layd open like
vnto the Cinquefoile flower, with some white threds in the middle, tipt
with yellow pendents: the colour of these flowers in some plants, is of
a faire bleake blew colour, and in others pure white: And I doe heare
of one beyond the Seas (if the report bee true, for I haue not seene
such a one) which should beare red flowers: after the flowers are past,
there come vp in their places small hard huskes or heads, containing
small blackish seedes: the roote is composed of a number of small long
blackish threds, fastened together at the head, without any sent at all
of a Valerian, eyther in roote or leafe; and why it should bee called
a Valerian I see no great reason, for it agreeth with none of them, in
flower or seede, and but onely with the wilde Valerian in leafe, as I
said before: but as it is, we so giue it you, and for the flowers sake
is receiued into our gardens, to helpe to fill vp the number of natures
rarities and varieties.


        The Place.

        All these Valerians are strangers, but endenizond for their
        beauties sake in our Gardens. The Mountaine Valerian I had of
        the liberalitie of my louing friend Iohn Tradescante, who in
        his trauaile, and search of natures varieties, met with it, and
        imparted thereof vnto me.


        The Time.

        They flower in the Summer moneths, and seed quickly after.


        The Names.

        The first is generally called of most, _Valeriana rubra
        Dodonæi_, who saith also that some would haue it to be _Behen
        rubrum_. Some call it _Valerianthon_, others make it a kinde of
        _Ocimastrum_, and some _Saponaria altera_, with other names,
        which are to no great purpose to set downe in this place,
        it beeing fitter for a generall worke to discusse of names,
        wherein both reading, knowledge and iudgement must bee shewen,
        to correct errours, and set downe the truth, that one may rest
        thereon. The others haue their names in their titles sufficient
        to distinguish them.


        The Vertues.

        The Mountaine Valerian is of all the rest here set downe of
        most vse in Physicke, the rest hauing little or none that I
        know, although it be much weaker then the great garden kinde,
        or the Indian Nardus, in whose steed anciently it was vsed, in
        oyles, oyntments, &c.




CHAP. C.

_Cardamine._   Cuckow flowers, or Ladies smockes.


Of the common sorts of Cuckow flowers that grow by ditch-sides, or in
moist medowes, & wet grounds, it is not my purpose here to write, but
of one or two other, the most specious or faire of all the tribe, that
doe best befit this garden.


1. _Cardamine flore pleno._   Double Cuckow flowers.

The double _Cardamine_ hath a few winged leaues, weake and tender,
lying on the ground, very like vnto the single medow kinde; from among
which riseth vp a round greene stalke, set here and there, with the
like leaues that grow below, the top whereof hath a few branches,
whereon stand diuers flowers, euery one vpon a small footestalk,
consisting of many small whitish round leaues, a little dasht ouer
with a shew of blush, set round together, which make a double flower:
the roote creepeth vnder ground, sending forth small white fibres, and
shooteth vp in diuers places.


2. _Cardamine trifolia._   Trefoile Ladies smockes.

This small plant hath diuers hard, darke round greene leaues, somewhat
vneuen about the edges, alwayes three set together on a blackish small
footstalke, among which rise vp small round blackish stalkes, halfe a
foote high, with three small leaues at the ioynts, where they branch
forth; at the toppes whereof stand many flowers, consisting of foure
leaues a peece, of a whitish or blush colour very pale: after which
come vp small, thicke and long pods, wherein is contained small round
seede: the root is composed of many white threds, from the heads
whereof runne out small strings, of a dark purple colour, whereby it
encreaseth.


        The Place.

        The first with the double flower is found in diuers places
        of our owne Countrey, as neere Micham about eight miles from
        London; also in Lancashire, from whence I receiued a plant,
        which perished, but was found by the industrie of a worthy
        Gentlewoman, dwelling in those parts heretofore remembred,
        called Mistresse Thomasin Tunstall, a great louer of these
        delights. The other was sent me by my especiall good friend
        Iohn Tradescante, who brought it among other dainty plants from
        beyond the Seas, and imparted thereof a roote to me.


        The Time.

        The last most vsually flowreth before the former, yet not much
        differing, that is, in the end of Aprill or in May.


        The Names.

        The first is a double kinde of that plant, that growing wilde
        abroade, is vsually called _Cardamine altera_, and _Sisymbrium
        alterum_ of Dioscorides, and of some _Flos cuculi_, but not
        fitly; for that name is more vsually giuen vnto the wilde
        featherd Campion, both single and double, as is before
        expressed: yet for want of a fitter name, wee may call it in
        English, eyther Cuckowe flower, or Ladyes smockes which you
        will. The second hath beene sent vnder the name of _Sanicula
        trifolia_, but the most frequent name now receiued, is
        _Cardamine trifolia_, and in English Trefoile Ladies smockes.


        The Vertues.

        The double Ladies smockes are of the same qualitie with the
        single, and is thought to be as effectuall as Watercresses. The
        propertie of the other I thinke is not much knowne, although
        some would make it a wound herbe.




CHAP. CI.

_Thlaspi Creticum._   Candy Tufts.


Of the many sorts of _Thlaspi_ it is not the scope of this worke to
relate, I will select but onely two or three, which for their beautie
are fit to bee inserted into this garden.


_Thlaspi Creticum vmbellatum flore albo & purpureo._
Candy Tufts white and purple.

This small plant riseth seldome aboue a foote and a halfe high, hauing
small, narrow, long and whitish greene leaues, notched or dented
with three or foure notches on each side, from the middle to the
point-wards; from among which rise vp the stalkes, branched from the
bottome almost into diuers small branches, at the toppes whereof stand
many small flowers, thick thrust together in an vmbell or tuft, making
them seeme to be small, round, double flowers of many leaues, when as
euery flower is single, and standeth a part by it selfe, of a faire
white colour in some plants, without any spot, and in others with a
purplish spot in the centre or middle, as if some of the middle leaues
were purple; in others agane the whole flower is purplish all ouer,
which make a pretty shew in a garden: the seede is contained in many
small and flat seed vessels, which stand together in an vmbell, as the
flowers did, in which are contained somewhat reddish seede, like vnto
some other sorts of _Thlaspi_, called Treakle Mustards: the roote is
small and hard, and perisheth euery yeare hauing giuen seede.

[Sidenote: _Thlaspi Marinum Bæticum._]

We haue another sort, whose leaues before it sendeth forth any stalke,
are a little toothed, or finely dented about the edges, and brancheth
not so much out, but carryeth an vmbell of purplish flowers like vnto
the former, and paler yellow seede.


        The Place.

        These doe grow in Spaine and Candie, not farre from the Sea
        side.


        The Time.

        These _Thlaspi_ giue not their flowers vntill the end of Iune,
        or beginning of Iuly, and the seed is ripe soone after.


        The Names.

        The first is named by some, _Draba_, or _Arabis_, as Dodonæus,
        but _Draba_ is another plant differing much from this. Wee call
        one sort, _Thlaspi Creticum_, and the other _Thlaspi Bæticum
        marinum_, because the one came from Spaine, and the other from
        Candy; we giue it in English, the name of Tufts, because it
        doth fit the forme of the flowers best, although ordinarily all
        the _Thlaspi_ are Englished Wilde Mustardes.


        The Vertues.

        Candy, or Spanish Tufts, is not so sharpe biting in taste,
        as some other of the Thlaspies are, and therefore is not to
        be vsed in medicines, where _Thlaspi_ should be in the stead
        thereof.




CHAP. CII.

_Clematis._   Clamberers, or Creepers.


Hauing shewed you all my store of herbes bearing fine flowers, let
mee now bring to your consideration the rest of those plants, be they
Shrubs or Trees, that are cherished in our garden, for the beauty of
their flowers chiefly, or for some other beautifull respect: and first
I will begin with such as creepe on the ground, without climing, and
then such as clime vp by poles, or other things, that are set or grow
neere them, fit to make Bowers, and Arbours, or else are like them in
forme, in name, or some other such qualitie or propertie.


1. _Clematis Daphnoides, siue Vinca peruinca simplex minor diuersorum
colorum._   Single Perwinkle of diuers colours.

The smaller Perwinkle which not onely groweth wilde in many places, but
is most vsuall in our Gardens, hath diuers creeping branches, trayling
or running vpon the ground, shooting out small fibres at the ioynts, as
it creepeth, taking thereby hold in the ground, and rooteth in diuers
places: at the ioynts of these branches stand two small darke greene
shining leaues, somewhat like vnto small Baye leaues, but smaller, and
at the ioynts likewise with the leaues, come forth the flowers, one at
a ioynt, standing vpon a tender footestalke, being somewhat long and
hollow, parted at the brims, sometimes into foure leaues, and sometimes
into fiue, the most ordinary sort is of a pale or bleake blew colour,
but some are pure white, and some of a darke reddish purple colour: the
root is in the body of it, little bigger then a rush, bushing in the
ground, and creeping with his branches farre about, taking roote in
many places, whereby it quickely possesseth a great compasse; and is
therefore most vsually planted vnder hedges, or where it may haue roome
to runne.


2. _Vinca peruinca flore duplici purpureo._   Double purple Perwinkle.

The double Perwinkle is like vnto the former single kinde, in all
things except in the flower, which is of that darke reddish purple
colour that is in one of the single kindes; but this hath another row
of leaues within the flower, so that the two rowes of leaues causeth
it to be called double, but the leaues of these are lesser then the
single. I haue heard of one with a double white flower, but I haue not
yet seene it.


3. _Clematis Daphnoides siue Peruinca maior._   The greater Perwinkle.

This greater Perwinkle is somewhat like the former, but greater, yet
his branches creepe not in that manner, but stand more vpright, or
lesse creeping at the least: the leaues also hereof stand by couples at
the ioynts, but they are broader and larger by the halfe: the flowers
are larger, consisting of fiue leaues that are blew, a little deeper
then the former blew: this plant is farre tenderer to keepe then the
other, and therefore would stand warme, as well as in a moist shadowie
place.


4. _Clematis altera siue vrens flore albo._
Burning Clamberer, or Virgins Bower.

This Causticke or burning Climer, hath very long and climing tender
branches, yet somewhat woody below, which winde about those things that
stand neere it, couered with a brownish greene barke, from the ioynts
whereof shoote forth many winged leaues, consisting for the most part
of fiue single leaues, that is two and two together, and one at the
end, which are a little cut in or notched on the edges here and there,
but euery part of them is lesser then the leaues of the next following
Climer, without any clasping tendrels to winde about any thing at
all: towards the vpper part of the branches, with the said leaues,
come forth long stalks, whereon stand many white flowers clustering
together, opening the brims into sixe or eight small leaues, spreading
like a starre, very sweet of smell, or rather of a strong heady sent,
which after turne into flattish and blackish seede, plumed at the head,
which plume or feather flyeth away with the winde after it hath stood
long, and leaueth the seede naked or bare: the roote is white and
thicke, fleshie and tender, or easie to be broken, as my selfe can well
testifie, in that desiring to take a sucker from the roote, I could
not handle it so tenderly, but that it broke notwithstanding all my
care. Master Gerard in his Herball maketh mention of one of this kinde
with double white flowers, which hee saith he recouered from the seede
was sent him from Argentine, that is Strasborough, whereof hee setteth
forth the figure with double flowers: but I neuer saw any such with
him, neither did I euer heare of any of this kinde with double flowers.
Clusius indeed saith, that hee receiued from a friend some seede vnder
the name of _Clematis flore albo pleno_: but he doubteth whether there
bee any such: the plants that sprang with him from that seede, were
like vnto the vpright kinde called _Flammila Matthioli_, or _Iouis
cresta_, as he there saith: but assuredly I haue beene informed from
some of my especiall friends beyond Sea, that they haue a double white
_Clematis_, and haue promised to send it; but whether it will be of the
climing or vpright sort, I cannot tell vntill I see it: but surely I
doe much doubt whether the double will giue any good seede.


5. _Clematis altera siue peregrina flore rubro._   Red Ladies Bower.

This Climer hath many limber and weake climing branches like the
former, couered with a browne thin outer barke, and greene vnderneath:
the leaues stand at the ioynts, consisting but of three leaues or
parts, whereof some are notched on one side, and some on both, without
any clasping tendrels also, but winding with his branches about any
thing standeth next vnto it: the flowers in like manner come from the
same ioynts with the leaues, but not so many together as the former
vpon long footstalkes, consisting of foure leaues a peece, standing
like a crosse, of a darke red colour; the seed is flat and round, and
pointed at the end, three or foure or more standing close together vpon
one stalk, without any doune vpon them at all, as in the former: the
roots are a bundell of brownish yellow strong strings, running down
deep into the ground, from a bigge head aboue.


6. _Clematis peregrina flore purpureo simplici._
Single purple Ladies Bower.

This Ladies Bower differeth in nothing from the last described, but
onely in the colour of the flower, which is of a sad blewish purple
colour; so that the one is not possible to be known from the other,
vntill they be in flower.


7. _Clematis peregrina flore purpurea pleno._
Double flowred purple Ladies Bower.

This double _Clematis_ hath branches and leaues so neere resembling the
single kinds, that there can be knowne no difference, vnlesse it be,
that this groweth more goale and great, and yeeldeth both more store
of branches from the ground, and more spreading aboue: the chiefest
marke to distinguish it is the flower, which in this is very thicke and
double, consisting of a number of smaller leaues, set close together
in order in the middle, the foure outermost leaues that encompasse
them, being much broader and larger then any of the inward, but all of
a dull or sad blewish purple colour, the points or ends of the leaues
seeming a little darker then the middle of them: this beareth no seede
that euer I could see, heare of, or learne by any of credit, that haue
noursed it a great while; and therefore the tales of false deceitfull
gardiners, and others, that diliuer such for truth, to deceiue persons
ignorant thereof, must not bee credulously entertained.


[Sidenote: _Clematis peregrina flore carneo pleno._]

In the great booke of the Garden of the Bishop of Eystot (which place
is neere vnto Noromberg) in Germany, I reade of a _Clematis_ of this
former kinde, whose figure is thereto also annexed, with double flowers
of an incarnate, or pale purple tending to a blush colour, whereof I
haue not heard from any other place.


8. _Flammula Iouis erecta._   Vpright Virgins Bower.

This kinde of _Clematis_ hath diuers more vpright stalkes then any
of the foure last described, sometimes foure or fiue foote high, or
more: yet leaning or bending a little, so that it had some neede of
sustaining, couered with a brownish barke; from whence come forth on
all sides diuers winged leaues, consisting of fiue or seuen leaues,
set on both sides of a middle ribbe, whereof one is at the end: the
tops of the stalkes are diuided into many branches, bearing many white
sweet smelling flowers on them, like in fashion vnto the white Virgins
Bower; after which come such like feather topt seede, which remaine and
shew themselues, being flat like the other, when the plumes are blowne
abroad: the roote spreadeth in the ground from a thicke head, into many
long strings, and fasteneth it selfe strongly in the earth; but all the
stalkes dye downe euery yeare, and spring afresh in the beginning of
the next.


9. _Clematis cærulea Pannonica._   The Hungarian Climer.

The stalks of this plant stand vpright, & are foure square, bearing at
euery ioynt two leaues, which at the first are closed together, and
after they are open, are somewhat like vnto the leaues of _Asclepias_,
or Swallow-wort: from the tops of the stalks, and sometimes also from
the sides by the leaues commeth forth one flower, bending the head
downward, consisting of foure leaues, somewhat long & narrow, standing
like a crosse, and turning vp their ends a little againe, of a faire
blew or skie colour, with a thicke pale yellow short thrumme, made
like a head in the middle: after the flower is past, the head turneth
into such a like round feather topt ball, as is to be seene in the
Trauellers ioy, or _Viorna_ (as it is called) that groweth plentifully
in Kent, and in other places by the way sides, and in the hedges,
wherein is included such like flat seede. These stalkes (like as the
last) dye downe to the ground euery yeare, and rise againe in the
Spring following, shooting out new branches, and therby encreaseth in
the root.


10. _Maracoc siue Clematis Virginiana._   The Virginia Climer.

Because this braue and too much desired plant doth in some things
resemble the former Climers, so that vnto what other family or kindred
I might better conioyne it I know not; let me I pray insert it in the
end of their Chapter, with this description. It riseth out of the
ground (very late in the yeare, about the beginning of May, if it be a
plant hath risen from the seed of our owne sowing, and if it be an old
one, such as hath been brought to vs from Virginia, not till the end
thereof) with a round stalke, not aboue a yard and a halfe high (in any
that I haue seene) but in hotter Countries, as some Authors haue set it
downe, much higher, bearing one leafe at euery ioynt, which from the
ground to the middle thereof hath no claspers, but from thence vpwards
hath at the same ioynt with the leafe both a small twining clasper,
like vnto a Vine, and a flower also: euery leafe is broad at the stalke
thereof, and diuided about the middle on both sides, making it somewhat
resemble a Figge leafe, ending in three points, whereof the middlemost
is longest: the bud of the flower, before it doe open, is very like
vnto the head or seede vessell of the ordinary single _Nigella_, hauing
at the head or top fiue small crooked hornes, which when this bud
openeth, are the ends or points of fiue leaues, that are white on the
inside, and lay themselues flat, like vnto an Anemone, and are a little
hollow like a scoope at the end, with fiue other smaller leaues, and
whiter then they lying betweene them, which were hid in the bud before
it opened, so that this flower being full blowne open, consisteth of
ten white leaues, laide in order round one by another: from the bottome
of these leaues on the inside, rise diuers twined threads, which spread
and lay themselues all ouer these white leaues, reaching beyond the
points of them a little, and are of a reddish peach colour: towards the
bottomes likewise of these white leaues there are two red circles,
about the breadth of an Oten strawe, one distant from another (and in
some flowers there is but one circle seen) which adde a great grace
vnto the flower; for the white leaues shew their colour through the
peach coloured threads, and these red circles or rings vpon them being
also perspicuous, make a tripartite shew of colours most delightfull:
the middle part of this flower is hollow, and yellowish; in the bottome
whereof riseth vp an vmbone, or round stile, somewhat bigge, of a
whitish greene colour, spotted with reddish spots like the stalkes of
Dragons, with fiue round threads or chiues, spotted in the like manner,
and tipt at the ends with yellow pendents, standing about the middle
part of the said vmbone, and from thence rising higher, endeth in three
long crooked hornes most vsually (but sometimes in foure, as hath beene
obserued in Rome by Dʳ. Aldine, that set forth some principall things
of Cardinall Farnesius his Garden) spotted like the rest, hauing three
round greene buttons at their ends: these flowers are of a comfortable
sweete sent, very acceptable, which perish without yeelding fruit with
vs, because it flowreth so late: but in the naturall place, and in hot
Countries, it beareth a small round whitish fruit, with a crowne at the
toppe thereof, wherein is contained (while it is fresh, and before it
be ouer dried) a sweet liquor, but when it is dry, the seede within it,
which is small, flat, somewhat rough and blacke, will make a ratling
noise: the rootes are composed of a number of exceeding long and round
yellowish browne strings, spreading farre abroad vnder the ground (I
haue seene some rootes that haue beene brought ouer, that were as long
as any rootes of _Sarsaparilla_, and a great deale bigger, which to be
handsomely laid into the ground, were faine to be coyled like a cable)
and shooting vp in seuerall places a good distance one from another,
whereby it may be well encreased.

        The Place.

        The first blew Perwinkle groweth in many Woods and Orchards,
        by the hedge sides in England, and so doth the white here
        and there, but the other single and double purple are in our
        Gardens onely. The great Perwinkle groweth in Prouence of
        France, in Spaine, and Italy, and other hot Countries, where
        also growe all the twining Clamberers, as well single as
        double: but both the vpright ones doe growe in Hungary and
        there abouts. The surpassing delight of all flowers came from
        Virginia. Wee preserue them all in our Gardens.


        The Time.

        The Perwinkles doe flower in March and Aprill. The Climers not
        vntill the end of Iune, or in Iuly, and sometimes in August.
        The Virginian somewhat later in August; yet sometimes I haue
        knowne the flower to shew it selfe in Iuly.

]


        The Names.

        The first is out of question the first _Clematis_ of
        Dioscorides, and called of many _Clematis Daphnoides_ (but
        not that plant that is simply called _Daphnoides_, for that
        is _Laureola_) and is vsually called _Vinca pervinca_: but it
        is not _Chamædaphne_, for that is another plant, as shall be
        shewed in his place; some call it _Centunculus_: In English
        wee call it Perwinkle. The other is _Clematis altera_ of
        Dioscorides, and is called also _Clematis peregrina_, whose
        distinctions are set downe in their titles: In English, Ladies
        Bower, or Virgins Bower, because they are fit to growe by
        Arbours, to couer them. The first vpright Clamberer is called,
        and that rightly of some, _Clematis erecta_, or _surrecta_.
        Of others, _Flammula frutex_, and _Flammula Iouis_, or
        _surrecta_: In English, Vpright Virgins Bower. The next is
        called by Clusius, _Clematis Pannonica cæulea_, who thought
        it to be _Climeni species_, by the relation of others, at the
        first, but after entituled it, _Clematis_: In English, the
        Hungarian Climer. The last may be called in Latine, _Clematis
        Virginiana_: In English, The Virgin or Virginian Climer;
        of the Virginians, _Maracoc_: of the Spaniards in the West
        Indies _Granadillo_, because the fruit (as is before said)
        is in some fashion like a small Pomegranate on the outside;
        yet the seede within is flattish, round, and blackish. Some
        superstitious Iesuite would faine make men beleeue, that in
        the flower of this plant are to be seene all the markes of our
        Sauiours Passion; and therefore call it _Flos Passionis_: and
        to that end haue caused figures to be drawne, and printed, with
        all the parts proportioned out, as thornes, nailes, speare,
        whippe, pillar, &c. in it, and all as true as the Sea burnes,
        which you may well perceiue by the true figure, taken to the
        life of the plant, compared with the figures set forth by the
        Iesuites, which I haue placed here likewise for euery one to
        see: but these bee their aduantagious lies (which with them
        are tolerable, or rather pious and meritorious) wherewith
        they vse to instruct their people; but I dare say, God neuer
        willed his Priests to instruct his people with lyes: for they
        come from the Diuell, the author of them. But you may say I
        am beside my Text, and I am in doubt you will thinke, I am in
        this besides my selfe, and so nothing to be beleeued herein
        that I say. For, for the most part, it is an inherent errour
        in all of that side, to beleeue nothing, be it neuer so true,
        that any of our side shall affirme, that contrarieth the
        assertions of any of their Fathers, as they call them: but I
        must referre them to God, and hee knoweth the truth, and will
        reforme or deforme them in his time. In regard whereof I could
        not but speake (the occasion being thus offered) against such
        an erroneous opinion (which euen Dʳ. Aldine at Rome, before
        remembred, disproued, and contraried both the said figures and
        name) and seek to disproue it, as doth (I say not almost, but I
        am affraid altogether) leade many to adore the very picture of
        such things, as are but the fictions of superstitious brains:
        for the flower it selfe is farre differing from their figure,
        as both Aldine in the aforesaid booke, and Robinus at Paris in
        his _Theatrum Floræ_, doe set forth; the flowers and leaues
        being drawne to the life, and there exhibited, which I hope may
        satisfie all men, that will not be perpetually obstinate and
        contentious.


        The Vertues.

        Costæus saith hee hath often seene, that the leaues of
        Perwinkle held in the mouth, hath stayed the bleeding at the
        nose. The French doe vse it to stay the menstruall fluxes. The
        other are causticke plants, that is, fiery hot, and blistering
        the skinne; and therefore (as Dioscorides saith) is profitable
        to take away the scurfe, leprye, or such like deformities of
        the skin. What property that of Virginia hath, is not knowne to
        any with vs I thinke, more then that the liquor in the greene
        fruit is pleasant in taste; but assuredly it cannot be without
        some speciall properties, if they were knowne.




CHAP. CIII.

_Chamælæa._   Dwarfe Spurge Oliue, or Dwarfe Baye.


I haue three sorts of _Chamælæa_ to bring to your consideration, euery
one differing notably from other; two of them of great beauty in their
flowers, as well as in the whole plant: the third abiding with greene
leaues, although it haue no beauty in the flower, yet worthy of the
place it holds. And vnto these I must adioyne another plant, as comming
nearest vnto them in the brauery of the flowers.


1. _Chamælæa Germanica siue Mezereon floribus dilutioris coloris &
saturatioris._   Dwarfe Bay, or flowring Spurge Oliue.

We haue two sorts of this Spurge Oliue or Dwarfe Baye, differing onely
in the colour of the flowers. They both rise vp with a thicke wooddy
stemme, fiue or six foot high sometimes, or more, and of the thicknesse
(if they be very old) of a mans wrest at the ground, spreading into
many flexible long branches, couered with a tough grayish barke,
beset with small long leaues, somewhat like vnto Priuet leaues, but
smaller and paler, and in a manner round pointed: the flowers are
small, consisting of foure leaues, many growing together sometimes, and
breaking out of the branches by themselues: in the one sort of a pale
red at the first blowing, and more white afterwards; the other of a
deeper red in the blossome, and continuing of a deeper red colour all
the time of the flowring, both of them very sweete in smell: after the
flowers are past, come the berries, which are greene at the first, and
very red afterwards, turning blackish red, if they stand too long vpon
the branches: the rootes spread into many tough long branches, couered
with a yellowish barke.


2. _Chamælæa Alpina._   Mountaine Spurge Oliue.

This Mountaine Laurell riseth vp with a small wooddy stemme, three or
foure foot high, or more, branching forth towards the vpper parts into
many slender and tough branches, couered with a rough hoary greene
barke, beset at the ends thereof with flatter, fuller, and smaller
round pointed leaues then the former, of a grayish greene colour on the
vpperside, and hoary vnderneath, which abide on the branches in Winter,
and fall not away as the former: the flowers are many set together
at the ends of the branches, greater then the former, and consisting
of foure leaues a peece, of a light blush colour, standing in small
grayish huskes, of little or no sent at all: the fruit followeth, which
are small long graines or berries, of an excellent red colour, which
afterwards turne blacke: the roote is long, and spreadeth about vnder
the vpper part of the earth.


3. _Chamælæa tricoccos._   Widowe Wayle.

This three berried Spurge Oliue hath no great stemme at all, but the
whole plant spreadeth from the ground into many flexible tough greene
branches, whereon are set diuers narrow, long, darke greene leaues all
along the branches, which abide greene all the Winter: the flowers are
very small, scarce to be seene, and come forth between the leaues and
the stalke, of a pale yellow colour, made of three leaues; after which
come small blackish berries, three vsually set together; the roote
spreadeth it selfe in the ground not very farre, being hard and wooddy,
and often dyeth, if it bee not well defended from the extremity of our
sharpe Winters.


4. _Cneorum Matthioli._   Small Rocke Roses.

I was long in doubt in what place I should dispose of this plant,
whether among the Campions, as Bauhinus, or among these, as Clusius
doth; but lest my Garden should want it wholly, let it take vp roome
for this time here. This gallant plant hath diuers long, weake,
slender, but yet tough branches lying vpon the ground, diuided vsually
into other smaller branches, whereon growe many, small, long, and
somewhat thicke leaues, somewhat like vnto the leaues of the former
_Mezereon_, set without any order to the very tops, from whence doe
come forth a tuft of many small flowers together, made or consisting
of foure leaues a peece, of a bright red or carnation colour, and very
sweete withall, which turne into small round whitish berries, wherein
is contained small round seede, couered with a grayish coate or skinne:
the roote is long and yellowish, spreading diuers wayes vnder the
ground, and abideth many yeares shooting forth new branches.

[Sidenote: _Flore albo._]

It hath beene obserued in some of these plants, to bring forth white
flowers, not differing in any thing else.


        The Place.

        The first sorts growe plentifully in many places of Germany.
        The second in the mountaines by Sauoye. The third in Prouence
        and Spaine. The last in diuers parts of Germany, Bohemia, and
        Austria, and about Franckford.


        The Time.

        The two first sorts are most vsually in flower about Christmas,
        or in Ianuary, if the weather be not violent, and sometimes not
        vntill February. The second flowreth not vntill Aprill. The
        third in May. The berries of them ripen some in Iune and Iuly;
        some in August and September, as their flowring is earlier or
        later. The last flowreth as well in the Spring as in Autumne,
        so apt and plentifull it is in bearing, and the seede at both
        times doth ripen soone after.


        The Names.

        The first is called of some _Chamælæa_, with this addition
        _Germanica_, that it may differ from the third, which is the
        true _Chamælæa_ of Dioscorides, as all the best Authors doe
        agree, and is also called _Piper montanum_ of the Italians.
        It is generally called _Mezereon_, and is indeede the true
        _Mezereon_ of the Arabians, and so vsed in our Apothecaries
        shops, wheresoeuer the Arabians _Mezereon_ is appointed,
        although the Arabians are so intricate and vncertaine in the
        descriptions of their plants, confounding _Chamælæa_ and
        _Thymælæa_ together. Matthiolus maketh it to be _Daphnoides_
        of Dioscorides; but in my opinion he is therein mistaken: for
        all our best moderne Writers doe account our _Laureola_, which
        hath blacke berries, to bee the true _Daphnoides_: the errour
        of his Countrey might peraduenture drawe him thereunto; but if
        hee had better considered the text of Dioscorides, that giueth
        black berries to _Daphnoides_, and red to _Chamædaphne_, he
        would not so haue written; and truly, I should thinke (as Lobel
        doth) with better reason, that this _Chamælæa_ were Dioscorides
        _Chamædaphne_, then hee to say it were _Daphnoides_: for the
        description of _Chamædaphne_, may in all parts be very fitly
        applyed to this _Chamælæa_: and euen these words, _Semen
        annexum folijs_, wherein may be the greatest doubt in the
        description, may not vnfitly bee construed, that as is seene in
        the plant, the berries growe at the foote of the leaues, about
        the branches: the faculties indeede that Dioscorides giueth to
        _Chamædaphne_, are (if any repugnancie be) the greatest let
        or hinderance, that this _Chamælæa_ should not be it: but I
        leaue the discussing of these and others of the like nature, to
        our learned Physitians; for I deale not so much with vertues
        as with descriptions. The second is called of Lobel _Chamælæa
        Alpine incana_, of Clusius _Chamælæa secunda_, and saith hee
        had it out of Italy. Wee may call it in English, Mountaine
        Spurge Oliue, as it is in the description, or Mountaine
        Laurell, which you will. The last hath the name of _Cneorum_,
        first giuen it by Matthiolus, which since is continued by all
        others. Bauhinus (as I said) referreth it to the Mountaine
        Campions, but Clusius (as I doe) to the kindes of _Chamælæa_
        or _Thymælæa_. For want of an English name I haue (as you see,
        and that is according to the name the Germane women, as Clusius
        saith, doe call it) entituled it the Small Rocke Rose; which
        may abide vntill a fitter may be conferred vpon it.

        The Vertues.

CHAP. CIIIA.

_Laurus._   The Bay Tree.


My meaning is not to make any description of our ordinary Bayes in
this place (for as all may very well know, they may be for an Orchard
or Courtyard, and not for this Garden) but of two or three other
kindes, whose beautifull aspect haue caused them to be worthy of a
place therein: the one is called _Laurus Tinus_, The wilde Baye: the
other _Laurus Rosea_ or _Oleander_, The Rose Bay: and a third is
_Laurocerasus_, The Cherry Bay; which may haue not onely some respect
for his long bush of sweet smelling flowers, but especially for the
comely statelinesse of his gallant euer fresh greene leaues; and the
rather, because with vs in most places, it doth but _frutescere_, vse
to bee Shrub high, not _arborescere_, Tree high, which is the more fit
for this Garden.


1. _Laurus Tinus siue siluestris._   The wilde Bay tree.

This wilde Baye groweth seldome to bee a tree of any height, but
abideth for the most part low, shooting forth diuers slender branches,
whereon at euery ioynt stand two leaues, long, smooth, and of a darke
greene colour, somewhat like vnto the leaues of the Female Cornell
tree, or between that and Baye leaues: at the toppes of the branches
stand many small white sweete smelling flowers, thrusting together, as
it were in an vmbell or tuft, consisting of fiue leaues a peece, the
edges whereof haue a shew of a wash purple, or light blush in them,
which for the most part fall away without bearing any perfect ripe
fruit in our Countrey: Yet sometimes it hath small black berries, as if
they were good, but are not. In his naturall place it beareth small,
round, hard and pointed berries, of a shining blacke colour, for such
haue come often to my hands (yet Clusius writeth they are blew); but
I could neuer see any spring that I put into the ground. This that I
here describe, seemeth to me to be neither of both those that Clusius
saw growing in Spain and Portugall, but that other, that (as he saith)
sprang in the low Countreyes of Italian seede.


2. _Laurus Rosea siue Oleander._   The Rose Bay.

Of the Rose Bay there are two sorts, one bearing crimson coloured
flowers, which is more frequent, and the other white, which is more
rare. They are so like in all other things, that they neede but one
description for both. The stemme or trunke is many times with vs, as
bigge at the bottome as a good mans thumbe, but growing vp smaller,
it diuideth it selfe into branches, three for the most part comming
from one ioynt or place, and those branches againe doe likewise diuide
themselues into three other, and so by degrees from three to three,
as long as it groweth: the lowest of these are bare of leaues, hauing
shed or lost them by the cold of winters, keeping onely leaues on
the vppermost branches, which are long, and somewhat narrow, like in
forme vnto Peach leaues, but thicker, harder, and of a darke greene
colour on the vpperside, and yellowish greene vnderneath: at the tops
of the young branches come forth the flowers, which in the one sort
before they are open, are of an excellent bright crimson colour, and
being blowen, consist of foure long and narrow leaues, round pointed,
somewhat twining themselues, of a paler red colour, almost tending
to blush, and in the other are white, the greene leaues also being
of a little fresher colour: after the flowers are past, in the hot
countries, but neuer in ours, there come vp long bending or crooked
flat pods, whose outward shell is hard, almost woody, and of a browne
colour, wherein is contained small flat brownish seede, wrapped in
a great deale of a brownish yellow doune, as fine almost as silke,
somewhat like vnto the huskes of _Asclepias_, or _Periploca_, but
larger, flatter and harder; as my selfe can testifie, who had some of
the pods of this Rose bay, brought mee out of Spaine, by Master Doctor
Iohn More, the seedes whereof I sowed, and had diuers plants that I
raised vp vnto a reasonable height, but they require, as well old as
young, to bee defended from the colde of our winters.


3. _Laurocerasus._   The Bay Cherry.

This beautifull bay in his naturall place of growing, groweth to bee a
tree of a reasonable bignesse and height, and oftentimes with vs also
if it bee pruined from the lower branches; but more vsually in these
colder Countries, it groweth as a shrub or hedge bush, shooting forth
many branches, whereof the greater and lower are couered with a darke
grayish greene barke, but the young ones are very greene, whereon are
set many goodly, faire, large, thicke and long leaues, a little dented
about the edges, of a more excellent fresh shining greene colour, and
farre larger then any Bay leafe, and compared by many to the leaues of
the _Pomeritron_ tree (which because wee haue none in our Countrey,
cannot be so well known) both for colour and largenesse, which yeeld a
most gracefull aspect: it beareth long stalkes of whitish flowers, at
the ioynts of the leaues both along the branches and towards the ends
of them also, like vnto the Birds Cherry or _Padus Theophrasti_, which
the French men call _Putier & Cerisier blanc_, but larger and greater,
consisting of fiue leaues with many threds in the middle: after which
commeth the fruite or berries, as large or great as Flanders Cherries,
many growing together one by another on a long stalke, as the flowers
did, which are very blacke and shining on the outside, with a little
point at the end, and reasonable sweete in taste, wherein is contained
a hard round stone, very like vnto a Cherry stone, as I haue obserued
as well by those I receiued out of Italie, as by them I had of Master
Iames Cole a Merchant of London lately deceased, which grew at his
house in Highgate, where there is a faire tree which hee defended from
the bitternesse of the weather in winter by casting a blanket ouer the
toppe thereof euery yeare, thereby the better to preserue it.


        The Place.

        The first is not certainly knowne from whence it came, and is
        communicated by the suckers it yeeldeth. The second groweth in
        Spaine, Italie, Grece, and many other places: that with white
        flowers is recorded by Bellonius, to grow in Candy. The last,
        as Matthiolus, and after him Clusius report, came first from
        Constantinople: I had a plant hereof by the friendly gift of
        Master Iames Cole, the Merchant before remembred, a great louer
        of all rarities, who had it growing with him at his countrey
        house in Highgate aforesaid, where it hath flowred diuers
        times, and borne ripe fruit also.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth many times in the end of the yeare before
        Christmas, and often also in Ianuary, but the most kindly time
        is in March and Aprill, when the flowers are sweetest. The
        second flowreth not vntill Iuly. The last in May, and the fruit
        is ripe in August and September.


        The Names.

        The first is called _Laurus siluestris_, and _Laurus Tinus_: in
        English Wilde Bay, or Sweete flowring Bay. The second is called
        _Laurus Rosea_, _Oleander_, _Nerium_, and _Rhododendros_:
        in English The Rose Bay, and Oleander. The last was sent by
        the name of _Trebezon Curmasi_, that is to say, _Dactylus
        Trapezuntina_, but not hauing any affinitie with any kinde of
        Bay. Bellonius as I thinke first named it _Laurocerasus_, and
        _Cerasus Trapezuntina_. Dalechampius thinketh it to bee _Lotus
        Aphricana_, but Clusius refuteth it. Those stones or kernels
        that were sent me out of Italie, came by the name of _Laurus
        Regia_, The Kings Bay. Wee may most properly call it according
        to the Latine name in the title, The Cherry bay, or Bay Cherry,
        because his leaues are like vnto Bay-leaues, and both flowers
        and fruit like vnto the Birdes Cherry or Cluster Cherry, for
        the manner of the growing; and therefore I might more fitly
        I confesse haue placed it in my Orchard among the sorts of
        Cherries: but the beautifulnesse of the plant caused mee rather
        to insert it here.


        The Vertues.

        The wilde Bay hath no propertie allotted vnto it in Physicke,
        but that it is not to be endured, the berries being chewed
        declare it to be so violent hot and choking. The Rose Bay is
        said by Dioscorides, to be death to all foure footed beasts,
        but contrariwise to man it is a remedie against the poison of
        Serpents, but especially if Rue bee added vnto it. The Cherry
        Bay is not knowne with vs to what physicke vse it may be
        applyed.

_Cerasus flore multiplici._   The Rose or double blossomd Cherry.
_Malus flore multiplici._   The double blossomd Apple tree. And
_Malus Persica flore multiplici._   The double blossomd Peach tree.


The beautifull shew of these three sorts of flowers, hath made me
to insert them into this garden, in that for their worthinesse I am
vnwilling to bee without them, although the rest of their kindes I haue
transferred into the Orchard, where among other fruit trees, they shall
be remembred: for all these here set downe, seldome or neuer beare any
fruite, and therefore more fit for a Garden of flowers, then an Orchard
of fruite.


_Cerasus flore pleno vel multiplici._
The Rose Cherry, or Double blossomd Cherry.

The double blossomed Cherry tree is of two sorts for the flower, but
not differing in any other part, from the ordinary English or Flanders
Cherry tree, growing in very like manner: the difference consisteth in
this, that the one of these two sorts hath white flowers lesse double,
that is, of two rowes or more of leaues, and the other more double, or
with more rowes of leaues, and besides I haue obserued in this greater
double blossomd Cherry, that some yeares most of the flowers haue had
another smaller and double flower, rising vp out of the middle of the
other, like as is to bee seene in the double English Crow-foote, and
double redde _Ranunculus_ or Crowfoote, before described: this I say
doth not happen euery yeare, but sometimes. Sometimes also these trees
will giue a few berries, here and there scattered, and that with lesse
double flowers more often, which are like vnto our English Cherries
both for taste and bignesse. These be very fit to be set by Arbours.

   5 _Periclymenum rectum._ Vpright Honisuckle.
]


_Malus flore multiplici._   The double blossomd Apple tree.

This double blossomd Apple tree is altogether like vnto our ordinary
Pippin tree in body, branch and leafe, the only difference is in the
flower, which is altogether whitish, sauing that the inner leaues
towards the middle are more reddish, but as double and thicke as our
double Damaske Roses, which fall away without bearing fruit.


_Malus Persica flore multiplici._   The double blossomd Peach tree.

This Peach tree for the manner of growing, is so like vnto an ordinary
Peach tree, that vntill you see it in blossome you can perceiue no
difference: the flower is of the same colour with the blossomes of the
Peach, but consisting of three or foure, or more rowes of leaues, which
fall often away likewise without bearing any fruite; but after it hath
abiden some yeares in a place doth forme into fruite, especially being
planted against a wall.


        The Place.

        Both the Cherry trees are frequent in many places of England,
        noursed for their pleasant flowers. The Apple is as yet a
        stranger. And the Peach, hath not been seen or knowne, long
        before the writing hereof.


        The Time.

        They all flower in April & May, which are the times of their
        other kinds.


        The Names.

        Their names are also sufficiently expressed to know them by.


        The Vertues.

        Cherries, Peaches and Apples, are recorded in our Orchard, and
        there you shall finde the properties of their fruit: for in
        that these beare none or very few, their blossomes are of most
        vse to grace and decke the persons of those that will weare or
        beare them.




CHAP. CV.

_Periclymenum._   Honysuckles.


The Honisuckle that groweth wilde in euery hedge, although it be very
sweete, yet doe I not bring into my garden, but let it rest in his owne
place, to serue their senses that trauell by it, or haue no garden. I
haue three other that furnish my Garden, one that is called double,
whose branches spreade far, and being very fit for an arbour will soone
couer it: the other two stand vpright, and spreade not any way far, yet
their flowers declaring them to be Honisuckles, but of lesse delight, I
consort them with the other.


_Periclymenum perfoliatum siue Italicum._   The double Honisuckle.

The truncke or body of the double Honisuckle, is oftentimes of the
bignesse of a good staffe, running out into many long spreading
branches, couered with a whitish barke, which had neede of some thing
to sustaine them, or else they will fall down to the ground (and
therefore it is vsually planted at an arbour, that it may run thereon,
or against a house wall, and fastened thereto in diuers places with
nailes) from whence spring forth at seuerall distances, and at the
ioynts, two leaues, being like in forme vnto the wilde Honisuckles, and
round pointed for the most part; these branches diuiding themselues
diuers wayes, haue at the toppes of them many flowers, set at certaine
distances one aboue another, with two greene leaues at euery place,
where the flowers doe stand, ioyned so close at the bottome, and so
round and hollow in the middle, that it seemeth like a hollow cuppe or
sawcer of flowers: the flowers stand round about the middle of these
cuppes or sawcers, being long, hollow, and of a whitish yellow colour,
with open mouthes dasht ouer with a light shew of purple, and some
threds within them, very sweet in smell, like both in forme and colour
vnto the common Honisuckles, but that these cuppes with the flowers
in them are two or three standing one aboue another (which make a far
better shew then the common, which come forth all at the heade of the
branches, without any greene leaues or cuppes vnder them) and therefore
these were called double Honisuckles.


_Periclymenum rectum fructu rubro._   Red Honisuckles.

This vpright Woodbinde hath a straight woody stemme, diuided into
seuerall branches, about three or foure foote high, couered with a very
thinne whitish barke, whereon stand two leaues together at the ioynts,
being lesser then the former, smooth and plaine, and a little pointed:
the flowers come forth vpon slender long footstalks at the ioynts where
the leaues stand, alwayes two set together, and neuer more, but seldome
one alone, which are much smaller then the former, but of the same
fashion, with a little button at the foote of the flower; the buds of
the flowers before they are open are very reddish, but being open are
not so red, but tending to a kinde of yellowish blush colour: after
which come in their places two small red berries, the one withered for
the most part, or at least smaller then the other, but (as Clusius
saith) in their naturall places they are both full and of one bignesse.


_Periclymenum rectum fructu cæruleo._   Blew berried Honisuckles.

This other vpright Woodbinde groweth vp as high as the former, or
rather somewhat higher, couered with a blackish rugged barke, chapping
in diuers places, the younger branches whereof are somewhat reddish,
and couered with an hoary doune: the leaues stand two together at the
ioints, somewhat larger then the former, and more whitish vnderneath:
the flowers are likewise two standing together, at the end of a slender
footestalke, of a pale yellowish colour when they are blowne, but more
reddish in the bud: the berries stand two together as the former, of
a darke blewish colour when they are fully ripe, and full of a red
liquour or iuice, of a pleasant taste, which doth not only dye the
hands of them that gather them, but serueth for a dying colour to the
inhabitants where they grow plentifully, wherein are contained many
flat seede: The roote is woody as the former is.


        The Place.

        The first groweth in Italie, Spaine, and Prouence of France,
        but not in the colder countreyes, vnlesse it be there planted,
        as is most frequent in our countrey. The others grow in
        Austria, and Stiria, as Clusius saith, and are entertained into
        their gardens onely that are curious.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth vsually in Aprill, the rest in May.


        The Names.

        The first is called _Periclymenum_, _Caprifolium perfoliatum_,
        and _Italicum_, as a difference from the common kinde: In
        English Double Woodbinde, or double Honisuckles. The others,
        as they are rare, and little knowne, so are their names also:
        yet according to their Latine, I haue giuen them English names.


        The Vertues.

        The double Honisuckle is as effectuall in all things, as the
        single wilde kinde, and besides, is an especiall good wound
        herbe for the head or other parts. I haue not knowne the
        vpright kindes vsed in Physicke.




CHAP. CVI.

_Iasminum siue Gelseminum._   Iasmine or Gesmine.


We haue but one sort of true Iasmine ordinarily in our Gardens
throughout the whole Land; but there is another greater sort, which
is farre more tender, brought out of Spaine, and will hardly endure
any long time with vs, vnlesse it be very carefully preserued. Wee
haue a third kinde called a yellow Iasmine, but differeth much from
their tribe in many notable points: but because the flowers haue some
likenesse with the flowers of the true Iasmine, it hath been vsually
called a Iasmine; and therefore I am content for this Garden to
conioyne them in one Chapter.


1. _Iasminum album._   The white Iasmine.

The white Iasmine hath many twiggy flexible greene branches, comming
forth of the sundry bigger boughes or stems, that rise from the roote,
which are couered with a grayish darke coloured barke, hauing a white
pith within it like the Elder, but not so much: the winged leaues stand
alwaies two together at the ioynts, being made of manie small and
pointed leaues, set on each side of a middle ribbe, six most vsually
on both sides, with one at the end, which is larger, more pointed then
any of the rest, and of a darke greene colour: at the toppes of the
young branches stand diuers flowers together, as it were in an vmbell
or tuft, each whereof standeth on a long greene stalke, comming out of
a small huske, being small, long, and hollow belowe, opening into fiue
white small, pointed leaues, of a very strong sweete smell, which fall
away without bearing any fruit at all, that euer I could learne in our
Country; but in the hot Countries where it is naturall, it is said to
beare flat fruit, like Lupines: the rootes spread farre and deepe, and
are long and hard to growe, vntill they haue taken strong hold in the
ground.


2. _Iasminum Catalonicum._   The Spanish Iasmine.

This Catalonia Iasmine groweth lower then the former, neuer rising
halfe so high, and hath slender long greene branches, rising from the
toppe of the wooddy stemme, with such like leaues set on them as the
former, but somewhat shorter and larger: the flowers also are like vnto
the former, and stand in the same manner at the end of the branches,
but are much larger, being of a blush colour before they are blowne,
and white with blush edges when they are open, exceeding sweete of
smell, more strong then the former.


3. _Iasminum luteum, siue Trifolium fruticans alijs Polemonium._
The yellow Iasmine.

This that is called the yellow Iasmine, hath many long slender twiggy
branches rising from the roote, greene at the first, and couered with a
darke grayish barke afterwards, whereon are set at certaine distances,
three small darke greene leaues together, the end leafe being alwaies
the biggest: at the ioynts where the leaues come forth, stand long
stalkes, bearing long hollow flowers, ending in fiue, and some in six
leaues, very like vnto the flowers of the first Iasmine, but yellow,
whereupon it is vsually called the Yellow Iasmine: after the flowers
are past, there come in their places round blacke shining berries, of
the bignesse of a great Pease, or bigger, full of a purplish iuyce,
which will dye ones fingers that bruise them but a little: the roote is
tough, and white, creeping farre about vnder the ground, shooting forth
plentifully, whereby it greatly encreaseth.


        The Place.

        The first is verily thought to haue been first brought to
        Spaine out of Syria, or thereabouts, and from Spaine to vs, and
        is to be seene very often, and in many of our Country Gardens.
        The second hath his breeding in Spaine also, but whether it be
        his originall place we know not, and is scarce yet made well
        acquainted with our English ayre. The third groweth plentifully
        about Mompelier, and will well abide in our London Gardens, and
        any where else.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth not vntill the end of Iuly. The second
        somewhat earlier. The third in Iuly also.


        The Names.

        The first is generally called _Iasminum album_, and _Gelseminum
        album_: In English, The white Iasmine. The second hath his
        name in his title, as much as may be said of it. The third
        hath been taken of some to be a _Cytisus_, others iudge it to
        be _Polemonium_, but the truest name is _Trifolium fruticans_,
        although many call it _Iasminum luteum_: In English most
        vsually, The yellow Iasmine, for the reasons aforesaid; or else
        after the Latine name, Shrubbie Trefoile, or Make-bate.


        The Vertues.

        The white Iasmines haue beene in all times accepted into
        outward medicines, eyther for the pleasure of the sweete sent,
        or profit of the warming properties. And is in these dayes
        onely vsed as an ornament in Gardens, or for sent of the
        flowers in the house, &c. The yellow Iasmine, although some
        haue adiudged it to be the _Polemonium_ of Dioscorides, yet it
        is not vsed to those purposes by any that I know.




CHAP. CVII.

_Syringa._   The Pipe tree.


Vnder the name of _Syringa_, is contained two speciall kinds of
Shrubs or Trees, differing one from another; namely, the _Lilac_ of
Matthiolus, which is called _Syringa cærulea_, and is of two or three
sorts: And the _Syringa alba_, which also is of two sorts, as shall bee
declared.


1. _Lilac siue Syringa cærulea._ The blew Pipe tree.

The blew Pipe tree riseth sometimes to be a great tree, as high and
bigge in the bodie as a reasonable Apple tree (as I haue in some places
seene and obserued) but most vsually groweth lower, with many twigs
or branches rising from the roote, hauing as much pith in the middle
of them as the Elder hath, couered with a grayish greene barke, but
darker in the elder branches, with ioynts set at a good distance one
from another, and two leaues at euery ioynt, which are large, broad,
and pointed at the ends, many of them turning or folding both the
sides inward, and standing on long foote stalkes: at the toppes of
the branches come forth many flowers, growing spike-fashion, that is,
a long branch of flowers vpon a stalke, each of these flowers are
small, long, and hollow belowe, ending aboue in a pale blewish flower,
consisting of foure small leaues, of a pretty small sent: after the
flowers are past, there come sometimes (but it is not often in our
Country, vnlesse the tree haue stood long, and is grown great, the
suckers being continually taken away, that it may growe the better)
long and flat cods, consisting as it were of two sides, a thin skinne
being in the midst, wherein are contained two long flattish red seede:
the rootes are strong, and growe deepe in the ground.


2. _Syringa flore lacteo siue argenteo._
The siluer coloured Pipe tree.

This Pipe tree differeth not from the former blew Pipe tree, either in
stemme or branches, either in leaues or flowers, or manner of growing,
but onely in the colour of the flower, which in this is of a milke, or
siluer colour, which is a kinde of white, wherein there is a thinne
wash, or light shew of blew shed therein, comming somewhat neare vnto
an ash-colour.


3. _Lilac lacimatis folijs._   The blew Pipe tree with cut leaues.

This Pipe tree should not differ from the first in any other thing then
in the leaues, which are said to be cut in on the edges into seuerall
parts, as the relation is giuen _à viris fide dignis_; for as yet I
neuer saw any such; but I here am bold to set it downe, to induce and
prouoke some louer of plants to obtaine it for his pleasure, and others
also.


4. _Syringa flore albo simplici._   The single white Pipe tree.

The single white Pipe tree or bush, neuer commeth to that height of the
former, but abideth alwaies like a hedge tree or bush, full of shootes
or suckers from the roote, much more then the former: the young shootes
hereof are reddish on the outside, and afterward reddish at the ioynts,
and grayish all the rest ouer: the young as well as the old branches,
haue some pith in the middle of them, like as the Elder hath: the
leaues stand two at a ioynt, somewhat like the former, but more rugged
or crumpled, as also a little pointed, and dented about the edges: the
flowers growe at the toppes of the branches, diuers standing together,
consisting of foure white leaues, like vnto small Muske Roses, and of
the same creame colour, as I may call it, with many small yellowish
threads in the middle, and are of a strong, full, or heady sent, not
pleasing to a great many, by reason of the strange quicknesse of the
sent: the fruit followeth, being flat at the head, with many leafie
shels or scales compassing it, wherein is enclosed small long seede:
the rootes runne not deepe, but spread vnder the ground, with many
fibres annexed vnto them.


5. _Syringa Arabica flore albo duplici._   The double white Pipe tree.

This Pipe tree hath diuers long and slender branches, whereon growe
large leaues, somewhat like vnto the leaues of the former single white
kinde, but not so rough or hard, and not at all dented about the edges,
two alwaies standing one against another at euery ioynt of the stalke,
but set or disposed on contrary sides, and not all vpon one side; at
the ends whereof come forth diuers flowers, euery one standing on his
owne foote-stalke, the hose or huske being long and hollow, like vnto
the white Iasmine, and the flowers therein consisting of a double rowe
of white and round pointed leaues, fiue or six in a rowe, with some
yellownesse in the middle, which is hollow, of a very strong and heady
sweet sent, and abiding a long time flowring, especially in the hotter
Countries, but is very tender, and not able to abide any the least cold
weather with vs; for the cold windes will (as I vnderstand) greatly
molest it: and therefore must as charily be kept as Orenge trees with
vs, if wee will haue it to abide.


[Illustration:

   1 _Iasminum album vulgare._ The ordinary white Iasmine.
   2 _Iasminum Americanum siue Convolvulus Americanus._ The Iasmine or
        Bindweed of America.
   3 _Iasminum luteum vulgare._ The yellow Iasmine.
   4 _Lilac seu Syringa cærulea._ The blew Pipe tree.
   5 _Syringa alba vulgaris._ The single white Syringa or Pipe tree.
   6 _Syringa flore albo duplici._ The double white Syringa.
   7 _Sambucus rosea._ The Elder or Gelder Rose.
]


        The Place.

        The first groweth in Arabia (as Matthiolus thinketh, that had
        it from Constantinople.) We haue it plentifully in our Gardens.
        The second and third are strangers with vs as yet. The fourth
        is as frequent as the first, or rather more, but his originall
        is not knowne. The last hath his originall from Arabia, as his
        name importeth.


        The Time.

        The first, second, and third flower in Aprill, the other two
        not vntill May.


        The Names.

        The first is called of Matthiolus _Lilac_, and by that name is
        most vsually called in all parts. It is also called _Syringa
        cærulea_, because it commeth nearest vnto those woods, which
        for their pithy substance, were made hollow into pipes. It
        is called of all in English, The blew Pipe tree. It seemeth
        likely, that Petrus Bellonius in his third Booke and fiftieth
        Chapter of his obseruations (making mention of a shrubbe that
        the Turkes haue, with Iuie leaues alwaies greene, bearing
        blew or violet coloured flowers on a long stalke, of the
        bignesse and fashion of a Foxe taile, and thereupon called
        in their language a Foxe taile) doth vnderstand this plant
        here expressed. The certainty whereof might easily be knowne,
        if any of our Merchants there residing, would but call for
        such a shrubbe, by the name of a Foxe taile in the Turkish
        tongue, and take care to send a young roote, in a small tubbe
        or basket with earth by Sea, vnto vs here at London, which
        would be performed with a very little paines and cost. The
        second and third, as kindes thereof, haue their names in their
        titles. The fourth is called by Clusius and others, _Frutex
        Coronarius_; some doe call it _Lilac flore albo_, but that name
        is not proper, in that it doth confound both kindes together.
        Lobel calleth it _Syringa Italica_. It is now generally called
        of all _Syringa alba_, that is in English, The white Pipe
        tree. Some would haue it to bee _Ostrys_ of Theophrastus,
        but Clusius hath sufficiently cleared that doubt. Of others
        _Ligustrum Orientale_, which it cannot be neither; for the
        _Cyprus_ of Plinie is Dioscorides his _Ligustrum_, which
        may be called _Orientale_, in that it is most proper to the
        Easterne Countries, and is very sweete, whose seede is like
        vnto Coriander seede. The last is called by diuers _Syringa
        Arabica flore albo duplici_, as most fitly agreeing thereunto.
        Of Basilius Beslerus that set forth the great booke of the
        Bishop of Eystot in Germany his Garden, _Syringa Italica
        flore albo pleno_, because, as it is likely, hee had it from
        Italy. It is very likely, that Prosper Alpinus in his booke of
        Egyptian plants, doth meane this plant, which hee there calleth
        _Sambach, siue Iasminum Arabicum_. Matthæus Caccini of Florence
        in his letter to Clusius entituleth it _Syringa Arabica,
        siue Iasminum Arabicum, siue Iasminum ex Gine_, whereby hee
        declareth that it may not vnfitly be referred to either of them
        both. We may call it in English as it is in the title, The
        double white Pipe tree.


        The Vertues.

        We haue no vse of these in Physicke that I know, although
        Prosper Alpinus saith, the double white Pipe tree is much vsed

_Sambucus Rosea._   The Elder or Gelder Rose.


Although there be diuers kindes of Elders, yet there is but one kinde
of Elder Rose, whereof I meane to intreate in this Chapter, being of
neare affinity in some things vnto the former Pipe trees, and which
for the beauty of it deserueth to be remembred among the delights of a
Garden.


_Sambucus Rosea._   The Gelder Rose.

The Gelder Rose (as it is called) groweth to a reasonable height,
standing like a tree, with a trunke as bigge as any mans arme, couered
with a darke grayish barke, somewhat rugged and very knotty: the
younger branches are smooth and white, with a pithy substance in the
middle, as the Elders haue, to shew that it is a kind thereof, whereon
are set broad leaues, diuided into three parts or diuisions, somewhat
like vnto a Vine leafe, but smaller, and more rugged or crumpled,
iagged or cut also about the edges: at the toppes of euery one of the
young branches, most vsually commeth forth a great tuft, or ball as it
were, of many white flowers, set so close together, that there can be
no distinction of any seuerall flower seene, nor doth it seeme like
the double flower of any other plant, that hath many rowes of leaues
set together, but is a cluster of white leaued flowers set together
vpon the stalke that vpholdeth them, of a small sent, which fall away
without bearing any fruit in our Country, that euer I could obserue
or learne: The roote spreadeth neither farre nor deepe, but shooteth
many small rootes and fibres, whereby it is fastened in the ground, and
draweth nourishment to it, and sometimes yeeldeth suckers from it.


        The Place.

        It should seeme, that the naturall place of this Elder is wet
        and moist grounds, because it is so like vnto the Marsh Elder,
        which is the single kind hereof. It is onely noursed vp in
        Gardens in all our Country.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in May, much about the time of the double Peony
        flower, both which being set together, make a pleasant variety,
        to decke vp the windowes of a house.


        The Names.

        It is generally called _Sambucus Rosea_: In English, The Elder
        Rose, and more commonly after the Dutch name, the Gelder Rose.
        Dalechampius seemeth to make it _Thraupalus_ of Theophrastus,
        or rather the single Marsh Elder; for I thinke this double
        kinde was not knowne in Theophrastus his time.


        The Vertues.

        It is not applyed to any Physicall vse that I know.




CHAP. CIX.

_Rosa._   The Rose tree or bush.


The great varietie of Roses is much to be admired, beeing more then
is to bee seene in any other shrubby plant that I know, both for
colour, forme and smell. I haue to furnish this garden thirty sorts
at the least, euery one notably differing from the other, and all fit
to be here entertained: for there are some other, that being wilde
and of no beautie or smell, we forbeare, and leaue to their wilde
habitations. To distinguish them by their colours, as white, red,
incarnate, and yellow, were a way that many might take, but I hold
it not so conuenient for diuers respects: for so I should confound
those of diuers sorts one among another, and I should not keepe that
methode which to me seemeth most conuenient, which is, to place and
ranke euery kinde, whether single or double, one next vnto the other,
that so you may the better vnderstand their varieties and differences:
I will therefore beginne with the most ancient, and knowne Roses to
our Countrey, whether naturall or no I know not, but assumed by our
precedent Kings of all others, to bee cognisances of their dignitie,
the white Rose and the red, whom shall follow the damaske, of the
finest sent, and most vse of all the other sorts, and the rest in their
order.


1. _Rosa Anglica alba._   The English white Rose.

The white Rose is of two kindes, the one more thicke and double then
the other: The one riseth vp in some shadowie places, vnto eight or ten
foote high, with a stocke of a great bignesse for a Rose. The other
growing seldome higher then a Damaske Rose. Some doe iudge both these
to be but one kinde, the diuersitie happening by the ayre, or ground,
or both. Both these Roses haue somewhat smaller and whiter greene
leaues then in many other Roses, fiue most vsually set on a stalke,
and more white vnderneath, as also a whiter greene barke, armed with
sharpe thornes or prickles, whereby they are soone known from other
Roses, although the one not so easily from the other: the flowers in
the one are whitish, with an eye or shew of a blush, especially towards
the ground or bottome of the flower, very thicke double, and close
set together, and for the most part not opening it selfe so largely
and fully as eyther the Red or Damaske Rose. The other more white,
lesse thicke and double, and opening it selfe more, and some so little
double as but of two or three rowes, that they might be held to be
single, yet all of little or no smell at all. To describe you all the
seuerall parts of the Rose, as the bud, the beards, the threds &c. were
needlesse, they are so conuersant in euery ones hand, that I shall not
neede but to touch the most speciall parts of the varieties of them,
and leaue a more exact relation of all things incident vnto them, vnto
a generall worke.


2. _Rosa Incarnata._   The Carnation Rose.

The Carnation Rose is in most things like vnto the lesser white rose,
both for the growing of the stocke, and bignesse of the flower, but
that it is more spreade abroade when it is blown then the white is, and
is of a pale blush colour all the flower thoroughout, of as small a
sent as the white one is almost.

[Sidenote: _Rosa Belgica siue Vitrea._]

This kinde of Rose is not very great, but very thicke and double, and
is very variable in the flowers, in that they will be so different
one from another: some being paler then others, and some as it were
blasted, which commeth not casually, but naturally to this rose: but
the best flowers (whereof there will bee still some) will be of a
bright pale murrey colour, neere vnto the Veluet rose, but nothing so
darke a colour.


3. _Rosa Anglica rubra._   The English red Rose.

The red Rose (which I call English not only for the reason before
expressed, but because (as I take it) this Rose is more frequent and
vsed in England, then in other places) neuer groweth so high as the
damaske Rose bush, but most vsually abideth low, and shooteth forth
many branches from the roote (and is but seldome suffered to grow vp as
the damaske Rose into standards) with a greene barke, thinner set with
prickles, and larger and greener leaues on the vpperside then in the
white, yet with an eye of white vpon them, fiue likewise most vsually
set vpon a stalke, and grayish or whitish vnderneath. The Roses or
Flowers doe very much vary, according to their site and abiding; for
some are of an orient, red or deepe crimson colour, and very double
(although neuer so double as the white) which when it is full blowne
hath the largest leaues of any other Rose; some of them againe are
paler, tending somewhat to a damaske; and some are of so pale a red,
as that it is rather of the colour of the canker Rose, yet all for
the most part with larger leaues then the damaske, and with many more
yellow threds in the middle: the sent hereof is much better then in the
white, but not comparable to the excellencie of the damaske Rose, yet
this Rose being well dryed and well kept, will hold both colour and
sent longer then the damaske, bee it neuer so well kept.


4. _Rosa Damascena._   The Damaske Rose.

The Damaske Rose bush is more vsually noursed vp to a competent height
to stand alone, (which we call Standards) then any other Rose: the
barke both of the stocke and branches, is not fully so greene as the
red or white Rose: the leaues are greene with an eye of white vpon
them, so like vnto the red Rose, that there is no great difference
betweene them, but that the leaues of the red Rose seeme to bee of a
darker greene. The flowers are of a fine deepe blush colour, as all
know, with some pale yellow threds in the middle, and are not so thicke
and double as the white, not being blowne, with so large and great
leaues as the red, but of the most excellent sweet pleasant sent, far
surpassing all other Roses or Flowers, being neyther heady nor too
strong, nor stuffing or vnpleasant sweet, as many other flowers.


5. _Rosa Prouincialis siue Hollandica Damascena._
The great double Damaske Prouince or Holland Rose.

This Rose (that some call _Centifolia Batauica incarnata_) hath his
barke of a reddish or browne colour, whereby it is soone discerned from
other Roses. The leaues are likewise more reddish then in others, and
somewhat larger, it vsually groweth very like the Damaske rose, and
much to the same height: the flowers or roses are of the same deepe
blush colour that the damaske roses are, or rather somewhat deeper,
but much thicker, broader, and more double, or fuller of leaues by
three parts almost, the outer leaues turning themselues backe, when the
flower hath stood long blowne, the middle part it selfe (which in all
other roses almost haue some yellow threds in them to be seene) being
folded hard with small leaues, without any yellow almost at all to be
seene, the sent whereof commeth neerest vnto the damaske rose, but yet
is short of it by much, howsoeuer many doe thinke it as good as the
damask, and to that end I haue known some Gentlewomen haue caused all
their damaske stockes to bee grafted with prouince Roses, hoping to
haue as good water, and more store of them then of damask Roses; but in
my opinion it is not of halfe so good a sent as the water of damaske
Roses: let euery one follow their own fancie.


6. _Rosa Prouincialis rubra._   The red Prouince Rose.

As the former was called _incarnata_, so this is called _Batauica
centifolia rubra_, the difference being not very great: the stemme or
stocke, and the branches also in this, seeming not to be so great but
greener, the barke being not so red; the leaues of the same largenesse
with the former damaske Prouince. The flowers are not altogether so
large, thicke and double, and of a little deeper damaske or blush
colour, turning to a red Rose, but not comming neere the full colour
of the best red Rose, of a sent not so sweete as the damaske Prouince,
but comming somewhat neere the sent of the ordinary red rose, yet
exceeding it. This rose is not so plentifull in bearing as the damaske
Prouince.


7. _Rosa Prouincialis alba._   The white Prouince Rose.

It is said of diuers, that there is a white Prouince Rose, whereof I
am not _oculatus testis_, and therefore I dare not giue it you for
a certaintie, and indeed I haue some doubt, that it is the greater
and more double white rose, whereof I gaue you the knowledge in the
beginning: when I am my selfe better satisfied, I shall bee ready to
satisfie others.


8. _Rosa versicolor._
The party coloured Rose, of some Yorke and Lancaster.

This Rose in the forme and order of the growing, is neerest vnto the
ordinary damaske rose, both for stemme, branch, leafe and flower: the
difference consisting in this, that the flower (being of the same
largenesse and doublenesse as the damask rose) hath the one halfe of
it, sometimes of a pale whitish colour, and the other halfe, of a paler
damaske colour then the ordinary; this happeneth so many times, and
sometimes also the flower hath diuers stripes, and markes in it, as
one leafe white, or striped with white, and the other halfe blush, or
striped with blush, sometimes also all striped, or spotted ouer, and
other times little or no stripes or markes at all, as nature listeth
to play with varieties, in this as in other flowers: yet this I haue
obserued, that the longer it abideth blowen open in the sun, the paler
and the fewer stripes, markes or spots will be seene in it: the smell
whereof is of a weake damaske rose sent.


9. _Rosea Chrystallina._   The Chrystall Rose.

This Rose is very like vnto the last described, both for stocke, branch
and leafe: the flower hereof is not much different from it, being no
great large or double Rose, but of a meane size, striped and marked
with a deeper blush or red, vpon the pale coloured leafe, that it
seemeth in the marking and beauty thereof, to bee of as much delight as
the Chrystall Gilloflower: this, euen like the former, soone fadeth and
passeth away, not yeelding any great store of flowers any yeare.


10. _Rosa rubra humilis siue pumilio._
The dwarfe red Rose, or Gilloflower Rose.

This Rose groweth alwayes low and small, otherwise in most respects
like vnto the ordinary redde Rose, and with few or no thornes vpon
it: the Flowers or Roses are double, thicke, small and close, not so
much spread open as the ordinary red, but somewhat like vnto the first
double white Rose before expressed; yet in some places I haue seene
them more layde open then these, as they grew in my garden, being so
euen at the toppes of the leaues, as if they had been clipt off with
a paire of sheeres, and are not fully of so red a colour as the red
Prouince Rose, and of as small or weak sent as the ordinary red Rose,
or not so much.


11. _Rosa Francafurtensis._   The Franckford Rose.

The young shootes of this Rose are couered with a pale purplish barke,
set with a number of small prickes like haires, and the elder haue but
very few thornes: the flower or rose it selfe hath a very great bud or
button vnder it, more then in any other rose, and is thicke and double
as a red rose, but so strongly swelling in the bud, that many of them
breake before they can be full blowen, and then they are of a pale red
rose colour, that is, betweene a red and a damaske, with a very thicke
broade and hard vmbone of short yellow threds or thrumes in the middle,
the huske of the flower hauing long ends, which are called the beards
of the rose, which in all other are iagged in some of them, in this
hath no iagge at all; the smell is neerest vnto a red Rose.

[Illustration:

   1 _Rosa Damascena._ The Damaske Rose.
   2 _Rosa Prouincialis siue Hollandica._ The great Prouince Rose.
   3 _Rosa Francafurtensis._ The Franckford Rose.
   4 _Rosa rubra humilis._ The dwarfe red Rose.
   5 _Rosa Hungarica._ The Hungarian Rose.
   6 _Rosa lutea multiplex._ The great double yellow Rose.
]


12. _Rosa Hungarica._   The Hungarian Rose.

The Hungarian Rose hath greene shootes slenderly set with prickes, and
seldome groweth higher then ordinarily the red Rose doth; the stemme or
stocke being much about that bignesse: the flower or rose is as great,
thicke and double, as the ordinary red Rose, and of the same fashion,
of a paler red colour, and beeing neerely looked vpon is finely spotted
with faint spots, as it were spreade ouer the red; the smell wherof is
somewhat better then the smell of the ordinary red Rose of the best
kinde.


13. _Rosa Holoserica simplex & multiplex._
The Veluet Rose single and double.

The old stemme or stock of the veluet Rose is couered with a dark
coloured barke, and the young shootes of a sad greene with very few or
no thornes at all vpon them: the leaues are of a sadder greene colour
then in most sorts of Roses, and very often seuen on a stalke, many
of the rest hauing but fiue: the Rose is eyther single or double: the
single is a broade spread flower, consisting of fiue or sixe broade
leaues with many yellow threds in the middle: the double hath two
rowes of leaues, the one large, which are outermost, the other smaller
within, of a very deepe red crimson colour like vnto crimson veluet,
with many yellow threds also in the middle; and yet for all the double
rowe of leaues, these Roses stand but like single flowers: but there
is another double kinde that is more double then this last, consisting
oftentimes of sixteene leaues or more in a flower, and most of them
of an equall bignesse, of the colour of the first single rose of this
kinde, or somewhat fresher; but all of them of a smaller sent then the
ordinary red Rose.


14. _Rosa siue spinis simplex & multiplex._
The Rose without thornes single and double.

The Rose without thornes hath diuers greene smooth shootes, rising
from the root, without any pricke or thorne at all vpon them, eyther
young or old: the leaues are not fully so large as of the red rose: the
flowers or roses are not much bigger then those of the double Cinamon
Rose, thicke set together and short, of a pale red Rose colour, with
diuers pale coloured veines through euery leafe of the flower, which
hath caused some to call it The marbled Rose, and is of a small sent,
not fully equall to the red Rose. The single of this kinde differeth
not in any other thing from the former, then in the doublenesse or
singlenesse of the flowers which in this are not halfe so double, nor
yet fully single, and are of a paler red colour.

[Sidenote: _Rosa siue spina flore albo._]

I haue heard likewise of a white Rose of this kinde, but I haue seene
none such as yet, therefore I can say no more thereof.


15. _Rosa Cinamomea simplex & multiplex._
The Cinamon Rose single and double.

The single Cinamon Rose hath his shootes somewhat red, yet not so red
as the double kinde, armed with great thornes, like almost vnto the
Eglantine bush thereby showing, as well by the multiplicitie of his
shootes as the quicknesse and height of his shooting, his wilde nature:
On the stemme and branches stand winged leaues, sometimes seuen or more
together, which are small and greene, yet like vnto other Roses. The
Roses are single, of fiue leaues a peece, somewhat large, and of a pale
red colour, like vnto the double kinde, which is in shootes redder, and
in all other things like vnto the single, but bearing small, short,
thicke and double Roses, somewhat like vnto the Rose without thornes,
but a little lesser, of a paler red colour at the end of the leaues,
and somewhat redder and brighter toward the middle of them, with many
yellow short thrumes; the small sent of Cinamon that is found in the
flowers hath caused it to beare the name.


16. _Rosa lutea simplex._   The single yellow Rose.

This single yellow Rose is planted rather for variety then any other
good vse. It often groweth to a good height, his stemme being great and
wooddy, with few or no prickes vpon the old wood, but with a number of
small prickes like haires, thicke set, vpon the younger branches, of a
darke colour somewhat reddish, the barke of the young shootes being of
a sad greene reddish colour: the leaues of this Rose bush are smaller,
rounder pointed, of a paler greene colour, yet finely snipt about the
edges, and more in number, that is, seuen or nine on a stalke or ribbe,
then in any other Garden kinde, except the double of the same kinde
that followeth next: the flower is a small single Rose, consisting
of fiue leaues, not so large as the single Spanish Muske Rose, but
somewhat bigger then the Eglantine or sweete Briar Rose, of a fine pale
yellow colour, without any great sent at all while it is fresh, but a
little more, yet small and weake when it is dryed.


17. _Rosa lutea multiplex siue flore pleno._   The double yellow Rose.

The double yellow Rose is of great account, both for the rarity, and
doublenesse of the flower, and had it sent to the rest, would of all
other be of highest esteeme. The stemme or stocke, the young shoots or
branches, the small hairy prickes, and the small winged leaues, are in
all parts like vnto the former single kinde; the chiefest difference
consisteth in the doublenesse of the flower or Rose, which is so thicke
and double, that very often it breaketh out on one side or another,
and but a few of them abiding whole and faire in our Countrey, the
cause whereof wee doe imagine to bee the much moisture of our Countrey,
and the time of flowring being subiect to much raine and showers;
many therefore doe either plant it against a wall, or other wayes
defend it by couering: againe, it is so plentifull in young shootes or
branches, as also in flowers at the toppe or euery branch, which are
small and weake for the most part, that they are not able to bring all
the flowers to ripenesse; and therefore most of them fall or wither
away without comming to perfection (the remedy that many doe vse for
this inconuenience last recited is, that they nippe away most of the
buds, leauing but some few vpon it, that so the vigour of the plant
may be collected into a few flowers, whereby they may the better come
to perfection, and yet euen thus it is hardly effected) which are of
a yellowish greene colour in the bud, and before they be blowne open,
but then are of a faire yellow colour, very full of leaues, with many
short haires rather then leaues in the middle, and hauing short, round,
greene, smooth buttons, almost flat vnder them: the flower being faire
blowne open, doth scarce giue place for largenesse, thicknesse, and
doublenesse, vnto the great Prouence or Holland Rose. This Rose bush or
plant is very tender with vs here about London, and will require some
more care and keeping then the single of this kinde, which is hardy
enough; for I haue lost many my selfe, and I know but a few about this
towne that can nourse it vp kindly, to beare or scarce to abide without
perishing; but abideth well in euery free aire of all or the most parts
of this Kingdome: but (as I heare) not so well in the North.


18. _Rosa Moschata simplex & multiplex._
The Muske Rose single and double.

The Muske Rose both single and double, rise vp oftentimes to a very
great height, that it ouergroweth any arbour in a Garden, or being set
by an house side, to bee ten or twelue foote high, or more, but more
especially the single kinde, with many green farre spread branches,
armed with a few sharpe great thornes, as the wilder sorts of Roses
are, whereof these are accounted to be kindes, hauing small darke
greene leaues on them, not much bigger then the leaues of Eglantine:
the flowers come forth at the toppes of the branches, many together
as it were in an vmbell or tuft which for the most part doe flower
all at a time, or not long one after another, euery one standing on a
pretty long stalke, and are of a pale whitish or creame colour, both
the single and the double; the single being small flowers, consisting
of fiue leaues, with many yellow threads in the middle: and the double
bearing more double flowers, as if they were once or twice more double
then the single, with yellow thrummes also in the middle, both of them
of a very sweete and pleasing smell, resembling Muske: some there be
that haue auouched, that the chiefest sent of these Roses consisteth
not in the leaues, but in the threads of the flowers.


19. _Rosa Moschata multiplex altera: alijs Damascena alba, vel
verisimilior Cinamomea flore pleno albo._
The double white Damaske Muske Rose.

This other kinde of Muske Rose (which with some is called the white
Damaske Muske, but more truely the double white Cinamon Rose) hath
his stemme and branches also shorter then the former, but as greene:
the leaues are somewhat larger, and of a whiter greene colour; the
flowers also are somewhat larger then the former double kinde, but
standing in vmbels after the same manner, or somewhat thicker, and of
the same whitish colour, or a little whiter, and somewhat, although but
a little, neare the smell of the other, but nothing so strong. This
flowreth at the time of other Roses, or somewhat later, yet much before
the former two sorts of Muske Roses, which flower not vntill the end
of Summer, and in Autumne; both which things, that is, the time of the
flowring, and the sent being both different, shew plainly it cannot be
of the tribe of the Muske Roses.


20. _Rosa Hispanica Moschata simplex._   The Spanish Muske Rose.

This Spanish Rose riseth to the height of the Eglantine, and sometimes
higher, with diuers great greene branches, the leaues whereof are
larger and greener then of the former kindes: the flowers are single
Roses, consisting of fiue whiter leaues then in any of the former Muske
Roses, and much larger, hauing sometimes an eye of a blush in the
white, of a very sweete smell, comming nearest vnto the last recited
Muske Rose, as also for the time of the flowring.


21. _Rosa Pomifera maior._   The great Apple Rose.

The stemme or stocke of this Rose is great, couered with a darke
grayish barke, but the younger branches are somewhat reddish, armed
here and there with great and sharpe thornes, but nothing so great
or plentifull as in the Eglantine, although it be a wilde kinde: the
leaues are of a whitish greene colour, almost like vnto the first white
Rose, and fiue alwaies set together, but seldome seuen: the flowers
are small and single, consisting of fiue leaues, without any sent, or
very little, and little bigger then those of the Eglantine bush, and of
the very same deepe blush colour, euery one standing vpon a rough or
prickly button, bearded in the manner of other Roses, which when the
flowers are fallen growe great, somewhat long and round, peare-fashion,
bearing the beards on the tops of them; and being full ripe are very
red, keeping the small prickles still on them, wherein are many white,
hard, and roundish seedes, very like vnto the seede of the Heppes or
Eglantine Berries, lying in a soft pulpe, like vnto the Hawthorne
berries or Hawes: the whole beauty of this plant consisteth more in the
gracefull aspect of the red apples or fruit hanging vpon the bushes,
then in the flowers, or any other thing. It seemeth to be the same that
Clusius calleth _Rosa Pumila_, but that with me it groweth much higher
and greater then he saith his doth.


22. _Rosa siluestris odora siue Eglenteria simplex._
The single Eglantine or sweete Briar bush.

The sweete Briar or Eglantine Rose is so well knowne, being not onely
planted in Gardens, for the sweetenesse of the leaues, but growing
wilde in many woods and hedges, that I thinke it lost time to describe
it; for that all know it hath exceeding long greene shootes, armed with
the cruellest sharpe and strong thornes, and thicker set then is in
any Rose either wilde or tame: the leaues are smaller then in most of
those that are noursed vp in Gardens, seuen or nine most vsually set
together on a ribbe or stalke, very greene and sweete in smell, aboue
the leaues of any other kinde of Rose: the flowers are small single
blush Roses, of little or no sent at all, which turne into reddish
berries, stuffed within with a dounie or flock matter or substance,
wherein doth lye white hard seede.

23. _Rosa siluestris odora siue Eglenteria flore duplici._
The double Eglantine.

The double Eglantine is in all the places that I haue seene it a
grafted Rose, (but I doubt not, but that his originall was naturall,
and that it may be made naturall againe, as diuers other Roses are.)
It groweth and spreadeth very well, and with a great head of branches,
whereon stand such like leaues as are in the single kinde, but a little
larger, not smelling fully so sweete as it: the flowers are somewhat
bigger then the single, but not much, hauing but one other rowe of
leaues onely more then the former, which are smaller, and the outer
leaues larger, but of the same pale reddish purple colour, and smelleth
somewhat better then the single.


24. _Rosa semper virens._   The euer greene Rose bush.

This Rose or bush is very like vnto a wilde single Eglantine bush in
many respects, hauing many very long greene branches, but more slender
and weake, so that many times they bend downe againe, not able to
sustaine themselues without some helpe, and armed with hooked thornes
as other Roses be; the winged leaues consist of seuen for the most
part, whereof those two that are lowest and opposite, are smallest, the
next two bigger then they, the third couple bigger then any of the rest
belowe, and the end leafe biggest of all: this proportion generally it
holdeth in euery winged leafe through the whole plant, which at the
first comming forth are somewhat reddish, with the young branch that
shooteth out with them, but being full growne, are of a deepe greene
colour, and somewhat shining, dented about the edges, and fall not away
from the branches as other Roses doe, but abide thereon for the most
part all the Winter: the flowers stand foure or fiue together at the
tops of the branches, being single Roses, made of fiue leaues a peece,
of a pure white colour, much larger then the ordinary Muske Rose, and
of a fine sent, comming nearest thereunto, with many yellow chiues or
threads in the middle.


        The Place.

        Some of these Roses had their originall, as is thought in
        England, as the first and second; for these dryed red Roses
        that come ouer to vs from beyond the Seas, are not of the kinde
        of our red Rose, as may well be perceiued by them that will
        compare our English dryed leaues with those. Some in Germany,
        Spaine, and Italy. Some againe in Turkie, as the double yellow
        Rose, which first was procured to be brought into England, by
        Master Nicholas Lete, a worthy Merchant of London, and a great
        louer of flowers, from Constantinople, which (as wee heare)
        was first brought thither from Syria; but perished quickly
        both with him, and with all other to whom hee imparted it:
        yet afterwards it was sent to Master Iohn de Franqueuille, a
        Merchant also of London, and a great louer of all rare plants,
        as well as flowers, from which is sprung the greatest store,
        that is now flourishing in this Kingdome.


        The Time.

        The Cinamon Rose is the earliest for the most part, which
        flowreth with vs about the middle of May, and sometimes in the
        beginning. The ordinary Muske Roses both single and double
        flower latest, as is said. All the other flower much about one
        time, in the beginning of Iune, or thereabouts, and continue
        flowring all that moneth, and the next throughout for the most
        part, and the red vntill August be halfe past.


        The Names.

        The seuerall names, whereby they are most commonly knowne vnto
        vs in this Countrey, are expressed in their titles; but they
        are much differing from what they are called in other Countries
        neare vnto vs, which to compare, conferre, and agree together,
        were a worke of more paines then vse: But to proportion them
        vnto the names set downe by Theophrastus, Pliny, and the rest
        of the ancient Authors, were a worke, wherein I might be
        sure not to escape without falling into errour, as I verily
        beleeue many others haue done, that haue vndertaken to doe
        it: I will therefore for this worke desire that you will rest
        contented, with so much as hath already been deliuered, and
        expect an exact definition and complete satisfaction by such a
        methodicall course as a generall History will require, to be
        performed by them that shall publish it.


        The Vertues.

        The Rose is of exceeding great vse with vs; for the Damaske
        Rose (besides the superexcellent sweete water it yeeldeth
        being distilled, or the perfume of the leaues being dryed,
        seruing to fill sweete bags) serueth to cause solublenesse of
        the body, made into a Syrupe, or preserued with Sugar moist
        or dry candid. The Damaske Prouince Rose, is not onely for
        sent nearest of all other Roses vnto the Damaske, but in the
        operation of solubility also. The red Rose hath many Physicall
        vses much more then any other, seruing for many sorts of
        compositions, both cordiall and cooling, both binding and
        loosing. The white Rose is much vsed for the cooling of heate
        in the eyes: diuers doe make an excellent yellow colour of the
        iuyce of white Roses, wherein some Allome is dissolued, to
        paint or colour flowers or pictures, or any other such things.
        There is little vse of any other sort of Roses; yet some
        affirme, that the Muske Roses are as strong in operation to
        open or loosen the belly as the Damaske Rose or Prouince.




CHAP. CXI.

_Cistus._   The Holly Rose or Sage Rose.


There are three principall kindes of _Cistus_, the male, the female,
and the gumme or sweete smelling _Cistus_ bearing _Ladanum_, called
_Ledon_. Of each of these three there are also diuers sorts: Of them
all to intreate in this Worke is not my minde, I will onely select out
of the multitude some few that are fit for this our Garden, and leaue
the rest to a greater.


1. _Cistus mas._   The male Holly Rose or Sage Rose.

The male _Cistus_ that is most familiar vnto our Countrey, I meane
that will best abide, is a small shrubby plant, growing seldome aboue
three or foure foote high with vs, hauing many slender brittle wooddy
branches, couered with a whitish barke, whereon are set many whitish
greene leaues, long and somewhat narrow, crumpled or wrinckled as it
were with veines, and somewhat hard in handling, especially the old
ones; for the young ones are softer, somewhat like vnto Sage leaues
for the forme and colour, but much smaller, two alwaies set together
at a ioynt: the flowers stand at the toppe of the branches, three or
foure together vpon seuerall slender footstalkes, consisting of fiue
small round leaues a peece, somewhat like vnto a small single Rose, of
a fine reddish purple colour, with many yellow threads in the middle,
without any sent at all, and quickly fading or falling away, abiding
seldome one whole day blowne at the most: after the flowers are past,
there come vp round hard hairie heads in their places, containing
small brownish seede: the roote is wooddy, and will abide some yeares
with vs, if there be some care had to keepe it from the extreamity of
our Winters frostes, which both this, and many of the other sorts and
kinds, will not abide doe what we can.


2. _Cistus fæmina._   The female Holly Rose.

The female Holly Rose groweth lower, and smaller then the former male
kinde, hauing blackish branches, lesse woody, but not lesse brittle
then it: the leaues are somewhat rounder and greener, but a little
hard or rough withall, growing in the same manner vpon the branches
by couples: the flowers grow at the toppes of the branches, like vnto
the former, consisting of fiue leaues, but somewhat lesser, and wholly
white, with yellow threds in the middle, as quickly fading, and of as
little sent as the former: the heads and seede are somewhat bigger then
in the former.


3. _Chamæcistus Frisicus._   The dwarfe Holly Rose of Friseland.

This dwarfe Cistus is a small low plant, hauing diuers shootes from
the rootes, full of leaues that are long and narrow, very like vnto
the leaues of the French Spikenard or _Spica Celtica_; from among
which leaues shoote forth short stalkes, not aboue a span high, with
a few smaller leaues thereon; and at the toppes diuers small flowers
one aboue another, consisting of six small round leaues, of a yellow
colour, hauing two circles of reddish spots round about the bottome of
the leaues, a little distant one from another, which adde much grace
to the flower: after the flowers are past, there come in their places
small round heads, being two forked at the end containing within them
small brownish chaffie seede: the roote is small and slender, with many
fibres thereat creeping vnder ground, and shooting forth in diuers
places, whereby it much encreaseth: the whole plant, and euery part of
it, smelleth strong without any pleasant sent.


4. _Cistus annuus._   The Holly Rose of a yeare.

This small Cistus that endureth but a year (and will require to be
sowne euery year, if ye will haue it) riseth vp with straight, but
slender hard stalkes, set here and there confusedly with long and
narrow greenish leaues, very like vnto the leaues of the Gum Cistus
or Ledon, being a little clammy withall: at the toppe of the stalkes,
and at the ioynts with the leaues, stand two or three pale yellow
flowers, consisting of fiue leaues a peece, with a reddish spot neere
the bottome of euery leafe of the flower, as quickely fading as any of
the former: after which follow small three square heades, containing
small seede, like vnto the first female kinde, but somewhat paler or
yellower: the root is small and woody, and perisheth as soone as it
hath borne seede.


5. _Cistus Ledon._   The Gum Cistus, or Sweete Holly Rose.

This sweete Holly Rose or Gum Cistus, riseth higher, and spreadeth
larger then the former male kind doth, with many blackish woody
branches, whereon are set diuers long and narrow darke greene leaues,
but whitish vnderneath, two alwayes standing together at a ioint, both
stalks and leaues bedeawed as it were continually with a clammy sweete
moisture (which in the hot Countries is both more plentifull, and more
sweet then in ours) almost transparent, and which being gathered by the
inhabitants, with certaine instruments for that purpose (which in some
places are leather thongs, drawne ouer the bushes, and after scraped
off from the thongs againe, and put together) is that kind of blacke
sweet gum, which is called _Ladanum_ in the Apothecaries shops; at
the tops of the branches stand single white flowers, like vnto single
Roses, being larger then in any of the former kindes, consisting of
fiue leaues, whereof euery one hath at the bottome a dark purplish
spot, broad below, and small pointed vpwards, with some yellow threds
in the middle: after which are past, there arise cornered heads,
containing such small brownish seede as is in the former male kinde:
the roote is woody, and spreadeth vnder ground, abiding some yeares, if
it be placed vnder a wall, where it may bee defended from the windes
that often breake it, and from the extremitie of our winters, and
especially the snow, if it lye vpon it, which quickly causeth it to
perish.

]


6. _Ledum Alpinum seu Rosa Alpina._   The Mountaine sweet Holly Rose.

The fragrant smell with properties correspondent of two other plants,
causeth me to insert them in this Chapter, and to bring them to your
knowledge, as well worthy a fit place in our Garden. The first of them
hath diuers slender woody branches, two foote high or thereabouts,
couered with a grayish coloured barke, and many times leaning downe to
the ground, whereby it taketh roote againe: vpon these branches grow
many thicke, short, hard greene leaues, thicke set together, confusedly
without order, sometimes whitish vnderneath, and sometimes yellowish:
the toppes of the branches are loden with many flowers, which cause
them to bend downwards, being long, hollow and reddish, opening into
fiue corners, spotted on the outside with many white spots, and of a
paler red colour on the inside, of a fine sweet sent: after the flowers
are past, there follow small heads, containing small brownish seede:
the root is long, hard and woody, abiding better if it comprehend in
the ground, then some of the former, because his originall is out of a
colder country.


7. _Ledum Silesiacum._
The sweete Mary Rose, or Rosemary of Silesia.

This other sweete plante riseth vp with woody ash-coloured branches two
foote high or more, which shoote forth other branches, of a reddish or
purplish colour, couered with a brownish yellow hoarinesse, on which
are set many narrow long greene leaues, like vnto Rosemary leaues, but
couered with the like hoarinesse as the stalks are (especially in the
naturall places, but not so much being transplanted) and folding the
sides of the leaues so close together, that they seeme nothing but
ribbes, or stalkes, of an excellent sweet and pleasant sent; at the
ends of the branches there grow certaine brownish scaly heads, made of
many small leaues set thicke together, out of which breake forth many
flowers, standing in a tuft together, yet seuerally euery one vpon his
owne footstalke, consisting of fiue white leaues, with certaine white
threds in the middle, smelling very sweete: after which rise small
greene heads, spotted with brownish spots, wherein is contained very
small, long, yellowish seede: the roote is hard and woodie.


        The Place.

        The first, second, fourth and fifth, grow in the hot Countries,
        as Italie, Spaine, &c. The third, and the two last in the
        colder Countries, as Friseland, Germanie, Bohemia.


        The Time.

        They do all flower in the Summer moneths of Iune, Iuly and
        August, and their seede is ripe quickly after.


        The Names.

        The first, second, fourth and fift, haue their names
        sufficiently expressed in their descriptions. The third was
        sent vnto Clusius, vnder the name of _Hirculus Frisicus_,
        because of the strong sent: but he referreth it to the kinds
        of _Chamæcistus_, that is, dwarfe or low _Cistus_, both for
        the low growth, and for the flowers and seede sake. The sixt
        is diuersly called; for Clusius calleth it _Ledum Alpinum_:
        others, _Nerium Alpinum_, making it to bee a Rose Bay. Gesner
        according to the Countrey peoples name, _Rosa Alpina_, and
        _Rosa Montana_. Lobel calleth it _Balsamum Alpinum_, of the
        fragrant smell it hath, and _Chamærhododendros Chamælææfolio_.
        And some haue called it _Euonymus_, without all manner of
        iudgement. In English wee may call it, The Mountaine Rose,
        vntill a fitter name be giuen it. The last is called of
        Matthiolus, _Rosmarinum siluestre_, but of Clusius _Ledum_,
        referring it to their kindred; and _Silesiacum_, because he
        found it in that Countrey; or for distinction sake, as he
        saith, it may bee called, _Ledum folijs Rosmarini_, or _Ledum
        Bohemicum_. Cordus, as it seemeth in his History of Plants,
        calleth it _Chamæpeuce_, as though he did account it a kinde of
        low Pine, or Pitch tree.


        The Vertues.

        The first, second, and fift, are very astringent, effectuall
        for all sorts of fluxes of humours. The sweet Gum called
        _Ladanum_, made artificially into oyle, is of singular vse for
        _Alopecia_, or falling of the haire. The seed of the fourth is
        much commended against the stone of the Kidneyes. The sweete
        Rosemary of Silesia is vsed of the inhabitants, where it
        naturally groweth, against the shrinking of sinewes, crampes,
        or other such like diseases, whereof their daily experience
        makes it familiar, being vsed in bathing or otherwise.




CHAP. CXII.

_Rosmarinum._   Rosemary.


There hath beene vsually knowne but one sort of Rosemary, which is
frequent through all this Country: but there are some other sorts not
so well known; the one is called Gilded Rosemary; the other broade
leafed Rosemary; a third I will adioyne, as more rare then all the
other, called Double flowred Rosmary, because few haue heard thereof,
much lesse seene it, and my selfe am not well acquainted with it, but
am bold to deliuer it vpon credit.


1. _Libanotis Coronaria siue Rosmarinum vulgare._   Our Common Rosmary.

This common Rosemary is so well knowne through all our Land, being
in euery womans garden, that it were sufficient but to name it as an
ornament among other sweete herbes and flowers in our Garden, seeing
euery one can describe it: but that I may say something of it, It is
well obserued, as well in this our Land (where it hath been planted
in Noblemens, and great mens gardens against bricke wals, and there
continued long) as beyond the Seas, in the naturall places where it
groweth, that it riseth vp in time vnto a very great height, with a
great and woody stemme (of that compasse, that (being clouen out into
thin boards) it hath serued to make lutes, or such like instruments,
and here with vs Carpenters rules, and to diuers other purposes)
branching out into diuers and sundry armes that extend a great way,
and from them againe into many other smaller branches, whereon are set
at seueral distances, at the ioynts, many very narrow long leaues,
greene aboue, and whitish vnderneath; among which come forth towards
the toppes of the stalkes, diuers sweet gaping flowers, of a pale or
bleake blewish colour, many set together, standing in whitish huskes;
the seed is small and red, but thereof seldome doth any plants arise
that will abide without extraordinary care; for although it will spring
of the seede reasonable well, yet it is so small and tender the first
yeare, that a sharpe winter killeth it quickly, vnlesse it be very well
defended: the whole plant as well leaues as flowery smelleth exceeding
sweete.


2. _Rosmarinum striatum, siue aureum._   Gilded Rosemary.

This Rosemary differeth not from the former, in forme or manner of
growing, nor in the forme or colour of the flower, but only in the
leaues, which are edged, or striped, or pointed with a faire gold
yellow colour, which so continueth all the yeare throughout, yet
fresher and fairer in Summer then in Winter; for then it will looke of
a deader colour, yet so, that it may be discerned to be of two colours,
green & yellow.


3. _Rosmarinum latifolium._   Broade leafed Rosemary.

This broad leafed Rosemary groweth in the same manner that the former
doth, but that we haue not seene it in our Countrey since we had it to
grow so great, or with such woody stemmes: the leaues stand together
vpon the long branches after the same fashion, but larger, broader and
greener then the other, and little or nothing whitish vnderneath: the
flowers likewise are of the same forme and colour with the ordinary,
but larger, and herein consisteth the difference.


4. _Rosmarinum flore duplici._   Double flowred Rosmary.

The double flowred Rosmary thus far differeth from the former, that
it hath stronger stalkes, not so easie to breake, fairer, bigger and
larger leaues, of a faire greene colour, and the flowers are double, as
the Larkes heele or spurre: This I haue onely by relation, which I pray
you accept, vntill I may by sight better enforme you.


        The Place.

        Our ordinary Rosmary groweth in Spaine, and Prouence of France,
        and in others of those hot Countryes, neere the Sea side. It
        will not abide (vnlesse kept in stoues) in many places of
        Germany, Denmarke, and those colder Countries. And in some
        extreame hard winters, it hath well neere perished here in
        England with vs, at the least in many places: but by slipping
        it is vsually, and yearly encreased, to replenish any garden.


        The Time.

        It flowreth oftentimes twice in the yeare; in the Spring first,
        from April vntill the end of May or Iune, and in August and
        September after, if the yeare before haue been temperate.


        The Names.

        Rosmary is called of the ancient Writers, _Libanotis_, but
        with this distinction, _Stephanomatica_, that is, _Coronaria_,
        because there were other plants called _Libanotis_, that were
        for other vses, as this for garlands, where flowers and sweete
        herbes were put together. The Latines call it _Rosmarinum_.
        Some would make it to be _Cneorum nigrum_ of Theophrastus,
        as they would make Lauander to bee his _Cneorum album_, but
        Matthiolus hath sufficiently confuted that errour.


        The Vertues.

        Rosmary is almost of as great vse as Bayes, or any other herbe
        both for inward and outward remedies, and as well for ciuill as
        physicall purposes. Inwardly for the head and heart; outwardly
        for the sinewes and ioynts: for ciuill vses, as all doe know,
        at weddings, funerals, &c. to bestow among friends: and the
        physicall are so many, that you might bee as well tyred in the
        reading, as I in the writing, if I should set down all that
        might be said of it. I will therefore onely giue you a taste
        of some, desiring you will be content therewith. There is an
        excellent oyle drawne from the flowers alone by the heate
        of the Sunne, auaileable for many diseases both inward and
        outward, and accounted a soueraigne Balsame: it is also good
        to helpe dimnesse of sight, and to take away spots, markes
        and scarres from the skin; and is made in this manner. Take a
        quantitie of the flowers of Rosemary, according to your owne
        will eyther more or lesse, put them into a strong glasse close
        stopped, set them in hot horse dung to digest for fourteene
        dayes, which then being taken forth of the dung, and vnstopped,
        tye a fine linnen cloth ouer the mouth, and turne downe the
        mouth thereof into the mouth of another strong glasse, which
        being set in the hot Sun, an oyle will distill downe into the
        lower glasse; which preserue as precious for the vses before
        recited, and many more, as experience by practice may enforme
        diuers.

        There is another oyle Chymically drawne, auaileable in the like
        manner for many the same inward and outward diseases, _viz._
        for the heart, rheumaticke braines, and to strengthen the
        memory, outwardly to warme and comfort cold benummed sinewes,
        whereof many of good iudgement haue had much experience.




CHAP. CXIII.

_Myrtus._   The Mirtle tree or bush.


In the hot Countreyes, there haue been many sorts of Mirtles found out,
naturally growing there, which will not fructifie in this of ours, nor
yet abide without extraordinary care, and conueniencie withall, to
preserue them from the sharpenesse of our winters. I shall only bring
you to view three sorts in this my Garden, the one with a greater, the
other two with lesser leaues, as the remainder of others which wee haue
had, and which are preserued from time to time, not without much paine
and trouble.


1. _Myrtus latifolia._   The greater leafed Mirtle.

The broader leafed Mirtle riseth vp to the height of foure or fiue
foote at the most with vs, full of branches and leaues growing like a
small bush, the stemme and elder branches whereof are couered with a
dark coloured bark, but the young with a green, and some with a red,
especially vpon the first shooting forth, whereon are set many fresh
greene leaues, very sweet in smell, and very pleasant to behold, so
neer resembling the leaues of the Pomegranate tree that groweth with
vs, that they soone deceiue many that are not expert therein, being
somewhat broade and long, and pointed at the ends, abiding alwaies
green: at the ioynts of the branches where the leaues stand, come forth
the flowers vpon small footestalkes, euery one by it selfe consisting
of fiue small white leaues, with white threds in the middle, smelling
also very sweet; after the flowers are past, there doe arise in the hot
Countries, where they are naturall, round blacke berries, when they are
ripe, wherein are contained many hard white crooked seedes, but neuer
in this Countrey, as I said before: the roote disperseth it selfe into
many branches, with many fibres annexed thereto.


2. _Myrtus minor, seu minore folio._   The smaller leafed Mirtle.

The smaller leafed Mirtle is a low shrub or bush, like vnto the former,
but scarce rising so high, with branches spreading about the stemme,
much thicker set with leaues then the former, smaller also, and pointed
at the ends, of a little deeper greene colour, abiding greene also
winter and summer, and very sweete likewise: the flowers are white like
vnto the former, and as sweete, but shew not themselues so plentifull
on the branches: the fruit is blacke in his naturall places, with
seedes therein as the former.


3. _Myrtus minor rotundiore folio._   Boxe Mirtle.

Wee haue another sort of this small kinde of Mirtle, so like vnto the
former both for smalnesse, deepe greene colour of the leaues, and
thicke growing of the branches, that it will be thought of most,
without good heede, and comparing the one with the other, to be the
very same with the former: but if it bee well viewed, it will shew, by
the roundnesse at the ends of the leaues very like vnto the small Boxe
leaues, to be another differing kinde, although in nothing else. Wee
nourse them with great care, for the beautifull aspect, sweete sent and
raritie, as delights and ornaments for a garden of pleasure, wherein
nothing should be wanting that art, care and cost might produce and
preserue: as also to set among other euer greene plants to sort with
them.


        The Place.

        These, and many other sorts of Mirtles grow in Spaine,
        Portugall, Italie, and other hot Countries in great aboundance,
        where they make their hedges of them: wee (as I said) keepe
        them in this Countrey, with very great care and diligence.


        The Time.

        The Mirtles doe flower very late with vs, not vntill August at
        the soonest, which is the cause of their not fructifying.


        The Names.

        They are called in Latine _Myrtus_, and in English Mirtle
        tree, without any other diuersitie of names, for the generall
        title. Yet the seuerall kindes haue had seuerall denominations,
        in Plinies time, and others, as _Romana_, _Coniugala_,
        _Tarentina_, _Egyptia_, _alba_, _nigra_, _&c._ which haue noted
        the differences, euen then well obserued.


        The Vertues.

        The Mirtle is of an astringent qualitie, and wholly vsed for
        such purposes.

_Malus Punica siue Granata._   The Pomegranet tree.


There are two kindes of Pomegranet trees, The one tame or manured,
bearing fruit, which is distinguished of some into two sorts, of
others into three, that is, into sower, and sweet, and into sower
sweete. The other wilde, which beareth no fruite, because it beareth
double flowers, like as the Cherry, Apple, and Peach tree with double
blossomes, before described, and is also distinguished into two sorts,
the one bearing larger, the other lesser flowers. Of the manured kinde
wee haue onely one sort (so farre as we know, for it neuer beareth
ripe fruit in this our Countrey) which for the beautifull aspect, both
of the greene verdure of the leaues, and faire proportion and colour
of the flowers, as also for the raritie, are noursed in some few of
their gardens that delight in such rarities: for in regard of the
tendernesse, there is neede of diligent care, that is, to plant it
against a brick wall, and defend it conueniently from the sharpenesse
of our winters, to giue his Master some pleasure in seeing it beare
flowers: And of the double kinde we haue as yet obtained but one sort,
although I shall giue you the knowledge and description of another.

]


1. _Malus Punica satiua._   The tame Pomegranet tree.

This Pomegranet tree groweth not very high in his naturall places, and
with vs somtimes it shooteth forth from the roote many brownish twigges
or branches, or if it bee pruned from them, and suffered to grow vp, it
riseth to bee seuen or eight foote high, spreading into many small
and slender branches, here and there set with thornes, and with many
very faire greene shining leaues, like in forme and bignesse vnto the
leaues of the larger Myrtle before described, euery one hauing a small
reddish foote-stalke vpon these branches: among the leaues come forth
here and there, long, hard, and hollow reddish cups, diuided at the
brimmes, wherein doe stand large single flowers, euery one consisting
of one whole leafe, smaller at the bottome then at the brimme, like
bels, diuided as it were at the edges into fiue or six parts, of an
orient red or crimson colour in the hotter Countries; but in this it is
much more delayed, and tendeth neare vnto a blush, with diuers threads
in the middle. The fruit is great and round, hauing as it were a crowne
on the head of it, with a thicke tough hard skinne or rinde, of a
brownish red colour on the outside, and yellow within, stuffed or packt
full of small graines, euery one encompast with a thin skin, wherein
is contained a clear red iuyce or liquor, either of a sweet (as said
before) or sower taste, or betweene them both of a winie taste: the
roote disperseth it selfe very much vnder ground.


2. _Balaustium maius siue Malus Punica siluestris maior._
The greater wilde or double blossomd Pomegranet tree.

The wilde Pomegranet is like vnto the tame in the number of purplish
branches, hauing thornes, and shining faire greene leaues, somewhat
larger then the former: from the branches likewise shoote forth
flowers, farre more beautifull then those of the same or manured sort,
because they are double, and as large as a double Prouince Rose, or
rather more double, of an excellent bright crimson colour, tending to a
silken carnation, standing in brownish cups or huskes, diuided at the
brims vsually into foure or fiue seuerall points, like vnto the former,
but that in this kinde there neuer followeth any fruit, no not in the
Country, where it is naturally wilde.


3. _Balaustium minus._   The smaller wilde Pomegranet tree.

This smaller kinde differeth from the former in his leaues, being
of a darker greene colour, but not in the height of the stemme, or
purplishnesse of his branches, or thorns vpon them; for this doth shew
it selfe more like vnto a wilde kind then it: the flowers hereof are
much smaller, and not so thicke and double, of a deeper or sadder red
Orenge tawny colour, set also in such like cups or huskes.


        The Place.

        The tame or manured kinde groweth plentifully in Spaine,
        Portugall, and Italy, and other in other warme and hot
        countries. Wee (as I said before) preserue it with great care.
        The wilde I thinke was neuer seene in England, before Iohn
        Tradescante my very louing good friend brought it from the
        parts beyond the Seas, and planted it in his Lords Garden at
        Canterbury.


        The Time.

        They flower very late with vs, that is, not vntill the middle
        or end of August, and the cold euenings or frosts comming so
        soone vpon it, doth not onely hinder it from bearing, but many
        times the sharpe winters so pinch it, that it withereth it
        downe to the ground, so that oftentimes it hardly springeth
        againe.


        The Names.

        The name _Malus Punica_ for the tree, and _Malum Punicum_ for
        the fruit, or _Malus Granata_, and _Malum Granatum_, is the
        common name giuen vnto this tree, which is called in English
        the Pomegarnet or Pomegranet tree. The flowers of the tame
        kinde are called _Cytini_, as Dioscorides saith, although
        Plinie seemeth either to make _Cytinus_ to be the flower of
        the wilde kinde, or _Balaustium_ to be the flower of both
        tame and wilde kinde: but properly, as I take it, _Cytinus_
        is the cup wherein the flower as well of the tame as wilde
        kinde doth stand; for vnto the similitude of them, both the
        flowers of _Asarum_, and the seede vessels of _Hyosciamus_ are
        compared and resembled, and not vnto the whole flower: the
        barke or rinde of the fruit is called of diuers _Sidion_, and
        in the Apothecaries shops _Psidium_, and _cortex Granatorum_.
        The wilde kinde is called _Malus Punica siluestris_: In
        English, The wilde Pomegranet tree; the flower thereof is
        properly called _Balaustium_. The lesser kind is vsually called
        _Balaustium Romanum_, as the greater is called _Creticum_ and
        _Cyprium_, because they growe in Candy and Cyprus.


        The Vertues.

        The vse of all these Pomegranets is very much in Physicke, to
        coole and binde all fluxibility both of body and humours: they
        are also of singular effect in all vlcers of the mouth, and
        other parts of the body, both of man and woman. There is no
        part of them but is applyed for some of these respects. The
        rinde also of the Pomegranet is vsed of diuers in stead of
        Gaules, to make the best sort of writing Inke, which is durable
        to the worlds end.




CHAP. CXV.

_Amomum Plinij seu Pseudocapsicum._
Tree Night shade or the Winter Cherry tree.


I haue adioyned this plant, for the pleasurable beauty of the greene
leaues, and red berries. It groweth vp to be a yard or foure foote
high at the most, hauing a small wooddy stemme or stocke, as bigge as
ones finger or thumbe, couered with a whitish greene barke, set full
of greene branches, and faire greene leaues, somewhat vneuen sometimes
on the edges, narrower then any Night shade leaues, and very neare
resembling the leaues of the _Capsicum_, or Ginny pepper, but smaller
and narrower, falling away in the Winter, and shooting fresh in the
Spring of the yeare: the flowers growe often two or three together,
at the ioynts of the branches with the leaues, being white, opening
starre-fashion, and sometimes turning themselues backe, with a yellow
pointell in the middle, very like vnto the flowers of Night shade:
after the flowers are past, come forth in their stead small greene
buttons, which after turne to be pleasant round red berries, of the
bignesse of small Cherries when they are ripe, which with vs vsually
ripen not vntill the Winter, or about Christmas, wherein are contained
many small whitish seede that are flat: all the whole plant, as well
leaues and flowers as seede, are without either smell or taste: the
roote hath many yellowish strings and fibres annexed vnto it.


        The Place.

        The originall place hereof is not well knowne, but is thought
        to bee the West Indies. It hath been planted of long time in
        most of these Countries, where it abideth reasonable well, so
        that some care bee had thereof in the extreamity of the Winter.


        The Time.

        It flowreth sometimes it Iune but vsually in Iuly and August,
        and the fruit is not ripe (as is said) vntill the Winter.


        The Names.

        This plant hath diuers names; for it is thought to be that
        kinde of _Amomum_ that Plinie setteth downe. Dodonæus calleth
        it _Pseudocapsicum_, for some likenesse in the leafe and
        fruit vnto the small _Capsicum_ or Ginnie Pepper, although
        much vnlike in the taste and property. Others doe call it
        _Strichnodendron_, that is, _Solanum arborescens_, and wee
        in English according thereunto, Tree Night shade. But some
        Latin asses corrupting the Latine word _Amomum_, doe call it
        the Mumme tree. Dalechampius calleth it _Solanum Americum,
        seu Indicum_, and saith the Spaniards call it in their
        tongue, _Guindas de las Indias_, that is, _Cerasa Indiana_,
        Indian Cherries, which if any would follow, I would not bee
        much against it: but many Gentlewomen, doe call them Winter
        Cherries, because the fruit is not throughly ripe vntill Winter.


        The Vertues.

        I finde no physicall property allotted vnto it, more then that
        by reason of the insipidity, it is held to be cooling.




CHAP. CXVI.

_Ficus Indica minor._   The smaller Indian Figge tree.


This Indian Figge tree, if you will call it a tree (because in our
Country it is not so, although it groweth in the naturall hot Countries
from a wooddy stemme or body into leaues) is a plant consisting only of
leaues, one springing out of another, into many branches of leaues, and
all of them growing out of one leafe, put into the ground halfe way,
which taking roote, all the rest rise out thereof, those belowe for
the most part being larger then those aboue; yet all of them somewhat
long, flat, and round pointed, of the thicknesse of a finger vsually,
and smallest at the lower end, where they are ioyned or spring out of
the other leaues, hauing at their first breaking out a shew of small,
red, or browne prickes, thicke set ouer all the vpper side of the
leaues, but with vs falling away quickly, leauing onely the markes
where they stood: but they haue besides this shew of great prickes, a
few very fine, and small, hard, white, and sharpe, almost insensible
prickes, being not so bigge as haires on the vnderside, which will
often sticke in their fingers that handle them vnaduisedly, neither are
they to be discerned vnlesse one look precisely for them: the leaues
on the vnderside hauing none of those other great pricks or marks at
all, being of a faire fresh pale green colour: out of the vppermost
leaues breake forth certaine greene heads, very like vnto leaues (so
that many are deceiued, thinking them to be leaues, vntill they marke
them better, and be better experienced in them) but that they growe
round and not flat, and are broad at the toppe; for that out of the
tops of euery of them shooteth out a pale yellow flower, consisting of
two rowes of leaues, each containing fiue leaues a peece, laid open
with certaine yellow threads, tipt with red in the middle: this greene
head, vntill the flower be past, is not of halfe that bignesse that
it attaineth vnto after, yet seldome or neuer commeth vnto perfection
with vs, being long and round, like vnto a Figge, small belowe, and
greater aboue, bearing vpon the flat or broad head the marke of the
flower; some holding still on them the dryed leaues, and others hauing
lost them shew the hollownesse which they haue in the toppe or middle
of the head, the sides round about being raised or standing vp higher:
this head or figge in our Country abideth greene on the outside, and
little or nothing reddish within (although it abide all the Winter, and
the Summer following, as sometimes it doth) for want of that heate and
comfort of the Sunne it hath in his naturall place, where it groweth
reddish on the outside, and containing within it a bloudy red clammy
iuyce, making the vrine of them that eate of them as red as bloud,
which many seeing, were in doubt of themselues, lest their vrine were
not very bloud; of what sweetnesse, like a figge, in the naturall
places, I am not well assured, yet affirmed: but those that haue beene
brought vnto me, whose colour on the outside was greenish, were of a
reddish purple within, and contained within them round, small, hard
seede, the taste was flat, waterish, or insipide: the roote is neither
great, nor disperseth it selfe very deepe or farre, but shooteth many
small rootes vnder the vpper crust of the earth.

There is a greater kinde hereof, whose leaues are twice or thrice as
bigge, which hauing been often brought vs, will seldome abide more then
one Summer with vs, our Winters alwaies rotting the leaues, that it
could not be longer kept.


        The Place.

        This Indian Figge tree groweth dispersedly in many places of
        America, generally called the West Indies: The greater kinde in
        the more remote and hot Countries, as Mexico, Florida, &c. and
        in the Bermudas or Summer Islands, from whence wee haue often
        had it. The lesser in Virginia, and those other Countries that
        are nearer vnto vs, which better endureth with vs.


        The Time.

        It flowreth with vs sometimes in May, or Iune; but (as I said)
        the fruit neuer commeth to perfection in this Country.


        The Names.

        Diuers doe take it to bee _Opuntia Plinij_, whereof hee
        speaketh in the 21. Booke and 17. Chapter of his Naturall
        History: but he there saith, _Opuntia_ is an herbe, sweete
        and pleasant to be eaten, and that it is a wonder that the
        roote should come from the leafe, and so to growe; which words
        although they descipher out the manner of the growing of this
        plant, yet because this is a kinde of tree, and not an herbe,
        nor to be eaten, it cannot bee the same: but especially because
        there is an herbe which groweth in the same manner, or very
        neare vnto it, one leafe standing on the toppe or side of
        another, being a Sea plant, fit to be eaten with vinegar and
        oyle (as many other herbes are that growe in the salt marshes,
        or neare the Sea, whereof Sea Purslane is one) which Clusius
        calleth _Lychen Marinus_, and (as Clusius saith) Cortusus very
        fitly called _Opuntia marina_, and out of doubt is the verie
        same _Opuntia_ that Theophrastus maketh mention of, and Plinie
        out of him. Our English people in Virginia, and the Bermuda
        Island, where it groweth plentifully, because of the form of
        the fruit, which is somewhat like to a Peare, & not being so
        familiarly acquainted with the growing of Figs, sent it vnto
        vs by the name of the prickly Peare, from which name many haue
        supposed it to be a Peare indeede, but were therein deceiued.


        The Vertues.

        There is no other especiall property giuen hereunto, by any
        that haue written of the West Indies, then of the colouring of
        the vrine, as is before said.




CHAP. CXVII.

_Yuca siue Iucca._   The supposed Indian Iucca.


This rare Indian plant hath a great thicke tuberous roote (spreading
in time into many tuberous heads) from the head whereof shooteth forth
many long, hard, and guttured leaues, very sharpe pointed, compassing
as it were one another at the bottome, of a grayish greene colour,
which doe not fall away, but abide euer greene on the plant; from the
middle whereof springeth forth (now and then, but not euery yeare)
a strong round stalke, diuided into diuers branches, whereon stand
diuers white, and somewhat large flowers, hanging downe their heads,
consisting of six leaues, with diuers veines, of a weake reddish or
blush colour, spread on the backe of the three outer leaues, especially
from the middle of the leaues to the bottome, and not rising to the
edge of the leafe of any flower, which fall away without bearing any
seede in our Country, as farre as euer could be obserued either in
the plant that Master Gerard kept a long time by him, or by Robinus
at Paris his plant, which Master Gerard sent vnto him, or yet by that
plant, that Vespasian Robin the sonne of old Robin sent vnto Master
Iohn de Franqueuille, and now abideth and flourisheth in my Garden.


        The Place.

        It was first brought into England (as Master Gerard saith)
        from the West Indies, by a seruant of Master Thomas Edwards,
        an Apothecary of Exeter, and imparted to him, who kept it vnto
        his death: but perished with him that got it from his widow,
        intending to send it to his Country house.


        The Time.

        It flowreth not vntill Iuly, and the flowers fall away
        sodainely, after they haue beene blowne open a while.


        The Names.

        Master Gerard first as I thinke called it _Iucca_, supposing it
        to bee the true _Yuca_ of _Theuet_, wherewith the Indians make
        bread, called _Cassaua_: but the true _Iucca_ is described to
        haue a leafe diuided into seuen or nine parts, which this hath
        not: Yet not knowing by what better name to call it, let it
        hold still his first imposition, vntill a fitter may be giuen
        it.


        The Vertues.

        Wee haue not heard of any, that hath either read, heard, or
        experimented the faculties hereof, nor yet whether it hath good
        or euill taste; for being rare, and possessed but by a few,
        they that haue it are loth to cut any thereof, for feare of
        spoiling and losing the whole roote.

        Some haue affirmed, that in some parts of Turkie, where as they
        say this plant groweth, they make a kinde of cloth from the
        threads are found running through the leaues; but I finde the
        threads are so strong and hard, that this cannot be that plant
        the relators meane is vsed in that manner.

CHAP. CXVIII.

_Arbor vitæ._   The tree of life.


The tree of life riseth vp in some places where it hath stood long,
to be a tree of a reasonable great bignesse and height, couered
with a redder barke then any other tree in our Country that I know,
the wood whereof is firme and hard, and spreadeth abroad many armes
and branches, which againe send forth many smaller twigges, bending
downewards; from which twiggy or slender branches, being flat
themselues like the leaues, come forth on both sides many flat winged
leaues, somewhat like vnto Sauine, being short and small, but not
pricking, seeming as if they were brayded or folded like vnto a lace
or point, of a darke yellowish greene colour, abiding greene on the
branches Winter and Summer, of a strong resinous taste, not pleasing
to most, but in some ready to procure casting, yet very cordiall
and pectorall also to them that can endure it: at the toppes of the
branches stand small yellowish dounie flowers, set in small scaly
heads, wherein lye small, long, brownish seede, which ripen well in
many places, and being sowne, doe spring and bring forth plants, which
with some small care will abide the extreamest Winters we haue.


        The Place.

        The first or originall place where it naturally groweth, as
        farre as I can learne or vnderstand, is that part of America
        which the French doe inhabite, about the riuer of Canada, which
        is at the backe of Virginia Northward, and as it seemeth, first
        brought by them from thence into Europe, in the time of Francis
        the first French King, where it hath so plentifully encreased,
        and so largely beene distributed, that now few Gardens of
        respect, either in France, Germany, the Lowe Countries, or
        England, are without it.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in the end of May, and in Iune; the fruit is ripe
        in the end of August and September.


        The Names.

        All the Writers that haue written of it, since it was first
        knowne, haue made it to be _Thuyæ genus_, a kinde of Thuya,
        which Theophrastus compareth vnto a Cypresse tree, in his fifth
        Book and fifth Chapter: but _Omne simile non est idem_, and
        although it haue some likenesse, yet I verily beleeue it is
        _proprium sui genus_, a proper kinde of it owne, not to bee
        paralleld with any other. For wee finde but very few trees,
        herbes, or plants in America, like vnto those that growe in
        Europe, the hither part of Africa, or in the lesser Asia, as
        experience testifieth. Some would make it to be _Cedrus Lycia_,
        but so it cannot be. The French that first brought it, called
        it _Arbor vitæ_, with what reason or vpon what ground I know
        not; but euer since it hath continued vnder the title of the
        Tree of life.


        The Vertues.

        It hath beene found by often experience, that the leaues hereof
        chewed in the morning fasting, for some few dayes together,
        haue done much good to diuers, that haue beene troubled with
        shortnesse of breath, and to helpe to expectorate thinne
        purulentous matter stuffing the lungs. Other properties I haue
        not heard that it hath; but doubtlesse, the hot resinous smell
        and taste it hath, both while it is fresh, and after it hath
        beene long kept dry, doth euidently declare his tenuity of
        parts, a digesting and cleansing quality it is possessed with,
        which if any industrious would make tryall, hee should finde
        the effects.




CHAP. CXIX.

_Arbor Iudæ._   Iudas tree.


Iudas tree riseth vp in some places, where it standeth open from a
wall, and alone free from other trees (as in a Garden at Batthersey,
which sometimes agoe belonged to Master Morgan, Apothecary to the late
Queene Elizabeth of famous memory) to be a very great and tall tree,
exceeding any Apple tree in height, and equall in bignesse of body
thereunto (as my selfe can testifie, being an eye witnesse thereof)
when as it had many stalkes of flowers, being in the bud, breaking
out of the body of the tree through the barke in diuers places, when
as there was no bough or branch near them by a yard at the least, or
yet any leafe vpon the tree, (which they gathered to put among other
flowers, for Nosegayes) and in other places it groweth to bee but
an hedge bush, or plant, with many suckers and shootes from belowe,
couered with a darke reddish barke, the young branches being more red
or purplish: the flowers on the branches come forth before any shew
or budding of leaues, three or foure standing together vpon a small
foote-stalke, which are in fashion like vnto Pease blossomes, but of
an excellent deepe purplish crimson colour: after which come in their
places so many long, flat, large, and thinne cods, of a brownish
colour, wherein are contained small, blackish browne, flat, and hard
seede: the roote is great, and runneth both deepe, and farre spreading
in the earth: the leaues come forth by themselues, euery one standing
on a long stalke, being hard & very round, like vnto the leafe of the
largest _Asarum_, but not so thick, of a whitish green on the vpper
side, and grayish vnderneath, which fall away euery yeare, and spring
a fresh after the Spring is well come in, and the buds of flowers are
sprung.

[Sidenote: _Flore albo._]

There is another of this kinde, growing in some places very high,
somewhat like the former, and in other places also full of twiggy
branches, which are greener then the former, as the leaues are
likewise: the flowers of this kinde are wholly white, and the cods
nothing so red or browne, in all other things agreeing together.


        The Place.

        The former groweth plentifully in many places of Spaine, Italy,
        Prouence in France, and in many other places. The other hath
        beene sent vs out of Italy many times, and the seede hath
        sprung very well with vs, but it is somewhat tender to keepe in
        the Winter.


        The Time.

        The flowers (as I said) appeare before the leaues, and come
        forth in Aprill and May, and often sooner also, the leaues
        following shortly after; but neither of them beareth perfect
        seede in our Country, that euer I could learne, or know by mine
        owne or others experience.


        The Names.

        Some would referre this to _Cercis_, whereof Theophrastus
        maketh mention in his first Booke and eighteenth Chapter, among
        those trees that beare their fruit in cods, like as Pulse doe:
        and hee remembreth it againe in the fourteenth Chapter of his
        third Booke, and maketh it not vnlike the white Poplar tree,
        both in greatnesse and whitenesse of the branches, with the
        leafe of an Iuie, without corners on the one part, cornered
        on the other, and sharpe pointed, greene on both sides almost
        alike, hauing so slender long footestalkes that the leaues
        cannot stand forthright, but bend downwards, with a more rugged
        barke then the white Poplar tree. Clusius thinketh this large
        description is but an ample description of the third kinde of
        Poplar, called _Lybica_, the Aspen tree, which Gaza translateth
        _Alpina_: but who so will well consider it, shall finde it
        neyther answerable to any Poplar tree, in that it beareth not
        cods as _Cercis_ doth; nor vnto this _Arbor Iudæ_, because
        it beareth not white branches. Clusius saith also, that the
        learned of Mompelier in his time, referred it to _Colytea_
        of Theophrastus in his third booke and seuenteenth chapter,
        where he doth liken it to the leaues of the broadest leafed
        Bay tree, but larger and rounder, green on the vpperside, and
        whitish vnderneath, and whereunto (as he saith) Theophrastus
        giueth cods in the fourteenth chapter of the same third booke:
        and by the contracting of their descriptions both together,
        saith, they agree vnto this Iudas tree. But I find some doubts
        and differences in these places: for the _Colutæa_ that
        Theophrastus mentioneth in the said fourteenth chapter of his
        third booke, hath (as he saith there) a leafe like vnto the
        Willow, and therefore cannot bee the same _Colutæa_ mentioned
        in the seuenteenth chapter of the same third book, which hath
        a broade Bay leafe: indeede hee giueth seede in cods: but that
        with broade Bay leaues is (as he saith) without eyther flower
        or fruite; and besides all this, he saith the rootes are very
        yellow, which is not to bee found in this _Arbor Iudæ_, or
        Iudas tree: let others now iudge if these things can bee well
        reconciled together. Some haue for the likenesse of the cods
        vnto Beane cods, called it _Fabago_. And Clusius called it
        _Siliqua siluestris_. It is generally in these dayes called
        _Arbor Iudæ_, and in English after the Latine name, vntill a
        fitter may be had, Iudas tree.


        The Vertues.

        There is nothing extant in any Author of any Physicall vse it
        hath, neyther hath any later experience found out any.




CHAP. CXX.

_Laburnum._   Beane Trefoile.


There be three sorts of these codded trees or plants, one neere
resembling another, whereof _Anagyris_ of Dioscorides is one. The
other two are called _Laburnum_; the larger whereof Matthiolus calleth
_Anagyris altera_, and so doe some others also: the third is of the
same kinde with the second, but smaller. I shall not for this our
Garden trouble you or my selfe with any more of them then one, which
is the lesser of the two _Laburnum_, in that it is more frequent, and
that it will far better abide then the _Anagyris_, which is so tender,
that it will hardly endure the winters of our Countrey: and the greater
_Laburnum_ is not so easily to be had.


_Laburnum._   Beane Trefoile.

This codded tree riseth vp with vs like vnto a tall tree, with a
reasonable great body, if it abide any long time in a place, couered
with a smooth greene barke; the branches are very long, greene, pliant,
and bending any way, whereon are set here and there diuers leaues,
three alwaies standing together vpon a long stalk, being somewhat long,
and not very narrow, pointed at the ends, greene on the vpperside, and
of a siluer shining colour vnderneath, without any smell at all: at
the ioynts of these branches, where the leaues stand, come forth many
flowers, much like vnto broome flowers, but not so large or open,
growing about a very long branch or stalke, sometimes a good span or
more in length, and of a faire yellow colour, but not very deepe; after
which come flat thin cods, not very long or broade, but as tough and
hard as the cods of Broome; wherein are contained blackish seede, like,
but much lesse then the seede of _Anagyris vera_ (which are as big as
a kidney beane, purplish and spotted): the roote thrusteth down deepe
into the ground, spreading also farre, and is of a yellowish colour.


        The Place.

        This tree groweth naturally in many of the woods of Italie, and
        vpon the Alpes also, and is therefore still accounted to be
        that _Laburnum_ that Plinie calleth _Arbor Alpina_. It groweth
        in many gardens with vs.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in May, the fruit or cods, and the seedes therein
        are ripe in the end of August, or in September.


        The Names.

        This tree (as I said before) is called of Matthiolus _Anagyris
        altera_, _siue secunda_, of Cordus, Gesner and others,
        especially of most now adayes, _Laburnum_. It is probable in my
        opinion, that this should bee that _Colutæa_ of Theophrastus,
        mentioned in the fourteenth Chapter of his third book with the
        leafe of a Willow; for if you take any one leafe by it selfe,
        it may well resemble a Willow leafe both for forme and colour,
        and beareth small seed in cods like vnto pulse as that doth.
        Of some it hath beene taken for a kinde of _Cytisus_, but not
        truely. We call it in English, Beane Trefoile, in regard of his
        cods and seede therein, somewhat like vnto Kidney Beanes, and
        of the leaues, three alwayes standing together, vntill a more
        proper name may bee giuen it.


        The Vertues.

        There is no vse hereof in Physicke with vs, nor in the naturall
        place of the growing, saue only to prouoke a vomit, which it
        will doe very strongly.




CHAP. CXXI.

_Cytisus._   Tree Trefoile.


There are so many sorts of _Cytisus_ or Tree trefoiles, that if I
should relate them all, I should weary the Reader to ouerlooke them,
whereof the most part pertaine rather to a generall worke then to this
abstract. I shall not therefore trouble you with any superfluous, but
only with two, which we haue noursed vp to furnish waste places in a
garden.


_Cytisus Maranthe._   Horned Tree Trefoile.

This Tree Trefoile which is held of most Herbarists to bee the true
_Cytisus_ of Dioscorides, riseth vp to the height of a man at the most,
with a body of the bignesse of a mans thumbe, couered with a whitish
bark, breaking forth into many whitish branches spreading farre, beset
in many places with small leaues, three alwayes set together vpon a
small short footestalke, which are rounder, and whiter then the leaues
of Beane Trefoile: at the ends of the branches for the most part, come
forth the flowers three or foure together, of a fine gold colour, and
of the fashion of Broome flowers, but not so large: after the flowers
are past, there come in their places crooked flat thinne cods, of the
fashion of a halfe moone, or crooked horne, whitish when they are ripe,
wherein are contained blackish seede: the roote is hard and woody,
spreading diuers wayes vnder the ground: the whole plant hath a pretty
small hot sent.


_Cytisus vulgatior._   The common Tree Trefoile.

This _Cytisus_ is the most common in this Land, of any the other sorts
of tree trefoiles, hauing a blackish coloured barke, the stemme or
body whereof is larger then the former, both for height and spreading,
bearing also three leaues together, but smaller and greener then the
former: the flowers are smaller, but of the same fashion and colour:
the cods blackish and thin, and not very long, or great, but lesser
then Broome cods, wherein there lyeth small blackish hard seede: the
roote is diuersly dispersed in the ground.


        The Place.

        The first groweth in the kingdome of Naples, and no doubt in
        many other places of Italie, as Matthiolus saith. The other
        groweth in diuers places of France.


        The Time.

        They flower for the most part in May or Iune: the seede is ripe
        in August or September.


        The Names.

        The first (as I said) is thought of most to be the true
        _Cytisus_ of Dioscorides, and as is thought, was in these later
        dayes first found by Bartholomæus Maranta of Naples, who sent
        it first to Matthiolus, and thereupon hath euer since beene
        called after his name, _Cytisus Maranthæ_. Some doe call it
        _Cytisus Lunatus_, because the cods are made somewhat like vnto
        an halfe Moone. We call it in English, Horned Tree Trefoile.
        The other is called _Cytisus vulgaris_ or _vulgatior_; in
        English, The common Tree Trefoile, because we haue not any
        other so common.


        The Vertues.

        The chiefest vertues that are appropriate to these plants, are
        to procure milke in womens breasts, to fatten pullen, sheep &c.
        and to be good for bees.




CHAP. CXXII.

_Colutæa._   The Bastard Sena Tree.


Wee haue in our Gardens two or three sorts of the Bastard Sena tree; a
greater as I may so call it, and two lesser: the one with round thin
transparent skins like bladders, wherein are the seede: the other with
long round cods, the one bunched out or swelling in diuers places, like
vnto a Scorpions tale, wherein is the seede, and the other very like
vnto it, but smaller.


1. _Colutæa Vesicaria._   The greater Bastard Sena with bladders.

This shrub or tree, or shrubby tree, which you please to call it,
riseth vp to the height of a pretty tree, the stemme or stock being
sometimes of the bignesse of a mans arme, couered with a blackish
greene rugged barke, the wood whereof is harder then of an Elder,
but with an hollownesse like a pith in the heart or middle of the
branches, which are diuided many wayes, and whereon are set at seuerall
distances, diuers winged leaues, composed of many small round pointed,
or rather flat pointed leaues, one set against another, like vnto
Licoris, or the Hatchet Fitch; among these leaues come forth the
flowers, in fashion like vnto Broome flowers, and as large, of a very
yellow colour: after which appeare cleare thinne swelling cods like
vnto thinne transparent bladders, wherein are contained blacke seede,
set vpon a middle ribbe or sinew in the middle of the bladder, which if
it be a little crushed betweene the fingers, will giue a cracke, like
as a bladder full of winde. The roote groweth branched and woody.


2. _Colutæa Scorpioides maior._
The greater Scorpion podded Bastard Sena.

This Bastard Sena groweth nothing so great or tall, but shooteth out
diuersly, like vnto a shrub, with many shoots springing from the root:
the branches are greener, but more rugged, hauing a white barke on
the best part of the elder growne branches; for the young are greene,
and haue such like winged leaues set on them as are to be seen in
the former, but smaller, greener, and more pointed: the flowers are
yellow, but much smaller, fashioned somewhat like vnto the former,
with a reddish stripe downe the backe of the vppermost leafe: the long
cods that follow are small, long and round, distinguished into many
diuisions or dents, like vnto a Scorpions tayle, from whence hath risen
the name: in these seuerall diuisions lye seuerall blacke seede, like
vnto the seede of Fenigrecke: the roote is white and long, but not so
woody as the former.


3. _Colutæa Scorpioides minor._   The lesser Scorpion Bastard Sena.

This lesser Bastard Sena is in all things like the former, but somewhat
lower, and smaller both in leafe, flower, and cods of seede, which haue
not such eminent bunches on the cods to be seene as the former.


        The Place.

        They grow as Matthiolus saith about Trent in Italie, and in
        other places: the former is frequent enough through all our
        Countrey, but the others are more rare.


        The Time.

        They flower about the middle or end of May, and their seede is
        ripe in August. The bladders of the first will abide a great
        while on the tree, if they be suffered, and vntill the winde
        cause them to rattle, and afterwards the skins opening, the
        seede will fall away.


        The Names.

        The name _Colutæa_ is imposed on them, and by the iudgement
        of most writers, the first is taken to bee that _Colutæa_
        of _Lipara_ that Theophrastus maketh mention of, in the
        seuenteenth chapter of his third booke. But I should rather
        thinke that the _Scorpioides_ were the truer _Colutæa_ of
        Theophrastus, because the long pods thereof are more properly
        to bee accounted _filiquæ_, then the former which are _vesicæ
        tumentes_, windy bladders, and not _filiquæ_: and no doubt
        but Theophrastus would haue giuen some peculiar note of
        difference if he had meant those bladders, and not these cods.
        Let others of iudgement be vmpeeres in this case; although I
        know the currant of writers since Matthiolus, doe all hold the
        former _Colutæa vesicaria_ to be the true _Colutæa Liparæ_
        of Theophrastus. Wee call it in English, Bastard Sena, from
        Ruellius, who as I thinke first called it Sena, from the forme
        of the leaues. The second and third (as I said before) from
        the forme of the cods receiued their names, as it is in the
        titles and descriptions; yet they may as properly be called
        _Siliquosæ_, for that their fruite are long cods.


        The Vertues.

        Theophrastus saith it doth wonderfully helpe to fatten sheepe:
        But sure it is found by experience, that if it be giuen to man
        it causeth strong purgings both vpwards and downwards; and
        therefore let euery one beware that they vse not this in steede
        of good Sena, lest they feele to their cost the force thereof.




CHAP. CXXIII.

_Spartum Hispanicum frutex._   Spanish Broome.


Although Clusius and others haue found diuers sorts of this shrubby
Spartum or Spanish Broome, yet because our Climate will nourse vp none
of them, and euen this very hardly, I shall leaue all others, and
describe vnto you this one only in this manner: Spanish Broome groweth
to bee fiue or sixe foote high, with a woody stemme below, couered with
a darke gray, or ash-coloured barke, and hauing aboue many pliant, long
and slender greene twigs, whereon in the beginning of the yeare are set
many small long greene leaues, which fall away quickly, not abiding
long on; towards the tops of these branches grow the flowers, fashioned
like vnto Broom flowers, but larger, as yellow as they, and smelling
very well; after which come small long cods, crested at the backe,
wherein is contained blackish flat seede, fashioned very like vnto the
Kidney beanes: the roote is woody, dispersing it selfe diuers waies.


        The Place.

        This groweth naturally in many places of France, Spaine and
        Italie, wee haue it as an ornament in our Gardens, among other
        delightfull plants, to please the senses of sight and smelling.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in the end of May, or beginning of Iune, and
        beareth seede, which ripeneth not with vs vntill it be late.


        The Names.

        It is called _Spartium Græcorum_, and _Spartum frutex_, to
        distinguish it from the sedge or rush, that is so called also.
        Of some it is called _Genista_, and thought not to differ from
        the other _Genista_, but they are much deceiued; for euen in
        Spaine and Italie, the ordinary _Genista_ or Broome groweth
        with it, which is not pliant, and fit to binde Vines, or such
        like things withall as this is.


        The Vertues.

        There is little vse hereof in Physicke, by reason of the
        dangerous qualitie of vomiting, which it doth procure to them
        that take it inwardly: but being applyed outwardly, it is found
        to helpe the _Sciaticæ_ or paine of the hippes.

_Periploca recta Virginiana._   Virginian Silke.


Lest this stranger should find no hospitality with vs, being so
beautifull a plant, or not finde place in this Garden, let him be here
receiued, although with the last, rather then not at all. It riseth vp
with one or more strong and round stalkes, three or foure foote high,
whereon are set at the seuerall ioynts thereof two faire, long, and
broad leaues, round pointed, with many veines therein, growing close to
the stemme, without any foote-stalke: at the tops of the stalkes, and
some times at the ioynts of the leaues, groweth forth a great bush of
flowers out of a thinne skinne, to the number of twenty, and sometimes
thirty or forty, euery one with a long foote-stalke, hanging downe
their heads for the most part, especially those that are outermost,
euery one standing within a small huske of greene leaues, turned to
the stalkeward, like vnto the Lysimachia flower of Virginia before
described, and each of them consisting of fiue small leaues a peece,
of a pale-purplish colour on the vpperside, and of a pale yellowish
purple vnderneath, both sides of each leafe being as it were folded
together, making them seeme hollow and pointed, with a few short chiues
in the middle: after which come long and crooked pointed cods standing
vpright, wherein are contained flat brownish seede, dispersedly lying
within a great deale of fine, soft, and whitish browne silke, very
like vnto the cods, seede, and silke of _Asclepias_, or Swallow-wort,
but that the cods are greater and more crooked, and harder also in
the outer shell: the roote is long and white, of the bignesse of a
mans thumbe, running vnder ground very far, and shooting vp in diuers
places, the heads being set full of small white grumes or knots,
yeelding forth many branches, if it stand any time in a place: the
whole plant, as well leaues as stalkes, being broken, yeeld a pale
milke.


        The Place.

        It came to me from Virginia, where it groweth aboundantly,
        being raised vp from the seede I receiued.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in Iuly, and the seede is ripe in August.


        The Names.

        It may seeme very probable to many, that this plant is the same
        that Prosper Alpinus in the twenty fift Chapter of his Booke
        of Egyptian plants, nameth _Beidelsar_; and Honorius Bellus
        in his third and fourth Epistles vnto Clusius (which are at
        the end of his History of plants) calleth _Ossar frutex_: And
        Clusius himselfe in the same Booke calleth _Apocynum Syriacum_,
        _Palæstinum_, and _Ægyptiacum_, because this agreeth with
        theirs in very many and notable parts; yet verily I thinke this
        plant is not the same, but rather another kinde of it selfe:
        First, because it is not _frutex_, a shrub or wooddy plant,
        nor keepeth his leaues all the yeare, but loseth both leaues
        and stalks, dying down to the ground euery yeare: Secondly,
        the milke is not causticke or violent, as Alpinus and Bellus
        say _Ossar_ is: Thirdly, the cods are more crooked then those
        of Clusius, or of Alpinus, which Honorius Bellus acknowledgeth
        to be right, although greater then those he had out of Egypt:
        And lastly, the rootes of these doe runne, whereof none of them
        make any mention. Gerard in his herball giueth a rude figure of
        the plant, but a very true figure of the cods with seede, and
        saith the Virginians call it _Wisanck_, and referreth it to the
        _Asclepias_, for the likenesse of the cods stuffed with silken
        doune. But what reason Caspar Bauhinus in his _Pinax Theatri
        Botanici_ had, to call it (for it is Clusius his _Apocynum
        Syriacum_) by the name of _Lapathum Ægyptiacum lactescens
        siliqua Asclepiadis_, I know none in the world: for but that he
        would shew an extreame singularity in giuing names to plants,
        contrary to all others (which is very frequent with him) how
        could he thinke, that this plant could haue any likenesse or
        correspondencie, with any of the kindes of Dockes, that euer
        he had seene, read, or heard of, in face, or shew of leaues,
        flowers, or seede; but especially in giuing milke. I haue you
        see (and that not without iust and euident cause) giuen it a
        differing Latine name from Gerard, because the _Asclepias_
        giueth no milke, but the _Periploca_ or _Apocymum_ doth; and
        therefore fitter to be referred to this then to that. And
        because it should not want an English name answerable to some
        peculiar property thereof, I haue from the silken doune called
        it Virginian Silke: but I know there is another plant growing
        in Virginia, called Silke Grasse, which is much differing from
        this.


        The Vertues.

        I know not of any in our Land hath made any tryall of the
        properties hereof. Captaine Iohn Smith in his booke of the
        discouery and description of Virginia, saith, that the
        Virginians vse the rootes hereof (if his be the same with this)
        being bruised and applyed to cure their hurts & diseases.




CHAP. CXXV.

_Ligustrum._   Primme or Priuet.


Because the vse of this plant is so much, and so frequent throughout
all this Land, although for no other purpose but to make hedges or
arbours in Gardens, &c. whereunto it is so apt, that no other can be
like vnto it, to bee cut, lead, and drawne into what forme one will,
either of beasts, birds, or men armed, or otherwise: I could not
forget it, although it be so well knowne vnto all, to be an hedge bush
growing from a wooddy white roote, spreading much within the ground,
and bearing manie long, tough, and plyant sprigs and branches, whereon
are set long, narrow, and pointed sad greene leaues by couples at euery
ioynt: at the tops whereof breake forth great tufts of sweete smelling
white flowers, which when they are fallen, turne into small blacke
berries, hauing a purple iuyce within them, and small seede, flat on
the one side, with an hole or dent therein: this is seene in those
branches that are not cut, but suffered to beare out their flowers and
fruit.


        The Place.

        This bush groweth as plentifully in the Woods of our owne
        Countrey, as in any other beyond the Seas.


        The Time.

        It flowreth sometimes in Iune,and in Iuly; the fruit is ripe in
        August and September.


        The Names.

        There is great controuersie among the moderne Writers
        concerning this plant, some taking it to be κύπρος of
        Dioscorides, other to be _Phillyrea_ of Dioscorides, which
        followeth next after _Cyprus_. Plinie maketh mention of
        _Cyprus_ in two places; in the one he saith _Cyprus_ hath
        the leafe of _Ziziphus_, or the Iuiube tree: in the other
        he saith, that certain do affirme, that the _Cyprus_ of the
        East Country, and the _Ligustrum_ of Italy is one and the same
        plant: whereby you may plainly see, that our Priuet which is
        _Ligustrum_, cannot be that _Cyprus_ of Plinie with Iuiube
        leaues: Besides, both Dioscorides & Plinie say, that _Cyprus_
        is a tree; but all know that _Ligustrum_, Priuet, is but an
        hedge bush: Againe, Dioscorides saith, that the leaues of
        _Cyprus_ giue a red colour, but Priuet giueth none. Bellonius
        and Prosper Alpinus haue both recorded, that the true _Cyprus_
        of Dioscorides groweth plentifully in Egypt, Syria, and those
        Easterne Countries, and noursed vp also in Constantinople,
        and other parts of Greece, being a merchandise of much worth,
        in that they transport the leaues, and young branches dryed,
        which laid in water giue a yellow colour, wherewith the Turkish
        women colour the nailes of their hands, and some other parts
        of their bodies likewise, delighting much therein: and that it
        is not our _Ligustrum_, or Priuet, because _Cyprus_ beareth
        round white seede, like Coriander seede, and the leaues abide
        greene alwaies vpon the tree, which groweth (if it bee not
        cut or pruined) to the height of the Pomegranet tree. I haue
        (I confesse) beyond the limits I set for this worke spoken
        concerning our Priuet, because I haue had the seede of the true
        _Cyprus_ of Dioscorides sent mee, which was much differing from
        our Priuet, and although it sprang vp, yet would not abide any
        time, whereas if it had beene our Priuet, it would haue beene
        familiar enough to our Countrey.


        The Vertues.

        It is of small vse in physicke, yet some doe vse the leaues in
        Lotions, that serue to coole and dry fluxes or sores in diuers
        parts.




CHAP. CXXVI.

_Saluia variegata._   Party coloured Sage. And
_Maiorana versicolor siue aurea._   Yellow or golden Marierome.


Vnto all these flowers of beauty and rarity, I must adioyne two other
plants, whose beauty consisteth in their leaues, and not in their
flowers: as also to separate them from the others of their tribe, to
place them here in one Chapter, before the sweete herbes that shall
follow, as is fittest to furnish this our Garden of pleasure. This
kinde of Sage groweth with branches and leaues, very like the ordinary
Sage, but somewhat smaller, the chiefest difference consisteth in the
colour of the leaues, being diuersly marked and spotted with white and
red among the greene: for vpon one branch you shall haue the leaues
seuerally marked one from another, as the one halfe of the leafe white,
and the other halfe greene, with red shadowed ouer them both, or more
white then greene, with some red in it, either parted or shadowed, or
dasht here and there, or more greene then white, and red therein eyther
in the middle or end of the leafe, or more or lesse parted or striped
with white and red in the greene, or else sometimes wholly greene the
whole branch together, as nature listeth to play with such varieties:
which manner of growing rising from one and the same plant, because it
is the more variable, is the more delightfull and much respected.

There is another speckled Sage parted with white and greene, but it
is nothing of that beauty to this, because this hath three colours
euidently to bee discerned in euery leafe almost, the red adding a
superaboundant grace to the rest.


_Maiorana aurea siue versicolor._   Yellow or golden Marierome.

This kinde of Marierome belongeth to that sort is called in Latine
_Maiorana latifolia_, which Lobel setteth forth for _Hyssopus Græcorum
genuina_: In English Winter Marierome, or pot Marierome: for it hath
broader and greater leaues then the sweete Marierome, and a different
vmbell or tuft of flowers. The difference of this from that set forth
in the Kitchin Garden, consisteth chiefly in the leaues, which are in
Summer wholly yellow in some, or but a little greene, or parted with
yellow and greene more or lesse, as nature listeth to play: but in
Winter they are of a darke or dead greene colour, yet recouering it
selfe againe: the sent hereof is all one with the pot Marierome.

Wee haue another parted with white and greene, much after the manner
with the former.


          The Place, Time, Names, and Vertues of both these plants,
        shall be declared where the others of their kindes are
        specified hereafter, and in the Kitchen Garden; for they differ
        not in properties.




CHAP. CXXVII.

_Lauendula._   Lauender Spike.


After all these faire and sweete flowers before specified, I must
needes adde a few sweete herbes, both to accomplish this Garden, and to
please your senses, by placing them in your Nosegays, or else where, as
you list. And although I bring them in the end or last place, yet are
they not of the least account.


1. _Lauendula maior._   Garden Lauender.

Our ordinary Garden Lauender riseth vp with a hard wooddy stemme aboue
the ground, parted into many small branches, whereon are set whitish,
long, and narrow leaues, by couples one against another; from among
which riseth vp naked square stalkes, with two leaues at a ioynt, and
at the toppe diuers small huskes standing round about them, formed in
long and round heads or spikes, with purple gaping flowers springing
out of each of them: the roote is wooddy, and spreadeth in the ground:
The whole plant is of a strong sweete sent, but the heads of flowers
much more, and more piercing the senses, which are much vsed to bee put
among linnen and apparrell.

[Sidenote: _Flore albo._]

There is a kinde hereof that beareth white flowers, and somewhat
broader leaues, but it is very rare, and seene but in few places with
vs, because it is more tender, and will not so well endure our cold
Winters.


2. _Lauendula minor seu Spica._ Small Lauender or Spike.

The Spike or small Lauender is very like vnto the former, but groweth
not so high, neither is the head or spike so great and long, but
shorter and smaller, and of a more purplish colour in the flower: the
leaues also are a little harder, whiter, and shorter then the former;
the sent also is somewhat sharper and stronger. This is not so frequent
as the first, and is nourished but in some places that are warme, and
where they delight in rare herbes and plants.


        The Place.

        Lauender groweth in Spaine aboundantly, in many places so
        wilde, and little regarded, that many haue gone, and abiden
        there to distill the oyle thereof whereof great quantity now
        commeth ouer from thence vnto vs: and also in Lanquedocke, and
        Prouence in France.


        The Time.

        It flowreth early in those hot Countries, but with vs not
        vntill Iune and Iuly.


        The Names.

        It is called of some _Nardus Italica_, and _Lauendula_, the
        greater is called _Fæmina_, and the lesser _Mas_. We doe call
        them generally Lauender, or Lauender Spike, and the lesser
        Spike, without any other addition.


        The Vertues.

        Lauender is little vsed in inward physicke, but outwardly; the
        oyle for cold and benummed parts, and is almost wholly spent
        with vs, for to perfume linnen, apparrell, gloues, leather, &c.,
        and the dryed flowers to comfort and dry vp the moisture of a
        cold braine.




CHAP. CXXVIII.

_Stœchas._   Sticadoue, Cassidony, or French Lauender.


Cassidony that groweth in the Gardens of our Countrey, may peraduenture
somewhat differ in colour, as well as in strength, from that which
groweth in hotter Countries; but as it is with vs, it is more tender
a great deale then Lauender, and groweth rather like an herbe then a
bush or shrub, not aboue a foote and a halfe high, or thereabouts,
hauing many narrow long greene leaues like Lauender, but softer and
smaller, set at seuerall distances together about the stalkes, which
spread abroad into branches: at the tops whereof stand long and round,
and sometimes foure square heads, of a darke greenish purple colour,
compact of many scales set together; from among which come forth the
flowers, of a blewish purple colour, after which follow seede vessels,
which are somewhat whitish when they are ripe, containing blackish
browne seede within them: the roote is somewhat wooddy, and will hardly
abide the iniuries of our cold Winters, except in some places onely, or
before it haue flowred: The whole plant is somewhat sweete, but nothing
so much as Lauender.


        The Place.

        Cassidony groweth in the Islands Stæchades, which are ouer
        against Marselles, and in Arabia also: we keep it with great
        care in our Gardens.


        The Time.

        It flowreth the next yeare after it is sowne, in the end of
        May, which is a moneth before any Lauender.


        The Names.

        It is called of some _Lauendula siluestris_, but most vsually
        _Stæchas_ in English, of some Stichadoue, or French Lauender;
        and in many parts of England, Cassidony.


        The Vertues.

        It is of much more vse in physicke then Lauender, and is much
        vsed for old paines in the head. It is also held to be good
        for to open obstructions, to expell melancholy, to cleanse
        and strengthen the liuer, and other inward parts, and to be a
        Pectorall also.




CHAP. CXXIX.

_Abrotanum fæmina siue Santolina._   Lauender Cotton.


This Lauender Cotton hath many wooddy, but brittle branches, hoary or
of a whitish colour, whereon are set many leaues, which are little,
long, and foure square, dented or notched on all edges, and whitish
also: at the tops of these branches stand naked stalkes, bearing on
euery one of them a larger yellow head or flower, then eyther Tansie or
Maudeline, whereunto they are somewhat like, wherein is contained small
darke coloured seede: the roote is hard, and spreadeth abroad with many
fibres: the whole plant is of a strong sweete sent, but not vnpleasant,
and is in many places planted in Gardens, to border knots with, for
which it will abide to be cut into what forme you thinke best; for it
groweth thicke and bushy, very fit for such workes, besides the comely
shew the plant it selfe thus wrought doth yeeld, being alwayes greene,
and of a sweet sent; but because it quickly groweth great, and will
soone runne out of forme, it must be euery second or third yeare taken
vp, and new planted.


        The Place.

        It is onely planted in Gardens with vs, for the vses aforesaid
        especially.


        The Time.

        It flowreth in Iuly, and standeth long in the hot time of the
        yeare in his colour, and so will doe, if it be gathered before
        it haue stood ouer long.


        The Names.

        Diuers doe call it as Matthiolus doth, _Abrotanum fæmina_, and
        _Santolina_; and some call it _Chamæcyparissus_, because the
        leaues thereof, are somewhat like the leaues of the Cypresse
        tree: Wee call it in English generally Lauender Cotton.


        The Vertues.

        This is vsually put among other hot herbes, eyther into bathes,
        ointments, or other things, that are vsed for cold causes. The
        seede also is much vsed for the wormes.




CHAP. CXXX.

_Ocimum._   Bassill.


Bassill is of two sorts (besides other kindes) for this our Garden, the
one whereof is greater, the other lesse in euery part thereof; as shall
be shewed.


1. _Ocimum Citratum._   Common Bassill.

Our ordinary Garden Bassill hath one stalke rising from the root,
diuersly branched out, whereon are set two leaues alwayes at a ioynt,
which are broad, somewhat round, and pointed, of a pale greene colour,
but fresh, a little snipt or dented about the edges, and of a strong or
heady sent, somewhat like a Pomecitron, as many haue compared it, and
thereof call it _Citratum_: the flowers are small and white, standing
at the tops of the branches, with two smal leaues at euery ioynt vnder
them, in some plants green, in others browne vnder them: after which
commeth blacke seede: the roote perisheth at the first approach of
winter weather, and is to be new sowen euery yeare.


2. _Ocimum minimum siue Gariophyllatum._   Bush Basill.

The bush Basill groweth not altogether so high, but is thicker spreade
out into branches, whereon grow smaller leaues, and thicker set then
the former, but of a more excellent and pleasant smell by much: the
flowers are white like the former, and the seede blacke also like
it, and perisheth as suddenly, or rather sooner then it, so that it
requireth more paines to get it, and more care to nourse it, because we
seldome or neuer haue any seede of it.


_Ocimum Indicum._   Indian Basill.

The Indian Basill hath a square reddish greene stalke, a foote high
or better, from the ioynts whereof spreade out many branches, with
broade flat leaues set thereon, two alwayes together at the ioynt, one
against another, as other Basils haue, but somewhat deepely cut in on
the edges, and oftentimes a little crumpled, standing vpon long reddish
footestalkes, of a darke purple colour, spotted with deeper purple
spots, in some greater, in others lesser: the flowers stand at the tops
of the stalkes spike-fashion, which are of a white colour, with reddish
stripes and veines running through them, set or placed in darke purple
coloured huskes: the seede is greater and rounder then the former, and
somewhat long withall: the roote perisheth in like manner as the other
former doe. The whole plant smelleth strong, like vnto the other Basils.


        The Place.

        The two last sorts of Basils are greater strangers in our
        Country then the first which is frequent, and only sowen and
        planted in curious gardens. The last came first out of the West
        Indies.


        The Time.

        They all flower in August, or Iuly at the soonest, and that but
        by degrees, and not all at once.


        The Names.

        The first is vsually called _Ocimum vulgare_, or _vulgatius_,
        and _Ocimum Citratum_. In English, Common or Garden Basill.
        The other is called _Ocimum minimum_, or _Gariophyllatum_,
        Cloue Basill, or Bush Basill. The last eyther of his place,
        or forme of his leaues, being spotted and curled, or all, is
        called _Ocimum Indicum maculatum_, _latifolium_ & _crispum_. In
        English according to the Latine, Indian Basill, broade leafed
        Basill, spotted or curled Basill, which you please.


        The Vertues.

        The ordinary Basill is in a manner wholly spent to make sweet,
        or washing waters, among other sweet herbes, yet sometimes it
        is put into nosegayes. The Physicall properties are, to procure
        a cheerefull and merry heart, whervnto the seede is chiefly
        vsed in pouder, &c. and is most vsed to that, and to no other
        purpose.

CHAP. CXXXI.

_Maiorana._   Sweete Marierome.


Wee haue many sorts of Marierome; some that are sweete, and but Summer
plants; others that are greater and not so sweet; and some also that
are wilde. Of all these I will onely select some of the choisest that
are fit for this place, and leaue the other for the next garden, and
the garden of simples, or a generall worke: yet hereunto I will adioyne
another sweete plant called Masticke, as participating neerer with them
then with Time, whereunto many doe referre it.


1. _Maiorana maior æstiua._   Common sweet Marierome.

The sweet Marierome that is most frequently sowen in our Country, is a
low herbe little aboue a foote high when it is at the highest, full of
branches, and small whitish soft roundish leaues, smelling very sweet:
at the toppes of the branches stand diuers small scaly heads, like vnto
knots, (and therefore of some called knotted Marierome) of a whitish
greene colour, out of which come here and there small white flowers,
and afterwards small reddish seede: the roote is composed of many small
threds or strings, which perish with the whole plant euery yeare.


2. _Maiorana tenuifolia._   Marierome gentle.

This Marierome hath likewise diuers small branches, growing low, and
not higher then the former, but hauing finer and smaller leaues, hoary
and soft, but much sweeter: the heads are like vnto the former, and so
are the flowers and seede, and the whole plant abiding but a Summer in
the like manner.


3. _Marum._   Herbe Masticke.

The neerer resemblance that this herbe hath with Marierome then with
Tyme (as I said before) hath made me place it next vnto the small sweet
Marierome. It riseth vp with a greater, and a more woody stalke then
Marierome, two foote high or better in some places, where it liketh
the ground and ayre, branching out on all sides towards the vpper
part, leauing the stemme bare below, if it bee old, otherwise being
young, thinly furnishing the branches from the bottome with small
greene leaues, bigger then the leaues of any Tyme, and comming neere
vnto the bignesse and forme of the last recited finer Marierome, but
of a greener colour: at the toppes of the branches stand small white
flowers on a head, which afterwards turne into a loose tuft of a long
white hoary matter, like vnto soft doune, with some leaues vnderneath
and about it, which abide not long on the stalkes, but are blowne away
with the winde: the seede is so small if it haue any, that I haue not
obserued it: the roote is threddy: the whole plant is of a sweete
resinous sent, stronger then the Marierome, and abideth our winters, if
it be carefully planted and regarded.


        The Place.

        The sweete Marieromes grow naturally in hot Countreyes: the
        first in Spaine &c. the second is thought to come out of Syria,
        or Persia first into Italie, where they much esteeme it, and
        plant it curiously and carefully in pots, and set them in their
        windowes, beeing much delighted therewith for the sweet sent it
        hath. The first is vsually sowen euery yeare in most gardens
        with vs: but the second is very rare and daintie, and must as
        daintely be preserued being more tender then the former. The
        herbe Masticke is thought to be first brought out of Candie,
        Clusius saith he found it in Spaine: It is planted by slippes,
        (and not sowen) in many gardens, and is much replanted for
        increase, but prospereth onely, or more frequently, in loamie
        or clay grounds then in any other soyle.


        The Time.

        The sweete Marieromes beare their knots or scaly heads in the
        end of Iuly, or in August. Herbe Masticke in Iune many times,
        or in the beginning of Iuly.


        The Names.

        The first of the two sweet Marieromes called _Maiorana_ in
        Latine _à maiore cura_, is taken of most writers to be the
        _Amaracus_ or _Sampsuchum_ of Dioscorides, Theophrastus and
        Plinie, although Galen doth seem a little to dissent therefrom.
        The other sweet Marierome hath his name in his title as much
        as can be said of it. The next is thought by the best of the
        moderne Writers to be the true _Marum_ that Galen preferreth
        for the excellent sweetnesse, before the former Marierome in
        making the _Oleum_, or _vnguentum Amaricinum_, and seemeth to
        incline to their opinion that thought _Amaracus_ was deriued
        from _Marum_. It is the same also that Galen and others of the
        ancient Writers make mention of, to go into the composition
        of the _Trochisci Hedychroi_, as well as _Amaracus_ among the
        ingredients of the _Theriaca Andromachi_. In English we call it
        Masticke simply, or Herbe Mastick, both to distinguish it from
        that Tyme that is called Masticke Tyme, and from the Masticke
        Tree, or Gum, so called. Some of later times, and Clusius with
        them, haue thought this to be Dioscorides his _Tragoriganum_,
        which doth somewhat resemble it: but there is another plant
        that Matthiolus setteth forth for _Marum_, that in Lobels
        opinion and mine is the truest _Tragoriganum_, and this the
        truest _Marum_.


        The Vertues.

        The sweete Marieromes are not onely much vsed to please the
        outward senses in nosegayes, and in the windowes of houses,
        as also in sweete pouders, sweete bags, and sweete washing
        waters, but are also of much vse in Physicke, both to comfort
        the outward members, or parts of the body, and the inward also:
        to prouoke vrine being stopped, and to ease the paines thereof,
        and to cause the feminine courses. Herbe Masticke is of greater
        force to helpe the stopping of vrine, then the Marierome, and
        is put into Antidotes, as a remedie against the poyson of
        venemous Beasts.




CHAP. CXXXI.

_Thymum._   Tyme.


There are many kindes of Tyme, as they are vsually called, with vs,
some are called of the garden, and others wilde, which yet for their
sweetnesse are brought into gardens, as Muske Tyme, and Lemon Tyme; and
some for their beauty, as embroidered or gold yellow Tyme, and white
Tyme. But the true Tyme of the ancient Writers, called _Capitatum_, as
a speciall note of distinction from all other kindes of Tyme, is very
rare to be seene with vs here in England, by reason of the tendernesse,
that it will not abide our Winters. And all the other sorts that with
vs are called garden Tymes, are indeede but kindes of wilde Tyme,
although in the defect or want of the true Tyme, they are vsed in the
stead of it. With the Tymes I must doe as I did with the Marieromes in
the Chapter before, that is, reserue the most common in vse, for the
common vse of the Kitchen, and shew you only those here, that are not
put to that vse: and first with the true Tyme, because it is knowne but
to a few.


1. _Thymum legitimum capitatum._   The true Tyme.

The true Tyme is a very tender plant, hauing hard and hoary brittle
branches, spreading from a small wooddy stemme, about a foote and a
halfe high, whereon are set at seuerall ioynts, and by spaces, many
small, long, whitish, or hoary greene leaues, of a quicke sent and
taste: at the tops of the branches stand small long whitish greene
heads, somewhat like vnto the heads of _Stæchas_, made as it were of
many leaues or scales, out of which start forth small purplish flowers
(and in some white, as Bellonius saith) after which commeth small
seede, that soone falleth out, and if it be not carefully gathered,
is soone lost, which made (I thinke) Theophrastus to write, that this
Tyme was to be sowne of the flowers, as not hauing any other seede: the
root is small and wooddy. This holdeth not his leaues in Winter, no
not about Seuill in Spaine, where it groweth aboundantly, as Clusius
recordeth, finding it there naked or spoiled of leaues. And will not
abide our Winters, but perisheth wholly, roote and all.


2. _Serpillum hortense siue maius._   Garden wilde Tyme.

The wilde Tyme that is cherished in gardens groweth vpright, but yet
is lowe, with diuers slender branches, and small round greene leaues,
somewhat like vnto small fine Marierome, and smelling somewhat like
vnto it: the flowers growe in roundels at the toppes of the branches,
of a purplish colour: And in another of this kinde they are of a pure
white colour.

There is another also like hereunto, that smelleth somewhat like vnto
Muske; and therefore called Muske Tyme, whose greene leaues are not so
small as the former, but larger and longer.


3. _Serpillum Citratum._   Lemon Tyme.

The wilde Tyme that smelleth like vnto a Pomecitron or Lemon, hath many
weake branches trayling on the ground, like vnto the first described
wilde Tyme, with small darke greene leaues, thinly or sparsedly set
on them, and smelling like vnto a Lemon, with whitish flowers at the
toppes in roundels or spikes.


4. _Serpillum aureum siue versicolor._   Guilded or embroidered Tyme.

This kinde of wilde Tyme hath small hard branches lying or leaning
to the ground, with small party coloured leaues vpon them, diuided
into stripes or edges, of a gold yellow colour, the rest of the leafe
abiding greene, which for the variable mixture or placing of the
yellow, hath caused it to be called embroidered or guilded Tyme.


        The Place.

        The first groweth as is said before, about Seuill in Spaine, in
        very great aboundance as Clusius saith; and as Bellonius saith,
        very plentifully on the mountaines through all Greece. The
        others growe some in this Country, and some in others: but wee
        preserue them with all the care wee can in our gardens, for the
        sweete and pleasant sents and varieties they yeeld.


        The Time.

        The first flowreth not vntill August; the rest in Iune and Iuly.


        The Names.

        Their names are seuerally set downe in their titles, as is
        sufficient to distinguish them; and therefore I shall not neede
        to trouble you any further with them.


        The Vertues.

        The true Tyme is a speciall helpe to melancholicke and
        spleneticke diseases, as also to flatulent humours, either
        in the vpper or lower parts of the body. The oyle that is
        Chimically drawne out of ordinary Tyme, is vsed (as the whole
        herbe is, in the stead of the true) in pils for the head and
        stomach. It is also much vsed for the toothach, as many other
        such like hot oyles are.




CHAP. CXXXII.

_Hyssopus._   Hyssope.


There are many varieties of Hyssope, beside the common or ordinary,
which I reserue for the Kitchen garden, and intend onely in this place
to giue you the knowledge of some more rare: _viz._ of such as are
noursed vp by those that are curious, and fit for this garden: for
there are some other, that must be remembred in the Physicke garden, or
Garden of Simples, or else in a generall worke.


1. _Hyssopus folijs niueis._   White Hyssope.

This white Hyssope is of the same kinde and smell with the common
Hyssope; but differeth, in that this many times hath diuers leaues,
that are wholly of a white colour, with part of the stalke also: others
are parted, the one halfe white, the other halfe greene, and some
are wholly greene, or with some spots or stripes of white within the
greene, which makes it delightfull to most Gentlewomen.


2. _Hyssopus folijs cinereis._   Russet Hyssope.

As the last hath party coloured leaues, white and greene, so this hath
his leaues of an ash-colour, which of some is called russet; and hath
no other difference either in forme or smell.


3. _Hyssopus aureus._   Yellow or golden Hyssope.

All the leaues of this Hyssope are wholly yellow, or but a little
greene in them, and are of so pleasant a colour, especially in Summer,
that they prouoke many Gentlewomen to weare them in their heads, and on
their armes, with as much delight as many fine flowers can giue: but
in Winter their beautifull colour is much decayed, being of a whitish
greene, yet recouer themselues againe the next Summer.


4. _Hyssopus surculis densis._   Double Hyssope.

As this kinde of Hyssope groweth lower then the former or ordinary
kinde, so it hath more branches, slenderer, and not so wooddy, leaning
somewhat downe toward the ground, so wonderfully thicke set with
leaues, that are like vnto the other, but of a darker greene colour,
and somewhat thicker withall, that it is the onely fine sweete herbe,
that I know fittest (if any be minded to plant herbes) to set or border
a knot of herbes or flowers, because it will well abide, and not growe
too wooddy or great, nor be thinne of leaues in one part, when it is
thicke in another, so that it may be kept with cutting as smooth and
plaine as a table. If it be suffered to growe vp of it selfe alone, it
riseth with leaues as before is specified, and flowreth as the common
doth, and of the same sent also, not differing in any thing, but in the
thicknesse of the leaues on the stalkes and branches, and the aptnesse
to be ordered as the keeper pleaseth.


_Chamædrys._   Germander.

Lest Germander should be vtterly forgotten, as not worthy of our
Garden, seeing many (as I said in my treatise or introduction to this
Garden) doe border knots therewith: let me at the least giue it a
place, although the last, being more vsed as a strewing herbe for the
house, then for any other vse. It is (I thinke) sufficiently knowne to
haue many branches, with small and somewhat round endented leaues on
them, and purplish gaping flowers: the rootes spreading far abroad, and
rising vp againe in many places.


        The Place.

        These Hyssopes haue beene most of them noursed vp of long time
        in our English Gardens, but from whence their first originall
        should be, is not well knowne. The Germander also is onely in
        Gardens, and not wilde.


        The Time.

        They flower in Iune and Iuly.


        The Names.

        The seuerall names whereby they are knowne to vs, are set
        forth in their titles; and therefore I neede not here say
        more of them then onely this, that neyther they here set
        downe, nor the common or ordinary sort, nor any of the rest
        not here expressed, are any of them the true Hyssope of the
        ancient Greeke Writers, but _supposititiæ_, vsed in the stead
        thereof. The Germander, from the forme of the leaues like vnto
        small oaken leaues, had the name _Chamædrys_ giuen it, which
        signifieth a dwarfe Oake.


        The Vertues.

        The common Hyssope is much vsed in all pectorall medicines,
        to cut fleagme, and to cause it easily to be auoided. It is
        vsed of many people in the Country, to be laid vnto cuts or
        fresh wounds, being bruised, and applyed eyther alone, or with
        a little Sugar. It is much vsed as a sweet herbe, to be in
        the windowes of an house. I finde it much commended against
        the Falling Sicknesse, especially being made into Pils after
        this manner: Of Hyssope, Horhound, and Castor, of each halfe
        a dramme, of Peony rootes (the male kinde is onely fit to be
        vsed for this purpose) two drams, of _Assafætida_ one scruple:
        Let them be beaten, and made into pils with the iuyce of
        Hyssope; which being taken for seuen dayes together at night
        going to bed, is held to be effectual to giue much ease, if
        not thoroughly to cure those that are troubled with that
        disease. The vse of Germander ordinarily is as Tyme, Hyssope,
        and other such herbes, to border a knot, whereunto it is often
        appropriate, and the rather, that it might be cut to serue (as
        I said) for a strewing herbe for the house among others. For
        the physicall vse it serueth in diseases of the splene, and the
        stopping of vrine, and to procure womens courses.

       *       *       *       *       *

Thus haue I led you through all my Garden of Pleasure, and shewed you
all the varieties of nature noursed therein, pointing vnto them, and
describing them one after another. And how lastly (according to the vse
of our old ancient Fathers) I bring you to rest on the Grasse, which
yet shall not be without some delight, and that not the least of all
the rest.

CHAP. CXXXIII.

_Gramina._   Grasses.


There are among an infinite number (as I may so say) of Grasses, a few
onely which I thinke fit to be planted in this Garden, both for the
rarity of them, and also for your delight, and the excellent beauty
that is in them aboue many other plants. One of them hath long agoe bin
respected, and cherished in the country gardens of many Gentlewomen,
and others. The others are knowne but vnto a few.


1. _Gramen striatum._   Painted Grasse or Ladies laces.

This kinde of Grasse hath many stiffe, hard, round stalkes, full of
ioynts, whereon are set at euery ioynt one long leafe, somewhat broad
at the bottome, where it compasseth the stalke, and smaller to the end,
where it is sharpe pointed, hard or rough in handling, and striped all
the length of the leafe with white streakes or lines, that they seeme
party coloured laces of white and greene: the tops of the stalkes are
furnished with long spikie tufts, like vnto the tufts of Couch Grasse:
the rootes are small, white, and threddy, like the rootes of other
Grasses.


2. _Gramen Plumarium minus._   The lesser Feather-Grasse.

This lesser Feather-Grasse hath many small, round, and very long
leaues or blades, growing in tufts, much finer and smaller then any
other Grasse that I know, being almost like vnto haires, and of a
fresh greene colour in Summer, but changing into gray, like old hay in
Winter, being indeede all dead, and neuer reuiuing; yet hardly to be
plucked away vntill the Spring, and then other greene leaues or rushes
rise vp by them, and in their stead, and are aboue a foote in length:
from the middle of these tufts come forth rounder and bigger rushes,
which are the stalkes, and which haue a chaffie round eare about the
middle thereof, which when it is full growne, is somewhat higher then
the toppes of the leaues or rushes, opening it selfe (being before
close) at the top, and shewing forth three or foure long ayles or
beards, one aboue another, which bend themselues a little downewards
(if they stand ouer long before they are gathered, and will fall off,
and be blowne away with the winde) being so finely feathered on both
sides, all the length of the beard, and of a pale or grayish colour,
that no feather in the taile of the Bird of Paradise can be finer,
or to be compared with them, hauing sticking at the end of euery one
of them, within the eare, a small, long, whitish, round, hard, and
very sharpe pointed graine, like vnto an oaten graine, that part of
the stalke of the feather that is next vnder it, and aboue the seede
for some two or three inches, being stiffe and hard, and twining or
curling it selfe, if it be suffered to stand too long, or to fall away,
otherwise being straight as the feather it selfe: the roote is composed
of many long, hard, small threddy strings, which runne deepe and far,
and will not willingly be remoued, in that it gaineth strength euery
yeare by standing.


3. _Gramen Plumarium maius._   The greater Feather-Grasse.

The greater Feather-Grasse is like vnto the lesser, but that both the
leaues and the feathers, are greater, and nothing so fine, grosser
also, and of lesse beauty and respect, though whiter then it; and
therefore is not so much regarded: for I haue knowne, that many
Gentlewomen haue vsed the former lesser kinde, being tyed in tufts, to
set them in stead of feathers about their beds, where they haue lyen
after childe-bearing, and at other times also, when as they haue been
much admired of the Ladies and Gentles that haue come to visit them.


        The Place.

        The first of these Grasses, as Lobel saith, groweth naturally
        in the woods and hils of Sauoy. It hath long agoe beene
        receiued into our English gardens. The second, as Clusius
        saith, in Austria, from whence also (as I take it) the greater
        came, and are both in the gardens of those, that are curious
        obseruers of these delights.


        The Time.

        The first is in its pride for the leaues all the Spring and
        Summer, yeelding his bush in Iune. The other giue their
        feather-like sprigs in Iuly and August, and quickly (as I said)
        are shed, if they be not carefully gathered.


        The Names.

        The first is called by Lobel _Gramen sulcatum_, or _striatum
        album_; of others _Gramen pictum_. The French call it
        _Aiguellettes d’armes_, of the fashion that their Ensignes,
        Pennons, or Streamers vsed in wars were of, that is, like vnto
        a party coloured curtaine. In English vsually Ladies laces,
        and Painted Grasse. The first of the other two is called
        _Gramen plumarium_ or _plumosum_, and _minus_ is added for the
        distinction of it. Clusius calleth it _Spartum Austriacum_,
        of the likenesse and place where he found it. The last is,
        called _Gramen plumarium_, or _plumosum maius_, The greater
        Feather-Grasse.


        The Vertues.

        These kindes of Grasses are not in any time or place that I doe
        heare of applyed to any Physicall vse; and therefore of them I
        will say no more: but here I will end the prime part of this
        worke.




THE ORDERING OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN.




CHAP. I.

_The situation of a Kitchen Garden, or Garden of Herbes, and what sort
of manure is fittest to helpe the decaying of the soyle thereof._


Hauing giuen you the best rules and instructions that I can for your
flower Garden, and all the flowers that are fit to furnish it, I now
proceede to your herbe garden, which is not of the least respect
belonging to any mans house, nor vtterly to bee neglected for the
many vtilities are to be had from it, both for the Masters profit
and pleasure, and the meynies content and nourishment: all which if
I should here set down, I had a large field to wander in, and matter
sufficient to entreat of, but this worke permitteth not that libertie:
and I thinke there are but few but eyther know it already, or conceiue
it sufficiently in their minds. Passing therefore no further in such
discourses, I come to the matter in hand, which is to shew you where
the fittest place is for an herbe garden. As before I shewed you that
the beautie of any worthy house is much the more commended for the
pleasant situation of the garden of flowers, or of pleasure, to be in
the sight and full prospect of all the chiefe and choisest roomes of
the house; so contrariwise, your herbe garden should bee on the one
or other side of the house, and those best and choyse roomes: for the
many different sents that arise from the herbes, as Cabbages, Onions,
&c. are scarce well pleasing to perfume the lodgings of any house; and
the many ouertures and breaches as it were of many of the beds thereof,
which must necessarily bee, are also as little pleasant to the sight.
But for priuate mens houses, who must like their habitations as they
fall vnto them, and cannot haue time or meanes to alter them, they must
make a vertue of necessity, and conuert their places to their best
aduantage, by making their profit their chiefest pleasure, and making
one place serue for all vses. The choyce of ground for this Garden, is
(as I said before) where it is fat, fertill and good, there needeth
the lesse labour and cost; and contrariwise, where it is cold, wet,
dry or barren, there must bee the more helpes still added to keepe
it in heart. For this Garden by reason of the much and continuall
stirring therein, the herbes and rootes drawing out the substance of
the fertilitie thereof more aboundantly then in the former, must be
continually holpen with soyle, or else few things of goodnesse or worth
will come forward therein. The stable soyle of horses is best and most
proper for any colde grounds, for being the hottest, it will cause any
the seedes for this Garden to prosper well, and be more forward then in
any other ground that is not so holpen. The stable soyle of Cattell is
of a colder and moister nature, and is therefore more proper for the
hot sandy or grauelly grounds, and although it bee longer before it bee
brought to mould then that of horses, yet it will outlast it more then
twice so long. Let euery one therefore take according to the nature
of the ground such helpes as are most fit and conuenient, as I haue
here and before shewed. But I doe here ingenuously confesse my opinion
of these forcings and helpings of ground, that howsoeuer it doth much
good to some particular things, which because they delight in heate,
and cannot be brought to perfection without it in this our Countrey,
which is colder then their naturall from whence they are brought, must
therefore haue artificiall helpes to forward them; yet for many other
things the compost doth much alter and abate the naturall vigour, and
quickenesse of taste, that is perceiued in them that grow in a naturall
fat or sandy soile that is not so holpen.




CHAP. II.

_The forme of a Garden of herbes for necessary vses, with the ordering
thereof._


As our former Garden of pleasure is wholly formable in euery part with
squares, trayles, and knots, and to bee still maintained in their due
forme and beautie: so on the contrary side this Garden cannot long
conserue any forme, for that euery part thereof is subiect to mutation
and alteration. For although it is conuenient that many herbes doe grow
by themselues on beds, cast out into some proportion fit for them, as
Tyme, Hissope, Sage, &c. yet many others may bee sowen together on a
plot of ground of that largenesse that may serue euery mans particular
vse as he shall haue occasion to employ it, as Reddish, Lettice and
Onions, which after they are growne vp together may be drawne vp and
taken away, as there is occasion to spend them: but Carrots or Parsneps
being sowen with others must bee suffered to grow last, because
they require a longer time before they be fit to be taken vp. Other
herbes require some large compasse of ground whereon they may grow of
themselues without any other herbes growing among them, as Artichokes,
Cowcumbers, Melons, Pompions. And some will doe so with their Cabbages
also, but the best and most frugall way now vsed, is to plant them
round about the border of your plot or ground whereon you plant
Cowcumbers, Pompions, or other things, in that by this meanes so much
ground will be well saued, and the other things be no whit hindered
thereby, which else a great deale of ground must be employed for them
apart. So that by this that I haue here said, you may perceiue the
forme of this Garden is for the most part, to bee still out of forme
and order, in that the continuall taking vp of the herbes and rootes
that are sowen and planted, causeth the beds or parts of this Garden
to lye broken, dismembered, and out of the order that at the first it
was put into. Remember herewithall that (as I said before) this Garden
requireth the continuall helpe of soyle to be brought into it, in that
the plenty of these manner of herbes and rootes doe so much waste
the fertilitie and fatnesse of the ground, that without continuall
refreshing it would quickly become so poore and barren, that it would
not yeelde the worth of the seede. The ordinary time to soyle a Garden,
is to bring in manure or dung before Christmas, and eyther bury at some
small depth, not too deepe, or else to lay it vpon the ground that the
winter frostes may pierce it, and then turne it shallow into the ground
to sow your seeds in the Spring.




CHAP. III.

_How to order diuers Garden herbes, both for their sowing, spending,
and gathering of the seede._


Ovr chiefest and greatest Gardiners now adaies, doe so prouide for
themselues euery yeare, that from their owne grounds they gather the
seede of many herbes that they sowe againe: for hauing gained the
best kind of diuers herbes, they will be still furnished with the
same, and be not to seeke euery yeare for new that oftentimes will not
yeelde them halfe the profit that their choyce seede will: I say of
many herbes, but not of all; for the best of them all hath not ground
sufficient for all sorts, nor will our climate bring some to that
perfection that other forraine doth, and therefore the seede of some
things are continually brought from beyond Sea vnto vs. And againe
although our chiefe Gardiners doe still prouide their owne seede of
diuers things from their owne ground, because as I said it is of the
best kinde, yet you must vnderstand also, that good store of the same
sortes of seeds are brought from beyond the Seas, for that which is
gathered in this Land is not sufficient to serue euery mans vse in the
whole Kingdome by many parts; yet still it is true, that our English
seede of many things is better then any that commeth from beyond the
Seas: as for example, Reddish, Lettice, Carrots, Parsneps, Turneps,
Cabbages, and Leekes, of all which I intend to write in this place;
for these are by them so husbanded, that they doe not sow their owne
grounds with any other seede of these sorts but their owne: which
that you may know the manner how to doe, I will here set it downe,
that euery one may haue the best directions if they will follow them.
Of Reddish there are two sorts, one more early then the other: they
vse therefore to sow their early Reddish first, that they may haue
the earliest profit of them, which is more worth in one fortnight,
then in a moneth after. And to effect this they haue some artificiall
helps also; which are these: They vse to digge vp a large plot of
ground where they intend to sow their seede a little before or after
Christmas, casting it into high bankes or ridges fiue or sixe foote
asunder, which they suffer to lye and take all the extreame frosts
in Ianuary to mellow the earth, and when the frostes are past, they
then beginne to bring into it good store of fresh stable dung, which
they laye neyther too deepe nor too thicke, and couer it with the
mould a hand breadth thicknesse aboue the dung, which doth giue such
a warmth and comfort to whatsoeuer is sowen thereon, that it forceth
it forward much sooner then any other way can doe: And to preuent
both the frostes, and the cold bitter windes which often spoyle their
seede new sprung vp, they vse to set great high and large mattes made
of reedes, tyed together, and fastened vnto strong stakes, thrust
into the ground to keepe them vp from falling, or being blowne down
with the winde; which mattes they place on the North and East side to
breake the force of these winds, and are so sure and safe a defence,
that a bricke wall cannot better defend anything vnder it, then this
fence will. In this manner they doe euery yeare to bring forward their
seede to gaine the more by them, and they that will haue Reddish
early, must take the same course. The other sort of Reddish for the
most part is sowen in Februarie, a fortnight after the other at the
least, and likewise euery moneth after vnto September, that they may
haue young continually. For the blacke Reddish, although many in many
places doe sowe it in the same time, and in the same manner that the
ordinary is sowen, yet the nature thereof is to runne vp to seede more
speedily then the other, if it haue so rich ground to grow vpon, and
therefore the best time to sow it is in August, that so it may abide
all winter, therein is the chiefest time for the spending thereof, and
to keepe it vntill the beginning of the next yeare from running vp to
seed: the gathering whereof, as also of the other sort, is all after
one manner, that is, to be pulled vp when the pods change whitish, and
then hanged vpon bushes, pales, or such other thing, vntill they bee
thorough dry, and then beaten or thrashed out vpon a smooth plancher,
or vpon clothes, as euery ones store is, and their conueniencie.
Lettice is sowen oftentimes with the early Reddish, in the same manner
before said, that they may haue Lettice likewise as early as the time
of the year will permit them, which they pull vp where they grow
too thicke, spending them first, and so taking vp from time to time,
vntill they stand two foote in sunder one from another, and beginne
to spindle and shoote vp for seede. In this is vsed some arte to make
the plants strong to giue the better seede without danger of rotting
or spoyling with the wet, which often happeneth to those about whom
this caution is not obserued: Before your Lettice is shot vp, marke
out the choysest and strongest plantes which are fittest to grow for
seede, and from those when they are a foote high, strippe away with
your hand the leaues that grow lowest vpon the stalke next the ground,
which might rot, spoyle or hinder them from bearing so good seede;
which when it is neere to be ripe, the stalkes must be cut off about
the middle, and layde vpon mats or clothes in the Sunne, that it may
there fully ripen and be gathered; for it would be blowne away with the
winde if it should be suffered to abide on the stalkes long. Parsneps
must be sowen on a deep trenched mellow ground, otherwise they may run
to seede the first yeare, which then are nothing worth: or else the
rootes will be small staruelings and short, and runne into many spires
or branches, whereby they will not bee of halfe the worth. Some vse to
sow them in August and September, that so they may bee well growne to
serue to spend in Lent following, but their best time is in February,
that the Summers growth may make them the fairer and greater. When
they runne vp to seede you shall take the principall or middle heades,
for those carry the Master seede, which is the best, and will produce
the fairest rootes againe. You shall hardly haue all the seede ripe at
one instant, for vsually the chiefest heads will be fallen before the
other are ripe: you must therefore still looke them ouer, and cut them
as they ripen. Carrots are vsually sowen in March and Aprill, and if
it chance that some of them doe runne vp for seede the same year, they
are to be weeded out, for neyther the seed nor roots of them are good:
You must likewise pull them vp when they are too thicke, if you will
haue them grow fair, or for seed, that they may grow at the least three
or foure foot in sunder: the stalkes of Carrots are limber, and fall
downe to the ground; they must therefore be sustained by poles layde
acrosse on stalkes thrust into the ground, and tyed to the poles and
stalkes to keepe them vp from rotting or spoyling vpon the ground: the
seed hereof is not all ripe at once, but must be tended and gathered
as it ripeneth, and layd to dry in some dry chamber or floore, and
then beaten out with a stick, and winnowed from the refuse. Turneps
are sowne by themselues vpon a good ground in the end of Iuly, and
beginning of August, to haue their rootes best to spend in winter; for
it often happeneth that those seedes of Turneps that are sowen in the
Spring, runne vp to seede the same yeare, and then it is not accounted
good. Many doe vse to sow Turneps on those grounds from whence the same
yeare they haue taken off Reddish and Lettice, to make the greater
profit of the ground, by hauing two crops of increase in one yeare.
The stalkes of Turneps will bend downe to the ground, as Carrots doe,
but yet must not be bound or ordered in that manner, but suffered to
grow without staking or binding, so as they grow of some good distance
in sunder: when the seede beginneth to grow ripe, be very carefull to
preserue it from the birds, which will be most busie to deuour them.
You shall vnderstand likewise that many doe account the best way to
haue the fairest and most principall seede from all these fore-recited
herbes, that after they are sowen and risen to a reasonable growth,
they be transplanted into fresh ground. Cabbages also are not only
sowen for the vse of their heads to spend for meat, but to gather their
seede likewise, which howsoeuer some haue endeauoured to doe, yet few
haue gained good seede, because our sharpe hard frostes in winter haue
spoyled and rotted their stockes they preserued for the purpose; but
others haue found out a better and a more sure way, which is, to take
vp your stocks that are fittest to be preserued, and bring them into
the house, and there wrap them eyther in clothes, or other things to
defend them from the cold, and hang them vp in a dry place, vntill the
beginning of March following, then planting them in the ground, and
a little defend them at the first with straw cast ouer them from the
cold nights, thereby you may be sure to haue perfect good seede, if
your kinde be of the best: Sowe your seed in the moneths of February or
March, and transplant them in May where they may stand to grow for your
vse, but be carefull to kill the wormes or Caterpillers that else will
deuoure all your leaues, and be carefull also that none of the leaues
bee broken in the planting, or otherwise rubbed, for that oftentimes
hindereth the well closing of them. Leekes are for the most part
wholly noursed vp from the seede that is here gathered; and because
there is not so much store of them either sowne or spent, as there
is of Onions by the twentieth part, we are still the more carefull
to be prouided from our owne labours; yet there be diuers Gardiners
in this Kingdome, that doe gather some small quantity of Onion seede
also for their owne or their priuate friends spending. The sowing of
them both is much about one time and manner, yet most vsually Leeks
are sowne later then Onions, and both before the end of March at the
furthest; yet some sowe Onions from the end of Iuly to the beginning
of September, for their Winter prouision. Those that are sowne in the
Spring, are to be taken vp and transplanted on a fresh bed prepared
for the purpose, or else they will hardly abide a Winter; but hauing
taken roote before Winter, they will beare good seede in the Summer
following: You must stake both your Leekes and your Onion beds, and
with poles laid a crosse, binde your lopple headed stalkes vnto them,
on high as well as belowe, or else the winde and their owne weight
will beare them downe to the ground, and spoile your seede. You must
thinne them, that is, pull vp continually after they are first sprung
vp those that growe too thicke, as you doe with all the other herbes
before spoken of, that they may haue the more roome to thriue. Of all
these herbes and rootes before spoken of, you must take the likeliest
and fairest to keepe for your seede; for if you should not take the
best, what hope of good seede can you expect? The time for the spending
of these herbes and rootes, not particularly mentioned, is vntill they
begin to runne vp for seede, or vntill they are to be transplanted for
seede, or else vntill Winter, while they are good, as euery one shall
see cause.




CHAP. IIII.

_How to order Artichokes, Melons, Cowcumbers, and Pompions._


There are certaine other herbes to be spoken of, which are wholly
noursed vp for their fruit sake, of whom I shall not need to say much,
being they are so frequent in euery place. Artichokes being planted of
faire and large slips, taken from the roote in September and October
(yet not too late) will most of them beare fruit the next yeare, so
that they be planted in well dunged ground, and the earth raised vp
like vnto an Anthill round about each roote, to defend them the better
from the extreame frosts in Winter. Others plant slips in March and
Aprill, or sooner, but although some of them will beare fruit the
same yeare, yet all will not. And indeede many doe rather choose to
plant in the spring then in the fall, for that oftentimes an extreame
hard Winter following the new setting of slips, when they haue not
taken sufficient heart and roote in the ground, doth vtterly pierce
and perish them, when as they that are set in the Spring haue the
whole Summers growth, to make them strong before they feele any sharpe
frosts, which by that time they are the better able to beare. Muske
Melons haue beene begun to bee noursed vp but of late dayes in this
Land, wherein although many haue tryed and endeauoured to bring them to
perfection, yet few haue attained vnto it: but those rules and orders
which the best and skilfullest haue vsed, I will here set downe, that
who so will, may haue as good and ripe Melons as any other in this
Land. The first thing you are to looke vnto, is to prouide you a peece
of ground fit for the purpose, which is either a sloping or sheluing
banke, lying open and opposite to the South Sunne, or some other fit
place not sheluing, and this ground also you must so prepare, that all
the art you can vse about it to make it rich is little enough; and
therefore you must raise it with meere stable soyle, thorough rotten &
well turned vp, that it may be at the least three foote deepe thereof,
which you must cast also into high beds or balkes, with deepe trenches
or furrowes betweene, so as the ridges may be at the least a foot and
a halfe higher then the furrowes; for otherwise it is not possible to
haue good Melons growe ripe. The choise of your seede also is another
thing of especiall regard, and the best is held to be Spanish, and
not French, which hauing once gained, be sure to haue still of the
same while they last good, that you may haue the seede of your owne
ripe Melons from them that haue eaten them, or saue some of the best
your selfe for the purpose. I say while they last good; for many are
of opinion, that no seede of Muske Melons gathered in England, will
endure good to sowe againe here aboue the third yeare, but still they
must be renewed from whence you had your choisest before. Then hauing
prepared a hot bed of dung in Aprill, set your seedes therein to raise
them vp, and couer them, and order them with as great care or greater
then Cowcumbers, &c. are vsed, that when they are ready, they may be
transplanted vpon the beds or balkes of that ground you had before
prepared for them, and set them at the least two yards in sunder, euery
one as it were in a hole, with a circle of dung about them, which vpon
the setting being watered with water that hath stood in the Sunne a day
or two, and so as often as neede is to water, couer them with strawe
(some vse great hollow glasses like vnto bell heads) or some such other
things, to defend them both from the cold euenings or dayes, and the
heate of the Sunne, while they are young and new planted. There are
some that take vpon them great skill, that mislike of the raising vp
of Melons, as they doe also of Cowcumbers, on a hot bed of horse dung,
but will put two or three seedes in a place in the very ground where
they shall stand and growe, and thinke without that former manner of
forcing them forwards, that this their manner of planting will bring
them on fast and sure enough, in that they will plucke away some of the
worst and weakest, if too many rise vp together in a place; but let
them know for certaine, that howsoeuer for Cowcumbers their purpose and
order may doe reasonable well, where the ground is rich and good, and
where they striue not to haue them so early, as they that vse the other
way, for Muske Melons, which are a more tender fruit, requiring greater
care and trouble in the noursing, and greater and stronger heate for
the ripening, they must in our cold climate haue all the art vsed vnto
them that may be, to bring them on the more early, and haue the more
comfort of the Sunne to ripen them kindly, or else they will not bee
worth the labour and ground. After you haue planted them as aforesaid,
some of good skill doe aduise, that you be carefull in any dry season,
to giue them water twice or thrice euery weeke while they are young,
but more afterward when they are more growne, and that in the morning
especially, yea and when the fruit is growne somewhat great, to water
the fruit it selfe with a watering pot in the heate of the day, is of
so good effect, that it ripeneth them much faster, and will giue them
the better taste and smell, as they say. To take likewise the fruit,
and gather it at the full time of his ripenesse is no small art; for if
it be gathered before his due time to be presently eaten, it will be
hard and greene, and not eate kindly; and likewise if it be suffered
too long, the whole goodnesse will be lost: You shall therefore know,
that it is full time to gather them to spend presently, when they begin
to looke a little yellowish on the outside, and doe smell full and
strong; but if you be to send them farre off, or keepe them long vpon
any occasion, you shall then gather them so much the earlier, that
according to the time of the carriage and spending, they may ripen in
the lying, being kept dry, and couered with woollen clothes: When you
cut one to eate, you shall know it to be ripe and good, if the seede
and pulpe about them in the middle be very waterish, and will easily
be separated from the meate, and likewise if the meate looke yellow,
and be mellow, and not hard or greene, and taste full and pleasant,
and not waterish: The vsuall manner to eate them is with pepper and
salt, being pared and sliced, and to drowne them in wine, for feare of
doing more harme. Cowcumbers and Pompions, after they are noursed vp
in the bed of hot dung, are to be seuerally transplanted, each of them
on a large plot of ground, a good distance in sunder: but the Pompions
more, because their branches take vp a great deale more ground, &
besides, will require a great deale more watering, because the fruit is
greater. And thus haue you the ordering of those fruits which are of
much esteeme, especially the two former, with all the better sort of
persons; and the third kinde is not wholly refused of any, although it
serueth most vsually for the meaner and poorer sort of people, after
the first early ripe are spent.




CHAP. V.

_The ordering of diuers sorts of herbes for the pot, for meate, and for
the table._


Tyme, Sauory, and Hyssope, are vsually sowne in the Spring on beds by
themselues, euerie one a part; but they that make a gaine by selling to
others the young rootes, to set the knots or borders of Gardens, doe
for the most part sowe them in Iuly and August, that so being sprung
vp before Winter, they will be the fitter to be taken vp in the Spring
following, to serue any mans vse that would haue them. Sage, Lauender,
and Rosemary, are altogether set in the Spring, by slipping the old
stalkes, and taking the youngest and likeliest of them, thrusting them
either twined or otherwise halfe a foote deepe into the ground, and
well watered vpon the setting; if any seasonable weather doe follow,
there is no doubt of their well thriuing: the hot Sunne and piercing
drying Windes are the greatest hinderances to them; and therefore I
doe aduise none to set too soone in the Spring, nor yet in Autumne,
as many doe practise: for I could neuer see such come to good, for
the extremity of the Winter comming vpon them so soone after their
setting, will not suffer their young shootes to abide, not hauing taken
sufficient strength in the ground, to maintain themselues against such
violence, which doth often pierce the strongest plants. Marierome and
Bassill are sowne in the Spring, yet not too early; for they are tender
plants, and doe not spring vntill the weather bee somewhat warme: but
Bassill would bee sowne dry, and not haue any water of two or three
daies after the sowing, else the seede will turne to a gelly in the
ground. Some vse to sowe the seed of Rosemary, but it seldome abideth
the first Winter, because the young plants being small, and not of
sufficient strength, cannot abide the sharpnesse of some Winters,
notwithstanding the couering of them, which killeth many old plants;
but the vsuall way is to slippe and set, and so they thriue well.
Many doe vse to sowe all or the most sorts of Pot-herbes together on
one plot of ground, that they neede not to goe farre to gather all
the sorts they would vse. There are many sorts of them well knowne
vnto all, yet few or none doe vse all sorts, but as euery one liketh;
some vse those that others refuse, and some esteem those not to bee
wholesome and of a good rellish, which others make no scruple of. The
names of them are as followeth, and a short relation of their sowing or
planting.

Rosemary, Tyme, and Sauorie are spoken of before, and Onions, and
Leekes.

Mints are to bee set with their rootes in some by-place, for that their
rootes doe creepe so farre vnder ground, that they quickly fill vp the
places neare adioyning, if they be not puld vp.

Clarie is to be sowne, and seedeth and dyeth the next yeare, the herbe
is strong, and therefore a little thereof is sufficient.

Nep is sowne, and dyeth often after seeding, few doe vse it, and that
but a little at a time: both it and Clarie are more vsed in Tansies
then in Broths.

Costmarie is to be set of rootes, the leaues are vsed with some in
their Broths, but with more in their Ale.

Pot Marierome is set of rootes, being separated in sunder.

Penniroyall is to be set of the small heads that haue rootes, it
creepeth and spreadeth quickly.

Allisanders are to be sowne of seede, the tops of the rootes with the
greene leaues are vsed in Lent especially.

Parsley is a common herbe, and is sowne of seede, it seedeth the next
yeare and dyeth: the rootes are more vsed in broths then the leaues,
and the leaues almost with all sorts of meates.

Fennell is sowne of seede, and abideth many yeares yeelding seede; the
rootes also are vsed in broths, and the leaues more seldome, yet serue
to trimme vp many fish meates.

Borage is sowne of seede, and dyeth the next yeare after, yet once
being suffered to seede in a Garden, will still come of it owne
shedding.

Buglosse commeth of seede, but abideth many yeares after it hath giuen
seede, if it stand not in the coldest place of the Garden.

Marigolds are sowne of seede, and may be after transplanted, they abide
two or three yeares, if they be not set in too cold a place: the leaues
and flowers are both vsed.

Langedebeefe is sowne of seede, which shedding it selfe will hardly be
destroyed in a Garden.

Arrach is to be sowne of seede, this likewise will rise euery yeare of
it owne seed, if it be suffered to shed it selfe.

Beetes are sowne of seede, and abideth some yeares after, still giuing
seede.

Blites are vsed but in some places, for there is a generall opinion
held of them, that they are naught for the eyes: they are sowne euery
yeare of seede.

Bloodwort once sowne abideth many yeares, if the extremity of the
frosts kill it not, and seedeth plentifully.

Patience is of the same nature, and vsed in the same manner.

French Mallowes are to be sowne of seede, and will come of it owne
sowing, if it be suffered to shed it selfe.

Ciues are planted onely by parting the rootes; for it neuer giueth any
seede at all.

Garlicke is ordered in the same manner, by parting and planting the
rootes euerie yeare.

These be all the sorts are vsed with vs for that purpose, whereas I
said before, none vseth all, but euery one will vse those they like
best: and so much shall suffice for pot-herbes.




CHAP. VI.

_The manner and ordering of many sorts of herbes and rootes for
Sallets._


If I should set downe all the sorts of herbes that are vsually gathered
for Sallets, I should not onely speake of Garden herbes, but of many
herbes, &c. that growe wilde in the fields, or else be but weedes in
a Garden; for the vsuall manner with many, is to take the young buds
and leaues of euery thing almost that groweth, as well in the Garden
as in the Fields, and put them all together, that the taste of the one
may amend the rellish of the other: But I will only shew you those
that are sown or planted in gardens for that purpose. Asparagus is a
principall & delectable Sallet herbe, whose young shootes when they
are a good handfull high aboue the ground, are cut an inch within the
ground, which being boyled, are eaten with a little vinegar and butter,
as a Sallet of great delight. Their ordering with the best Gardiners
is on this wise: When you haue prouided seede of the best kinde, you
must sowe it either before Christmas, as most doe, or before the end
of February; the later you sowe, the later and the more hardly will
they spring: after they are growne vp, they are to be transplanted in
Autumne on a bed well trenched in with dung; for else they will not bee
worth your labour, and set about a foote distance in sunder, and looke
that the more carefull you are in the replanting of them, the better
they will thriue, and the sooner growe great: after fiue or six yeares
standing they vsually doe decay; and therefore they that striue to haue
continually faire and great heads, doe from seede raise vp young for
their store. You must likewise see that you cut not your heads or young
shoote too nigh, or too much, that is, to take away too many heads from
a roote, but to leaue a sufficient number vncut, otherwise it will kill
the heart of your rootes the sooner, causing them to dye, or to giue
very small heads or shootes; for you may well consider with your selfe,
that if the roote haue not head enough left it aboue the ground to
shoote greene this yeare, it will not, nor cannot prosper vnder ground
to giue encrease the next yeare. The ordering of Lettice I haue spoken
of before, and shall not neede here to repeate what hath beene already
said, but referre you thereunto for the sowing, planting, &c. onely I
will here shew you the manner of ordering them for Sallets. There are
some sorts of Lettice that growe very great, and close their heads,
which are called Cabbage Lettice, both ordinary and extraordinary, and
there are other sorts of great Lettice that are open, and close not,
or cabbage not at all, which yet are of an excellent kinde, if they be
vsed after that especiall manner is fit for them, which is, That when
they are planted (for after they are sowne, they must be transplanted)
of a reasonable distance in sunder, and growne to be of some bignesse,
euery one of them must bee tyed together with bast or thread toward
the toppes of the leaues, that by this meanes all the inner leaues may
growe whitish, which then are to be cut vp and vsed: for the keeping
of the leaues close doth make them taste delicately, and to bee very
tender. And these sorts of Lettice for the most part are spent after
Summer is past, when other Lettice are not to be had. Lambes Lettice
or Corne Sallet is an herbe, which abiding all Winter, is the first
Sallet herbe of the yeare that is vsed before any ordinarie Lettice is
ready; it is therefore vsually sowne in August, when the seede thereof
is ripe. Purslane is a Summer Sallet herbe, and is to be sowne in the
Spring, yet somewhat late, because it is tender, and ioyeth in warmth;
and therefore diuers haue sowne it vpon those beddes of dung, whereon
they noursed vp their Cowcumbers, &c. after they are taken away, which
being well and often watered, hath yeelded Sallet vntill the end of the
yeare. Spinach is sowne in the Spring, of all for the most part that
vse it, but yet if it be sowne in Summer it will abide greene all the
Winter, and then seedeth quickly: it is a Sallet that hath little or
no taste at all therein, like as Lettice and Purslane, and therefore
Cookes know how to make many a good dish of meate with it, by putting
Sugar and Spice thereto. Coleworts are of diuers kinds, and although
some of them are wholly spent among the poorer sort of people, yet some
kindes of them may be dressed and ordered as may delight a curious
palate, which is, that being boyled tender, the middle ribs are taken
cold, and laid in dishes, and vinegar and oyle poured thereon, and so
eaten. Coleflowers are to be had in this Countrey but very seldome,
for that it is harde to meete with good seede: it must bee sowne on
beds of dung to force it forward, or else it would perish with the
frost before it had giuen his head of flowers, and transplanted into
verie good and rich ground, lest you lose the benefit of your labours.
Endiue is of two sorts, the ordinary, and another that hath the edges
of the leaues curld or crumpled; it is to be whited, to make it the
more dainty Sallet, which is vsually done in this manner: After they
are grown to some reasonable greatnesse (but in any case before they
shoote forth a stalke in the midst for seede) they are to be taken vp,
and the rootes being cut away, lay them to dry or wither for three
or foure houres, and then bury them in sand, so as none of them lye
one vpon another, or if you can, one to touch another, which by this
meanes will change whitish, and thereby become verie tender, and is a
Sallet both for Autumne and Winter. Succorie is vsed by some in the
same manner, but because it is more bitter then Endiue, it is not so
generally vsed, or rather vsed but of a verie few: and whereas Endiue
will seede the same yeare it is sowne, and then dye, Succorie abideth
manie yeares, the bitternesse thereof causing it to be more Physicall
to open obstructions; and therefore the flowers pickled vp, as diuers
other flowers are vsed to be now adaies, make a delicate Sallet at all
times when there is occasion to vse them. Of red Beetes, the rootes are
onely vsed both boyled and eaten cold with vinegar and oyle, and is
also vsed to trimme vp or garnish forth manie sorts of dishes of meate:
the seede of the best kinde will not abide good with vs aboue three
yeares, but will degenerate and growe worse; and therefore those that
delight therein must be curious, to be prouided from beyond Sea, that
they may haue such as will giue delight. Sorrell is an herbe so common,
and the vse so well knowne, both for sawce, and to season broths and
meates for the sound as well as sicke persons, that I shall not neede
to say anie more thereof. Cheruill is a Sallet herbe of much vse, both
with French and Dutch, who doe much more delight in herbes of stronger
taste then the English doe: it is sowne early, and vsed but a while,
because it quickly runneth vp to seede. Sweete Cheruill,or as some call
it, Sweete Cis, is so like in taste vnto Anise seede, that it much
delighteth the taste among other herbes in a Sallet: the seede is long,
thicke, blacke, and cornered, and must be sowne in the end of Autumne,
that it may lye in the ground all the Winter, and then it will shoote
out in the Spring, or else if it be sowne in the Spring, it will not
spring vp that yeare vntill the next: the leaues (as I said before) are
vsed among other herbes: the rootes likewise are not onely cordiall,
but also held to be preseruatiue against the Plague, either greene,
dryed, or preserued with sugar. Rampion rootes are a kinde of Sallet
with a great many, being boyled tender, and eaten cold with vinegar
and pepper. Cresses is an herbe of easie and quick growth, and while
it is young eaten eyther alone, or with parsley and other herbes: it
is of a strong taste to them that are not accustomed thereunto, but it
is much vsed of strangers. Rocket is of the same nature and qualitie,
but somewhat stronger in taste: they are both sowen in the Spring,
and rise, seede and dye the same yeare. Tarragon is an herbe of as
strong a taste as eyther Rocket or Cresses, it abideth and dyeth not
euery yeare, nor yet giueth ripe seede (as far as euer could bee found
with vs) any yeare, but maketh sufficient increase within the ground,
spreading his roots all abroad a great way off. Mustard is a common
sawce both with fish and flesh, and the seede thereof (and no part of
the plant besides) is well knowne how to be vsed being grownded, as
euery one I thinke knoweth. The rootes of horse Radish likewise beeing
grownd like Mustard, is vsed both of strangers and our owne nation,
as sawce for fish. Tansie is of great vse, almost with all manner of
persons in the Spring of the yeare: it is more vsually planted of the
rootes then otherwise; for in that the rootes spread far and neere they
may be easily taken away, without any hurt to the rest of the rootes.
Burnet, although it be more vsed in wine in the Summer time then any
way else, yet it is likewise made a sallet herbe with many, to amend
the harm or weak rellish of some other herbs. Skirrets are better to
be sowen of the seed then planted from the roots, and will come on
more speedily, and be fairer rootes: they are as often eaten cold as a
Sallet, being boyled and the pith taken out, as stewed with butter and
eaten warme. Let not Parsley and Fenell be forgotten among your other
Sallet herbes, whereof I haue spoken before, and therefore need say no
more of them. The flowers of Marigolds pickt cleane from the heads, and
pickled vp against winter, make an excellent Sallet when no flowers
are to be had in a garden. Cloue Gilloflowers likewise preserued or
pickled vp in the same manner (which is _stratum super stratum_, a lay
of flowers, and then strawed ouer with fine dry and poudered Sugar, and
so lay after lay strawed ouer, vntill the pot bee full you meane to
keepe them in, and after filled vp or couered ouer with vinegar) make
a Sallet now adayes in the highest esteeme with Gentles and Ladies of
the greatest note: the planting and ordering of them both is spoken of
seuerally in their proper places. Goates bearde that groweth in Gardens
only, as well as that which groweth wilde in Medowes, &c. bearing a
yellow flower, are vsed as a Sallet, the rootes beeing boyled and pared
are eaten cold with vinegar, oyle and pepper; or else stewed with
butter and eaten warme as Skirrets, Parsneps &c. And thus haue you here
set downe all those most vsuall Sallets are vsed in this Kingdome: I
say the most vsuall, or that are noursed vp in Gardens; for I know
there are some other wilde herbes and rootes, as Dandelion &c. but they
are vsed onely of strangers, and of those whose curiositie searcheth
out the whole worke of nature to satisfie their desires.




CHAP. VII.

_Of diuers Physicall herbes fit to be planted in Gardens, to serue for
the especiall vses of a familie._


Hauing thus shewed you all the herbes that are most vsually planted in
Kitchen Gardens for ordinary vses, let mee also adde a few other that
are also noursed vp by many in their Gardens, to preserue health, and
helpe to cure such small diseases as are often within the compasse of
the Gentlewomens skils, who, to helpe their owne family, and their
poore neighbours that are farre remote from Physitians and Chirurgions,
take much paines both to doe good vnto them, and to plant those herbes
that are conducing to their desires. And although I doe recite some
that are mentioned in other places, yet I thought it meete to remember
them altogether in one place. Angelica, the garden kinde, is so good
an herbe, that there is no part thereof but is of much vse, and all
cordiall and preseruatiue from infectious or contagious diseases,
whether you will distill the water of the herbe, or preserue or candie
the rootes or the greene stalkes, or vse the seede in pouder or in
distillations, or decoctions with other things: it is sowen of seede,
and will abide vntill it giue seede, and then dyeth. Rue or Herbe
grace is a strong herbe, yet vsed inwardly against the plague as an
Antidote with Figs and Wall-nuts, and helpeth much against windy
bodies: outwardly it is vsed to bee layde to the wrestes of the hands,
to driue away agues: it is more vsually planted of slips then raised
from seede, and abideth long if sharpe frostes kill it not. Dragons
being distilled are held to be good to expell any euill thing from the
heart: they are altogether planted of the rootes. Setwall, Valerian,
or Capons tayle, the herbe often, but the roote much better, is vsed
to prouoke sweating, thereby to expell euill vapours that might annoy
the heart: it is only planted of the rootes when they are taken vp, and
the young replanted. Asarabacca, the leaues are often vsed to procure
vomiting being stamped, and the strained iuice to a little quantitie,
put into a draught of ale and drunke, thereby to ease the stomacke of
many euill and grosse humours that there lye and offend it; diuers
also take the leaues and rootes a little boyled in wine, with a little
spice added thereunto, to expell both tertian and quartan agues: the
rootes of our English growing is more auaileable for these purposes
then any outlandish: it is planted by the roote; for I could neuer see
it spring of seede. Masterwort commeth somewhat neere in propertie vnto
Angelica, and besides very effectuall to disperse winde in the bodie,
whether of the colicke or otherwise; as also very profitable to comfort
in all cold causes: it yeeldeth seede, but yet is more vsually planted
from the rootes being parted. Balme is a cordiall herbe both in smell
and taste, and is wholly vsed for those purposes, that is, to comfort
the heart being distilled into water either simple or compound, or the
herbe dryed and vsed: it is set of the rootes being parted, because it
giueth no seede that euer I could obserue. Camomill is a common herbe
well knowne, and is planted of the rootes in alleyes, in walkes, and
on bankes to sit on, for that the more it is troden on, and pressed
downe in dry weather, the closer it groweth, and the better it will
thriue: the vse thereof is very much, both to warme and comfort, and to
ease paines being applyed outwardly after many fashions: the decoction
also of the flowers prouoketh sweat, and they are much vsed against
agues. Featherfew is an herbe of greater vse for women then for men,
to dissolue flatulent or windy humours, which causeth the paines of
the mother: some vse to take the iuice thereof in drinke for agues:
it is as well sowen of the seede as planted of the rootes. Costmary
is vsed among those herbes that are put into ale to cause it haue a
good rellish, and to be somewhat physicall in the moneth of May, and
doth helpe to prouoke vrine: it is set of the rootes being parted.
Maudlin is held to be a principall good herbe to open and cleanse the
liuer, and for that purpose is vsed many wayes, as in ale, in tansies,
and in broths &c. the seed also is vsed, and so is the herbe also
sometimes, to kill the wormes in children: it is sowen of the seede,
and planted also of the separated rootes. Cassidonie is a small kinde
of Lauender, but differing both in forme and qualitie: it is much vsed
for the head to ease paines thereof, as also put among other things to
purge melancholicke diseases: it is sowen of seede, and abideth not a
winter vnlesse it bee well defended, and yet hardly giueth ripe seede
againe with vs. Smallage is a great opening herbe, and much more then
eyther Parsley or Fenell, and the rootes of them all are often vsed
together in medicines: it is sowen of seede, and will not bee wanting
in a Garden if once you suffer it to sow it selfe. Cardus Benedictus,
or the Blessed Thistle, is much vsed in the time of any infection or
plague, as also to expell any euill symptome from the heart at all
other times. It is vsed likewise to be boyled in posset drink, & giuen
to them that haue an ague, to help to cure it by sweating or otherwise.
It is vsually sowen of seed, and dyeth when it hath giuen seed. Winter
Cherries are likewise nursed vp in diuers gardens, for that their
propertie is to giue helpe to them that are troubled eyther with the
stopping or heate or their vrine: the herbe and berries are often
distilled, but the berries alone are more often vsed: after it is once
planted in a garden it will runne vnder ground, & abide well enough.
Celondine is held to bee good for the iaundise, it is much vsed for to
cleere dim eyes, eyther the iuice or the water dropped into them: it is
sowen of seede, and being once brought into a garden, will hardly be
weeded out; the seede that sheddeth will so sow it selfe, and therefore
some corner in a garden is the fittest place for it. Tabacco is of two
sorts, and both vsed to be planted in Gardens, yet the English kinde
(as it is called) is more to be found in our Countrey Gardens then the
Indian sort: the leaues of both sorts indifferently, that is, of eyther
of which is next at hand, being stamped and boyled eyther by it selfe,
or with other herbes in oyle or hogs suet, doe make an excellent salue
for greene wounds, and also to clense old vlcers or sores; the iuice of
the greene leaues drunke in ale, or a dryed leafe steeped in wine or
ale for a night, and the wine or ale drunke in the morning, prouoketh
to cast, but the dryed leafe much stronger then the greene: they are
sowen of seede, but the Indian kinde is more tender, and will not abide
a winter with vs abroade. Spurge that vsually groweth in Gardens, is
a violent purger, and therefore it is needfull to be very carefull
how it is vsed: the seede is more ordinarily vsed then any other part
of the plant, which purgeth by vomiting in some, and both vpwards and
downwards in many; the iuice of the herbe, but especially the milke
thereof, is vsed to kill wartes: it is sowen of seede, and when it doth
once shed it selfe, it will still continue springing of the fallen
seede. Bearefoote is sowen of seed, and will hardly abide transplanting
vnlesse it bee while it is young; yet abideth diuers yeares, if it
stand not in too cold a place. This I speake of the greater kinde;
for the lower small wilde kinde (which is the most ordinary in this
land) will neuer decay: the leaues are sometimes vsed greene, but most
vsually dryed and poudered, and giuen in drinke to them that haue
the wormes: it purgeth melancholy, but especially the roots. In many
Countries of this Land, and elsewhere, they vse to thrust the stalk
of the great kinde through the eare or dewlap of Kine and Cattell,
to cure them of many diseases. Salomons Seale, or (as some call it)
Ladder to heauen, although it doth grow wilde in many places of this
Land, yet is planted in Gardens: it is accounted an excellent wound
herbe to consolidate, and binde, insomuch that many vse it with good
successe to cure ruptures, and to slay both the white and the red fluxe
in women: it is planted altogether of the rootes, for I could neuer
finde it spring from the seede, it is so strong. Comfry likewise is
found growing wilde in many places by ditch sides, and in moist places,
and therefore requireth some moist places of the garden: it is wholly
vsed for knitting, binding, and consolidating fluxes and wounds, to be
applyed either inwardly or outwardly: The rootes are stronger for those
purposes then any other parts of the plant. Licoris is much vsed now
adaies to bee planted in great quantitie, euen to fill many acres of
ground, whereof riseth a great deale of profit to those that know how
to order it, and haue fit grounds for it to thriue in; for euery ground
will not be aduantagious: It will require a very rich, deepe and mellow
ground, eyther naturall or artificiall; but for a priuate house where
a small quantitie will serue, there needeth not so much curiositie: it
is vsually planted of the top heads, when the lower rootes (which are
the Licoris that is vsed) and the runners are cut from them. Some vse
to make an ordinary drinke or beuerage of Licoris, boyled in water as
our vsuall ale or beere is with malt, which fermented with barme in the
same manner, and tunned vp, serueth in stead thereof, as I am credibly
informed: It is otherwise in a manner wholly spent for colds, coughes
and rheumes, to expectorate flegme, but vsed in diuers formes, as in
iuice, in decoctions, syrrups, roules, trochisces, and the greene or
dryed roote of it selfe.

And these are the most ordinary Physicall herbes that are vsed to be
planted in gardens for the vse of any Country familie, that is (as I
said before) farre remote from Physitians or Chirurgions abidings, that
they may vse as occasion serueth for themselues or their neighbours,
and by a little care and paines in the applying may doe a great deale
of good, and sometimes to them that haue not wherewith to spend on
themselues, much lesse on Physitians or Chirurgions, or if they haue,
may oftentimes receiue lesse good at their hands then at others that
are taught by experience in their owne families, to be the more able to
giue helpe to others.




THE KITCHEN GARDEN.

THE SECOND PART,


Containing as well all sorts of herbes, as rootes and fruits, that
are vsually planted in Gardens, to serue for the vse of the Table
whether of the poore or rich of our Countrey: but herein I intend not
to bring any fruite bearing trees, shrubbes, or bushes; for I reserue
them for my Orchard, wherin they shal be set forth. So that in these
three parts, I suppose the exquisite ornament of any worthy house
is consummate for the exteriour bounds, the benefit of their riches
extending also to the furnishing of the most worthy inward parts
thereof: but because many take pleasure in the sight and knowledge of
other herbes that are Physicall, and much more in their properties and
vertues, if vnto these three I should adde a Physicke Garden, or Garden
of Simples, there would be a quadripartite complement, of whatsoeuer
arte or nature, necessitie or delight could affect: which to effect
(as many my friends haue, intreated it at my hands) will require more
paines and time then all this worke together: yet to satisfie their
desires and all others herein, that would bee enformed in the truth,
and reformed of the many errours and slips set forth and published
heretofore of plants by diuers, I shall (God assisting and granting
life) labour to performe, that it may shew it selfe to the light in due
conueniencie, if these bee well and gratefully accepted. And because
I ended with some sweete herbes in the former part, I will in this
part beginne with the rest, which I reserued for this place, as fitter
for the pot and kitchen then for the hand or bosome, and so descend
to other herbes that are for meat or sallets: and after them to those
rootes that are to be eaten, as meate or as sallets: and lastly the
fruits that grow neere, or vpon the ground, or not much aboue it; as
the Artichoke, &c. in which I make a shorter description then I did in
the former, rather endeauouring to shew what they are, and whereunto
they are vsed, then the whole varietie or any exact declaration: which
methode, although in some sort it may bee fitting for this purpose,
yet it is not for an history or herball: I shall therefore require
their good acceptance for whose sake I doe it, not doubting, but that
I, or others, if they write againe of this subiect, may polish and
amende what formerly hath beene eyther mis set, or not so thoroughly
expressed, besides some additions of new conceits; seeing I treade out
a new path, and therefore those that follow may the easilier see the
Meanders, and so goe on in a direct line.




CHAP. I.

_Maiorana latifolia, siue maior Anglica._   Winter, or pot Marierome.


Winter Marierome is a small bushie herbe like vnto sweete Marierome,
being parted or diuided into many branches, whereon doe grow broader
and greener leaues, set by couples, with some small leaues likewise at
the seuerall ioynts all along the branches: at the tops whereof grow a
number of small purplish white flowers set together in a tuft, which
turne into small and round seed, bigger then sweet Marierome seede:
the whole plant is of a small and fine sent, but much inferiour to the
other, and is nothing so bitter as the sweete Marierome, and thereby
both the fitter and more willingly vsed for meates: the roote is white
and threddy, and perisheth not as the former, but abideth many yeares.


        The Vse of winter Marierome.

        The vse of this Marierome is more frequent in our Land then
        in others, being put among other pot-herbes and farsing (or
        faseting herbes as they are called) and may to good profit bee
        applyed in inward as well as outward griefes for to comfort the
        parts, although weaker in effect then sweete Marieromes.




CHAP. II.

_Thymum vulgatius siue durius._   Ordinary Garden Tyme.


The ordinary Garden Tyme is a small low wooddy plant with brittle
branches, and small hard greene leaues, as euery one knoweth, hauing
small white purplish flowers, standing round about the tops of the
stalkes: the seed is small and browne, darker then Marierome seed: the
root is woody, and abideth well diuers Winters.


_Thymum latifolium._   Masticke Tyme.

This Tyme hath neyther so wooddy branches, nor so hard leaues, but
groweth lower, more spreading, and with somewhat broader leaues; the
flowers are of a purplish white colour, standing in roundles round
about the stalkes, at the ioynts with leaues at them likewise. This
Tyme endureth better and longer then the former, and by spreading
it selfe more then the former, is the more apt to bee propagated by
slipping, because it hath beene seldome seene to giue seede: It is not
so quicke in sent or taste as the former, but is fitter to set any
border or knot in a garden, and is for the most part wholly employed to
such vses.


        The Vse of Tyme.

        To set downe all the particular vses whereunto Tyme is applyed,
        were to weary both the Writer and Reader; I will but only note
        out a few: for besides the physicall vses to many purposes,
        for the head, stomacke, splene, &c. there is no herbe almost
        of more vse, in the houses both of high and low, rich and
        poore, both, for inward and outward occasions; outwardly for
        bathings among other hot herbes, and among other sweete herbes
        for strewings: inwardly in most sorts of broths, with Rosmary,
        as also with other faseting (or rather farsing) herbes, and to
        make sawce for diuers sorts both fish and flesh, as to stuffe
        the belly of a Goose to bee rosted, and after put into the
        sawce, and the pouder with breade to strew on meate when it is
        rosted, and so likewise on rosted or fryed fish. It is held by
        diuers to bee a speedy remedy against the sting of a Bee, being
        bruised and layd thereon.

CHAP. III.

_Satureia siue Thymbra._   Sauorie.


There are two sorts of Sauory, the one called Summer, and the other
Winter Sauorie: The Summer Sauory is a small tender herbe, growing not
aboue a foote and a halfe high, or thereabouts, rising vp with diuers
brittle branches, slenderly or sparsedly set with small long leaues,
soft in handling, at euery ioynt a couple, one against another, of a
pleasant strong and quicke sent and taste: the flowers are small and
purplish, growing at the toppes of the stalkes, with two small long
leaues at the ioynts vnder them: the seede is small, and of a darke
colour, bigger then Tyme seede by the halfe: the roote is wooddy, and
hath many strings, perishing euery yeare wholly, and must bee new sowen
againe, if any will haue it.

The Winter Sauorie is a small low bushie herbe, very like vnto Hyssope,
but not aboue a foote high, with diuers small hard branches, and hard
darke green leaues thereon, thicker set together then the former by
much, and as thicke as common Hyssope, sometimes with foure leaues or
more at a ioynt, of a reasonable strong sent, yet not so strong or
quicke as the former: the flowers are of a pale purplish colour, set
at seuerall distances at the toppes of the stalkes, with leaues at the
ioynts also with them, like the former: the roote is woody, with diuers
small strings thereat, and abideth all the winter with his greene
leaues: it is more vsually encreased by slipping or diuiding the roote,
and new setting it seuerally againe in the Spring, then by sowing the
seed.


        The Vse of Sauorie.

        The Summer Sauorie is vsed in other Countryes much more then
        with vs in their ordinary diets, as condiment or sawce to their
        meates, sometimes of it selfe, and sometimes with other herbes,
        and sometimes strewed or layde vpon the dishes as we doe
        Parsley, as also with beanes and pease, rise and wheate; and
        sometimes the dryed herbe boyled among pease to make pottage.

        The Winter Sauorie is one of the (farsing) faseting herbes as
        they call them, and so is the Summer Sauorie also sometimes.
        This is vsed also in the same manner that the Summer Sauorie
        is, set downe before, and to the same purposes: as also to put
        into puddings, sawsages, and such like kindes of meates. Some
        doe vse the pouder of the herbe dryed (as I sayd before of
        Tyme) to mixe with grated bread, to breade their meate, be it
        fish or flesh, to giue it the quicker rellish. They are both
        effectuall to expell winde.




CHAP. IIII.

_Hyssopus._   Hyssope.


Garden Hyssope is so well knowne to all that haue beene in a Garden,
that I shall but _actum agere_, to bestow any time thereon, being
a small bushie plant, not rising aboue two foote high, with many
branches, woody below, and tender aboue, whereon are set at certaine
distances, sundry small, long and narrow greene leaues: at the toppe of
euery stalke stand blewish purple gaping flowers, one aboue another in
a long spike or eare: after which followeth the seede, which is small
and blackish: the rootes are composed of many threddy strings; the
whole plant is of a strong sweet sent.


        The Vse of Hyssope.

        Hyssope is much vsed in Ptisans and other drinkes, to help
        to expectorate flegme. It is many Countrey peoples medicine
        for a cut or greene wound, being bruised with sugar and
        applyed. I finde it is also much commended against the falling
        sickenesse, especially being made into pils after the manner
        before rehearsed. It is accounted a speciall remedy against
        the sting or biting of an Adder, if the place be rubbed
        with Hyssope, bruised and mixed with honey, salt and cummin
        seede. A decoction thereof with oyle, and annointed, taketh
        away the itching and tingling of the head, and vermine also
        breeding therein. An oyle made of the herbe and flowers, being
        annointed, doth comfort benummed sinewes and ioynts.




CHAP. V.

_Pulegium._   Pennyroyall.


Pennyroyall also is an herbe so well knowne, that I shall not neede
to spend much time in the description of it: hauing many weake round
stalkes, diuided into sundry branches, rather leaning or lying vpon
the ground then standing vpright, whereon are set at seuerall ioynts,
small roundish darke greene leaues: the flowers are purplish that grow
in gardens, yet some that grow wilde are white, or more white then
purple, set in roundles about the tops of the branches; the stalkes
shoote forth small fibres or rootes at the ioynts, as it lyeth vpon the
ground, thereby fastening it selfe therein, and quickly increaseth, and
ouer-runneth any ground, especially in the shade or any moist place,
and is replanted by breaking the sprouted stalkes, and so quickely
groweth.

Other sorts of Pennyroyall are fit for the Physicke Garden, or Garden
of Simples.


        The Vse of Pennyroyall.

        It is very good and wholesome for the lunges, to expell cold
        thin flegme, and afterwards to warme and dry it vp: and is also
        of the like propertie as Mintes, to comfort the stomacke, and
        stay vomiting. It is also vsed in womens baths and washings:
        and in mens also to comfort the sinewes. It is yet to this
        day, as it hath beene in former times, vsed to bee put into
        puddings, and such like meates of all sorts, and therefore in
        diuers places they know it by no other name then
        Pudding-grasse.

        The former age of our great Grandfathers, had all these hot
        herbes in much and familiar vse, both for their meates and
        medicines, and therewith preserued themselues in long life
        and much health: but this delicate age of ours, which is not
        pleased with any thing almost, be it meat or medicine, that is
        not pleasant to the palate, doth wholly refuse these almost,
        and therefore cannot be partaker of the benefit or them.




CHAP. VI.

_Salvia._ Sage.


There are two especiall kindes of Sage noursed vp in our Gardens, for
our ordinary vse, whereof I intend to write in this place, leauing the
rest to his fitter place. Our ordinary Sage is reckoned to bee of two
sorts, white and red, both of them bearing many foure square wooddy
stalkes, in some whiter, in others redder, as the leaues are also,
standing by couples at the ioynts, being long, rough, and wrinkled,
of a strong sweete sent: at the tops of the stalkes come forth the
flowers, set at certaine spaces one aboue another, which are long and
gaping, like vnto the flowers of Clary, or dead Nettles, but of a
blewish purple colour; after which come small round seede in the huske
that bore the flower: the roote is wooddy, with diuers strings at it:
It is more vsually planted of the slips, pricked in the Spring time
into the ground, then of the seed.


_Saluia minor siue pinnata._   Small Sage or Sage of vertue.

The lesser Sage is in all things like vnto the former white Sage, but
that his branches are long and slender, and the leaues much smaller,
hauing for the most part at the bottome of each side of the leafe a
peece of a leafe, which maketh it shew like finns or eares: the flowers
also are of a blewish purple colour, but lesser. Of this kinde there is
one that beareth white flowers.


        The Vse of Sage.

        Sage is much vsed of many in the moneth of May fasting, with
        butter and Parsley, and is held of most much to conduce to the
        health of mans body.

        It is also much vsed among other good herbes to bee tund vp
        with Ale, which thereupon is termed Sage Ale, whereof many
        barrels full are made, and drunke in the said moneth chiefly
        for the purpose afore recited: and also for teeming women, to
        helpe them the better forward in their childebearing, if there
        be feare of abortion or miscarrying.

        It is also vsed to be boyled among other herbes, to make
        Gargles or waters to wash sore mouths and throates: As also
        among other herbes, that serue as bathings, to wash mens legs
        or bodies in the Summer time, to comfort nature, and warme and
        strengthen aged cold sinewes, and lengthen the strength of the
        younger.

        The Kitchen vse is either to boyle it with a Calues head, and
        being minced, to be put with the braines, vinegar and pepper,
        to serue as an ordinary sawce thereunto: Or being beaten and
        iuyced (rather then minced as mannie doe) is put to a rosted
        Pigges braines, with Currans for sawce thereunto. It is in
        small quantity (in regard of the strong taste thereof) put
        among other fasting herbes, to serue as sawce for peeces of
        Veale, when they are farsed or stuffed therewith, and rosted,
        which they call Olliues.

        For all the purposes aforesaid, the small Sage is accounted to
        be of the more force and vertue.




CHAP. VII.

_Horminum sativum._   Garden Clary.


There is but one sort of Garden Clary, though many wilde, which hath
foure square stalks, with broad rough wrinkled whitish leaues, somewhat
vneuenly cut in on the edges, and of a strong sweete sent, growing
some next the ground, & some by couples vpon the stalkes: the flowers
growe at certaine distances, with two small leaues at the ioynts vnder
them, somewhat like vnto the flowers of Sage, but lesser, and of a
very whitish or bleake blew colour: the seede is of a blackish browne
colour, somewhat flat, and not so round as the wilde: the rootes spread
not farre, and perish euery yeare that they beare flowers and seede. It
is altogether to bee sowne of seed in the Spring time, yet sometimes it
will rise of it owne sowing.


        The Vse of Clary.

        The most frequent and common vse of Clary, is for men or women
        that haue weake backes, to helpe to comfort and strengthen the
        raines, being made into Tansies and eaten, or otherwise. The
        seede is vsed of some to be put into the corner of the eye, if
        any mote or other thing haue happened into it: but assuredly
        although this may peraduenture doe some good, yet the seede of
        the wilde will doe much more. The leaues taken dry, and dipped
        into a batter made of the yolkes of egges, flower, and a little
        milke, and then fryed with butter vntill they be crispe, serue
        for a dish of meate accepted with manie, vnpleasant to none.




CHAP. VIII.

_Nepeta._   Nep.


Although those that are Herbarists do know three sorts of Nep, a
greater & two lesser, yet because the lesser are not vsuall, but in
the Gardens of those that delight in natures varieties, I do not here
shew you them. That which is vsuall (and called of manie Cat Mint)
beareth square stalkes, but not so great as Clarie, hauing two leaues
at euery ioynt, somewhat like vnto Balme or Speare Mintes, but whiter,
softer, and longer, and nicked about the edges, of a strong sent, but
nothing so strong as Clary: the flowers growe at the toppes of the
stalkes, as it were in long spikes or heads, somewhat close together,
yet compassing the stalkes at certaine ioynts, of a whitish colour,
for forme and bignesse like vnto Balme, or somewhat bigger: the rootes
are composed of a number of strings, which dye not, but keepe greene
leaues vpon them all the Winter, and shoote anew in the Spring. It is
propagated both by the seede, and by slipping the rootes.


        The Vse of Nep.

        Nep is much vsed of women either in baths or drinkes to procure
        their feminine courses: as also with Clarie, being fryed into
        Tansies, to strengthen their backes. It is much commended of
        some, if the iuyce thereof be drunke with wine, to helpe those
        that are bruised by some fall, or other accident. A decoction
        of Nep is auaileable to cure the scabbe in the head, or other
        places of the body.




CHAP. IX.

_Melissa._   Baulme.


The Garden Baulme which is of common knowne vse, hath diuers square
blackish greene stalkes, and round, hard, darke, greene pointed leaues,
growing thereon by couples, a little notched about the edges, of a
pleasant sweete sent, drawing nearest to the sent of a Lemon or Citron;
and therefore of some called _Citrago_: the flowers growe about the
toppes of the stalkes at certaine distances, being small and gaping,
of a pale carnation colour, almost white: the rootes fasten themselues
strongly in the ground, and endure many yeares, and is encreased by
diuiding the rootes; for the leaues dye downe to the ground euery
yeare, leauing no shew of leafe or stalke in the Winter.


        The Vse of Baulme.

        Baulme is often vsed among other hot and sweete herbes, to make
        baths and washings for mens bodies or legges, in the Summer
        time, to warme and comfort the veines and sinewes, to very good
        purpose and effect, and hath in former ages beene of much more
        vse then now adaies. It is also vsed by diuers to be stilled,
        being steeped in Ale, to make a Baulme water, after the manner
        they haue beene taught, which they keepe by them, to vse in
        the stead of _Aqua vitæ_, when they haue any occasion for
        their owne or their neighbours Families, in suddaine qualmes
        or passions of the heart: but if they had a little better
        direction (for this is somewhat too rude) it would doe them
        more good that take it: For the herbe without all question is
        an excellent helpe to comfort the heart, as the very smell
        may induce any so to beleeue. It is also good to heale greene
        wounds, being made into salues: and I verily thinke, that our
        forefathers hearing of the healing and comfortable properties
        of the true naturall Baulme, and finding this herbe to be so
        effectuall, gaue it the name of Baulme, in imitation of his
        properties and vertues. It is also an herbe wherein Bees doe
        much delight, as hath beene found by experience of those that
        haue kept great store; if the Hiues bee rubbed on the inside
        with some thereof, and as they thinke it draweth others by the
        smell thereof to resort thither. Plinie saith, it is a present
        remedy against the stinging of Bees.




CHAP. X.

_Mentha._   Mintes.


There are diuers sorts of Mints, both of the garden, and wilde, of the
woods, mountaines, and standing pooles or waters: but I will onely in
this place bring to your remembrance two or three sorts of the most
vsuall that are kept in gardens, for the vses whereunto they are proper.

Red Mint or browne Mint hath square brownish stalkes, with somewhat
long and round pointed leaues, nicked about the edges, of a darke
greene colour, set by couples at euery ioynt, and of a reasonable good
sent: the flowers of this kinde are reddish, standing about the toppes
of the stalkes at distances: the rootes runne creeping in the ground,
and as the rest, will hardly be cleared out of a garden, being once
therein, in that the smallest peece thereof will growe and encrease
apace.

Speare Mint hath a square greene stalke, with longer and greener leaues
then the former, set by couples, of a better and more comfortable sent,
and therefore of much more vse then any other: the flowers hereof growe
in long eares or spikes, of a pale red or blush colour: the roots
creepe in the ground like the other.

Party coloured or white Mint hath square greene stalkes and leaues,
somewhat larger then Speare Mint, and more nicked in the edges, whereof
many are parted, halfe white and halfe greene, and some more white then
greene, or more green then white, as nature listeth: the flowers stand
in long heads close set together, of a blush colour: the rootes creepe
as the rest doe.

   5 _Balsamita mas, seu Costus hortorum._ Costmary.
   6 _Ageratum._ Maudeline.
]


        The Vse of Mintes.

        Mintes are oftentimes vsed in baths, with Baulme and other
        herbes, as a helpe to comfort and strengthen the nerues and
        sinewes.

        It is much vsed either outwardly applyed, or inwardly drunke,
        to strengthen and comfort weake stomackes, that are much giuen
        to casting: as also for feminine fluxes. It is boyled in milke
        for those whose stomackes are apt to cause it to curdle. And
        applyed with salt, is a good helpe for the biting of a mad
        dogge.

        It is vsed to be boyled with Mackarell, and other fish.

        Being dryed, is often and much vsed with Penniroyall, to bee
        put into puddings: as also among pease that are boyled for
        pottage.

        Where Dockes are not ready at hand, they vse to bruise Mintes,
        and lay them vpon any place that is stung with Bees, Waspes, or
        such like, and that to good purpose.




CHAP. XI.

_Balsamita mas & fæmina, seu Costus hortorum maior & minor._
Costmary and Maudeline.


Costmary or Alecoast is a sweet herbe, bearing many broad and long
pale green leaues, snipped about the edges, euery one vpon a long
foote-stalke; among which rise vp many round greene stalkes, with such
like leaues on them, but lesser vp to the toppe, where it spreadeth it
selfe into three or foure branches, euery one bearing an vmbell or tuft
of gold yellow flowers, somewhat like vnto Tansie flowers, but lesser,
which turne into small heads, containing small flat long seede: the
roote is somewhat hard and stringy, and being diuided, is replanted in
the Spring of the yeare for increase.

Maudeline hath somewhat long and narrow leaues, snipt about the edges:
the stalks are two foot high, bearing many yellow flowers on the tops
of the branches, in an vmbell or tuft like vnto Tansie: the whole herbe
is sweete, and somewhat bitter, and is replanted by slipping.


        The Vse of Costmary and Maudeline.

        Costmary is of especiall vse in the Spring of the yeare, among
        other such like herbes, to make Sage Ale, and thereupon I
        thinke it tooke the name of Alecoast.

        It is also vsed to be put among other sweete herbes, to make
        sweete washing water, whereof there is great store spent.

        The leaues haue an especiall vertue to comfort both the
        stomack and heart, and to warme and dry a moist braine. The
        seede is much vsed in the Country, to be giuen to children for
        the wormes, in the stead of wormseed, and so is the seede of
        Maudeline also.

        Maudeline is much vsed with Costmary and other sweet herbes, to
        make sweete washing water: the flowers also are tyed vp with
        small bundels of Lauender toppes, these being put in the middle
        of them, to lye, vpon the toppes of beds, presses, &c. for the
        sweete sent and sauour it casteth. It is generally accounted
        of our Apothecaries to be the true _Eupatorium_ of Auicen, and
        the true _Ageratum_ of Dioscorides; but Dodonæus seemeth to
        contradict both.




CHAP. XII.

_Tanacetum vulgare & crispum._   Tansie.


Ovr Garden Tansie hath many hard greene leaues, or rather wings of
leaues; for they are many small ones, set one against another all along
a middle ribbe or stalke, and snipt about the edges: in some the leaues
stand closer and thicker, and somewhat crumpled, which hath caused
it to be called double or curld Tansie, in others thinner and more
sparsedly: It riseth vp with many hard stalks, whereon growe at the
tops vpon the seuerall small branches gold yellow flowers like buttons,
which being gathered in their prime, will hold the colour fresh a long
time: the seede is small, and as it were chaffie: the roote creepeth
vnder ground, and shooteth vp againe in diuers places: the whole herbe,
both leaues and flowers, are of a sharpe, strong, bitter smell and
taste, but yet pleasant, and well to be endured.


        The Vse of Tansie.

        The leaues of Tansie are vsed while they are young, either
        shred small with other herbes, or else the iuyce of it and
        other herbes fit for the purpose, beaten with egges, and fryed
        into cakes (in Lent and the Spring of the yeare) which are
        vsually called Tansies, and are often eaten, being taken to
        be very good for the stomack, to helpe to digest from thence
        bad humours that cleaue thereunto: As also for weak raines and
        kidneyes, when the vrine passeth away by drops: This is thought
        to be of more vse for men then for women. The seed is much
        commended against all sorts of wormes in children.




CHAP. XIII.

_Pimpinella siue Sanguisorba._   Burnet.


Burnet hath many winged leaues lying vpon, the ground, made of many
small, round, yet pointed greene leaues, finely nicked on the edges,
one set against another all along a middle ribbe, and one at the end
thereof; from among which rise vp diuers round, and sometimes crested
browne stalkes, with some few such like leaues on them as growe belowe,
but smaller: at the toppes of the stalkes growe small browne heads or
knaps, which shoote forth small purplish flowers, turning into long and
brownish, but a little cornered seede: the roote groweth downe deepe,
being small and brownish: the whole plant is of a stipticke or binding
taste or quality, but of a fine quicke sent, almost like Baulme.


        The Vse of Burnet.

        The greatest vse that Burnet is commonly put vnto, is to put a
        few leaues into a cup with Claret wine, which is presently to
        be drunke, and giueth a pleasant quicke taste thereunto, very
        delightfull to the palate, and is accounted a helpe to make
        the heart merrie. It is sometimes also while it is young, put
        among other Sallet herbes, to giue a finer rellish thereunto.
        It is also vsed in vulnerary drinkes, and to stay fluxes and
        bleedings, for which purposes it is much commended. It hath
        beene also much commended in contagious and pestilentiall agues.




CHAP. XIIII.

_Hippolapathum sativum, siue Rhabarbarum Monachorum._
Monkes Rubarbe or Patience.


Garden Patience is a kinde of Docke in all the parts thereof, but that
it is larger and taller then many others, with large and long greene
leaues, a great, strong, and high stalke, with reddish or purplish
flowers, and three square seede, like as all other Dockes haue: the
roote is great and yellow, not hauing any shew of flesh coloured veines
therein, no more then the other kinde with great round thin leaues,
commonly called _Hippolapathum rotundifolium_, Bastard Rubarbe, or
Monkes Rubarbe, the properties of both which are of very weake effect:
but I haue a kinde of round leafed Dock growing in my Garden, which was
sent me from beyond Sea by a worthy Gentleman, Mʳ. Dʳ. Matth. Lister,
one of the Kings Physitians, with this title, _Rhaponticum verum_,
and first grew with me, before it was euer seen or known elsewhere in
England, wᶜʰ by proof I haue found to be so like vnto the true Rubarbe,
or the Rha of Pontus, both for forme and colour, that I dare say it
is the very true Rubarbe, our climate only making it lesse strong in
working, lesse heauy, and lesse bitter in taste: For this hath great
and thicke rootes, as diuersly discoloured with flesh coloured veines
as the true Rubarbe, as I haue to shew to any that are desirous to see
and know it; and also other smaller sprayes or branches of rootes,
spreading from the maine great roote, which smaller branches may well
be compared to the _Rhaponticum_ which the Merchants haue brought vs,
which we haue seene to be longer and slenderer then Rubarbe, but of the
very same colour: this beareth so goodly large leaues, that it is a
great beauty in a garden to behold them: for I haue measured the stalke
of the leafe at the bottome next the roote to bee of the bignesse of
any mans thumbe; and from the roote to the leafe it selfe, to bee two
foote in length, and sometimes more; and likewise the leafe it selfe,
from the lower end where it is ioyned to the stalke, to the end or
point thereof, to bee also two foote in length, and sometimes more; and
also in the broadest part of the leafe, to be two foote or more ouer
in breadth: it beareth whitish flowers, contrary to all other Dockes,
and three square brownish seede as other Dockes doe, but bigger,
and therefore assuredly it is a Docke, and the true Rubarbe of the
Arabians, or at the least the true _Rhaponticum_ of the Ancients. The
figure of the whole plant I haue caused to be cut, with a dryed roote
as it grew in my garden by it selfe, and haue inserted it here, both
because Matthiolus giueth a false figure of the true Rubarbe, and that
this hath not been expressed and set forth by any before.


        The Vse of Patience, and of the Rubarbe.

        The leaues of Patience are often, and of many vsed for a
        pot-herbe, and seldome to any other purpose: the roote is
        often vsed in Diet-beere, or ale, or in other drinkes made by
        decoction, to helpe to purge the liuer, and clense the blood.
        The other Rubarbe or _Rhaponticum_, whereof I make mention, and
        giue you here the figure, I haue tryed, and found by experience
        to purge gently, without that astriction that is in the true
        Rubarbe is brought vs from the East Indies, or China, and is
        also lesse bitter in taste; whereby I coniecture it may bee
        vsed in hot and feauerish bodies more effectually, because it
        doth not binde after the purging, as the East India Rubarbe
        doth: but this must bee giuen in double quantitie to the other,
        and then no doubt it will doe as well: The leaues haue a fine
        acide taste: A syrrupe therefore made with the iuice and sugar,
        cannot but be very effectuall in deiected appetites, and hot
        fits of agues; as also to helpe to open obstructions of the
        liuer, as diuers haue often tryed, and found auaileable by
        experience.




CHAP. XV.

_Lapathum sanguineum._   Blood-wort.


Among the sorts of pot-herbes Bloode-worte hath alwayes beene accounted
a principall one, although I doe not see any great reason therein,
especially seeing there is a greater efficacie of binding in this
Docke, then in any of the other: but as common vse hath receiued it,
so I here set it downe. Blood-worte is one of the sorts of Dockes, and
hath long leaues like vnto the smaller yellow Dock, but striped with
red veines, and ouer-shadowed with red vpon the greene leafe, that it
seemeth almost wholly red sometimes: the stalke is reddish, bearing
such like leaues, but smaller vp to the toppe, where it is diuided
into diuers small branches, whereon grow purplish flowers, and three
square darke red seede, like vnto others: the roots are not great, but
somewhat long, and very red, abiding many yeares, yet sometimes spoiled
with the extremitie of winter.

        The whole and onely vse of the herbe almost, serueth for the
        pot, among other herbes, and, as I said before, is accounted a
        most especiall one for that purpose. The seede therof is much
        commended for any fluxe in man or woman, to be inwardly taken,
        and so no doubt is the roote, being of a stipticke qualitie.




CHAP. XVI.

_Oxalis siue Acetosa._   Sorrell.


Sorrell must needes bee reckoned with the Dockes, for that it is so
like vnto them in all things, and is of many called the sower Docke.
Of Sorrels there are many sorts, but I shall not trouble you with any
other in this place, then the common Garden Sorrell, which is most
knowne, and of greatest vse with vs; which hath tender greene long
leaues full of iuice, broade, and bicorned as it were, next vnto the
stalke, like as Arrach, Spinach, and our English Mercurie haue, of a
sharpe sower taste: the stalkes are slender, bearing purplish long
heads, wherein lye three square shining browne seede, like, but lesser
then the other: the root is smaller then any of the other Dockes, but
browne, and full of strings, and abideth without decaying, hauing
greene leaues all the winter, except in the very extremitie thereof,
which often taketh away all or most of his leaues.


        The Vse of Sorrell.

        Sorrell is much vsed in sawces, both for the whole, and the
        sicke, cooling the hot liuers, and stomackes of the sicke,
        and procuring vnto them an appetite vnto meate, when their
        spirits are almost spent with the violence of their furious or
        fierie fits; and is also of a pleasant relish for the whole,
        in quickning vp a dull stomacke that is ouer-loaden with euery
        daies plenty of dishes. It is diuers waies dressed by Cooks, to
        please their Masters stomacks.




CHAP. XVII.

_Buglossum luteum, siue Lingua Bouis._   Langdebeefe.


Vnto this place may well bee referred our ordinary Borage and Buglosse,
set forth in the former Booke, in regard of the properties whereunto
they are much employed, that is, to serue the pot among other herbes,
as is sufficiently knowne vnto all. And yet I confesse, that this herbe
(although it bee called _Buglossum luteum_, as if it were a kind of
Buglosse) hath no correspondency with Buglosse or Borage in any part,
sauing only a little in the leafe; & our Borage or Buglosse might
more fitly, according to the Greeke name, bee called Oxe tongue or
Langdebeefe; and this might in my iudgement more aptly be referred to
the kinds of _Hieratium_ Hawkeweed, whereunto it neerest approacheth:
but as it is commonly receiued, so take it in this place, vntill it
come to receiue the place is proper for it. It hath diuers broad and
long darke green leaues, lying vpon the ground, very rough in handling,
full of small haires or prickes, ready to enter into the hands of any
that handle it; among which riseth vp a round greene hairy or prickly
stalk, bearing at the toppe, among a few small green leaues, diuers
small yellow flowers in rough heads, which turne into doune, containing
within them browne yellowish small long seedes, somewhat like vnto the
seede of Hawkeweede: the roote is wooddy, which perisheth quickly after
it hath borne seed; but is tender while it is young.

        The Vse of Langdebeefe.

        The leaues are onely vsed in all places that I know, or euer
        could learne, for an herbe for the pot among others, and is
        thought to bee good to loosen the belly.




CHAP. XVIII.

_Atriplex siue Olus Aureum._   Arrach.


There be diuers kindes of Arrach, or Orach, as some doe call them;
some of the Garden, whereof I meane to entreate in this place; others
wilde of the Fieldes, &c. and others of the Sea, which are not to bee
spoken of in this worke, but referred to a generall historie. The
white garden Arrach, or Orach, hath diuers leaues, standing vpon their
seuerall footestalkes, broade at the bottome, ending in two points
like an arrow, with two feathers at the head, and small pointed at the
end of the leafe, of a whitish yellow greene colour, and as it were
strewed ouer with flower or meale, especially while they are young:
the stalke like wise is mealy, bearing many branches with small yellow
flowers on them, which turne into small leafie seeds: the roote groweth
somewhat deepe in the ground, with many small threds fastened thereto:
it quickly springeth vp of the seede, groweth great, and fadeth away as
soon as it hath borne seede.

The purple Arrach is in all things like vnto the white, sauing onely in
the colour of the leafe, stalke, seede, &c. which are all of a mealy
dusty purplish colour.


        The Vse of Arrach.

        Arrach is cold and moist, and of a lubricke or slippery
        qualitie, whereby it quickely passeth through the stomacke and
        belly, and maketh it soluble, and is of many vsed for that
        purpose, being boyled and buttered, or put among other herbes
        into the pot to make pottage.

        There are many dishes of meate made with them while they are
        young, for being almost without sauour of themselues, they are
        the more conuertible into what rellish any one will make them
        with Sugar, Spice &c.




CHAP. XIX.

_Blitum._   Blites.


There be diuers sorts of Blites, some whereof I haue entreated in
the former part of this worke, vnder the titled _Amaranthus_, Flower
gentle: others that are noursed vp in Gardens, I will set forth in
this place, which are onely two, that haue come to my knowledge, that
is, the white and the red, and are of a qualitie as neere vnto Arrach
as vnto Beetes, participating of both, and therefore I haue placed
them betwixt them. The white Blite hath leaues somewhat like vnto
Beetes, but smaller, rounder, and of a whitish greene colour, euery
one standing vpon a small long footestalke: the stalke riseth vp two
or three foote high, with many such like leaues thereon: the flowers
grow at the top in long round tufts or clusters, wherein are contained
small round seede: the roote is very full of threds or strings.

The red Blite is in all things like the white, but that his leaues and
tufted heades are exceeding red at the first, and after turne more
purplish.


        The Vse of Blites.

        Blites are vsed as Arrach, eyther boyled of it selfe or stewed,
        which they call Loblolly, or among other herbes to bee put into
        the pot; and yet some doe vtterly refuse it, because in diuers
        it prouoketh castings. It is altogether insipide or without
        taste, but yet by reason of the moist slipperie qualitie it
        hath, it helpeth to loosen the belly. The vnsauorinesse whereof
        hath in many Countries growne into a prouerbe, or by-word,
        to call dull, slow, or lazie persons by that name: They are
        accounted more hurtfull to the stomacke, and so to the head and
        eyes, then other herbes, and therefore they are the lesse vsed.




CHAP. XX.

_Beta._   Beetes.


There are many diuersities of Beetes, some growing naturally in our
own Country, others brought from beyond Sea; whereof some are white,
some greene, some yellow, some red: the leaues of some are of vse only,
and the root not vsed: others the roote is only vsed, and not the
leaues: and some againe, both roote and leafe. The ancient Authors, as
by their workes appeare, knew but two sorts, the white and the blacke
Beete, whereof the white is sufficiently known, and was of them termed
_Sicula_, of the later Physitians, _Sicla_, because it was thought
first to be brought from Sicilie: the blacke abideth some controuersie;
some thinking that our common greene Beete, because it is of a darke
greene colour, was that they called the blacke Beete; others that our
small red Beete, which is of a darke red colour, was their black Beete,
which in my opinion is the more likely: But to come to the matter in
hand, and giue you the descriptions of them which are in vse with vs,
and leaue controuersies to such a worke as is fit for them, wherein all
such matters may be discussed at large.

The common white Beete hath many great leaues next the ground (in some
hot Countries growing to be three foote long, and very broade, in our
Countrey they are very large, but nothing neere that proportion) of
a whitish greene colour; the stalke is great, strong, and ribbed or
crested, bearing great store of leaues vpon it vp to the very toppe
almost: the flowers grow in very long tufts, small at the ends, and
turning down their heads, which are small pale greenish yellow burres,
giuing cornered prickly seede: the roote is great, long and hard, when
it hath giuen seede, of no vse at all, but abideth a former winter with
his leaues vpon it, as all other sorts following doe.

The common red Beet differeth not from the white Beete, but only that
it is not so great, and both the leaues and rootes are somewhat red:
the leaues bee in some more red then in others, which haue but red
veines or strakes in them, in some also of a fresh red, in others very
darke red: the roote hereof is red, spongy, and not vsed to bee eaten.

The common greene Beete is also like vnto the white Beete, but of a
darke greene colour. This hath beene found neere the salt Marshes by
Rochester, in the foote-way going from the Lady Levesons house thither,
by a worthy, diligent and painefull obseruer and preseruer both of
plants and all other natures varieties, often remembred before in this
worke, called Iohn Tradescante, who there finding it, gaue me the
knowledge thereof, and I haue vpon his report set it here down in this
manner:

The Romane red Beete, called _Beta raposa_, is both for leafe and roote
the most excellent Beete of all others: his rootes bee as great as the
greatest Carrot, exceeding red both within and without, very sweete and
good, fit to bee eaten: this Beete groweth higher then the last red
Beete, whose rootes are not vsed to bee eaten: the leaues likewise are
better of taste, and of as red a colour as the former red Beete: the
roote is sometimes short like a Turnep, whereof it took the name of
_Rapa_ or _raposa_; and sometimes as I said before, like a Carrot and
long: the seede is all one with the lesser red Beete.

The Italian Beete is of much respect, whose faire greene leaues are
very large and great, with great white ribbes and veines therein: the
stalke in the Summer time, when it is growen vp to any height, is six
square in shew, and yellowish withall, as the heades with seede vpon
them seeme likewise.

The great red Beete that Master Lete a Merchant of London gaue vnto
Master Gerrard, as he setteth it downe in his Herball, seemeth to bee
the red kinde of the last remembred Beete, whose great ribbes as he
saith, are as great as the middle ribbe of the Cabbage leafe, and as
good to bee eaten, whose stalke rose with him to the height of eight
cubits, and bore plenty of seede.


        The Vse of Beetes.

        Beetes, both white, greene and red, are put into the pot among
        other herbes, to make pottage, as is commonly known vnto all,
        and are also boyled whole, both in France vsually with most
        of their boyled meates, and in our Countrey, with diuers that
        delight in eating of herbes.

        The Italian Beete, and so likewise the last red Beete with
        great ribbes, are boyled, and the ribbes eaten in sallets with
        oyle, vinegar and pepper, and is accounted a rare kinde of
        sallet, and very delicate.

        The roote of the common red Beete with some, but more
        especially the Romane red Beete, is of much vse among Cookes
        to trimme or set out their dishes of meate, being cut out into
        diuers formes and fashions, and is grown of late dayes into a
        great custome of seruice, both for fish and flesh.

        The rootes of the Romane red Beete being boyled, are eaten of
        diuers while they are hot with a little oyle and vinegar, and
        is accounted a delicate sallet for the winter; and being cold
        they are so vsed and eaten likewise.

        The leaues are much vsed to mollifie and open the belly, being
        vsed in the decoction of Glisters. The roote of the white kinde
        scraped, and made vp with a little honey and salt, rubbed on
        and layd on the belly, prouoketh to the stoole. The vse of
        eating Beetes is likewise held to bee helpefull to spleneticke
        persons.




CHAP. XXI.

_Hipposelinum, siue Olus atrum._   Alisanders.


Alisanders hath beene in former times thought to be the true Macedonian
Parsley, and in that errour many doe yet continue: but this place
giueth not leaue to discusse that doubt: but I must here only shew
you, what it is, and to what vse it is put ordinarily for the Kitchen.
The leaues of Alisanders are winged or cut into many parts, somewhat
resembling Smallage, but greater, broader, and more cut in about the
edges: the stalkes are round and great, two foote high or better,
bearing diuers leaues on them, and at the toppe spokie roundles of
white flowers on seuerall small branches, which turne into blacke
seede, somewhat cornered or crested, of an aromaticall bitter taste;
the roote is blacke without, and white within, and abideth well the
first year of the sowing, perishing after it hath borne seed.


        The Vse of Alisanders.

        The tops of the rootes, with the lower part of the stalkes of
        Alisanders, are vsed in Lent especially, and Spring of the
        yeare, to make broth, which although it be a little bitter, yet
        it is both wholsome and pleasing to a great many, by reason
        of the aromaticall or spicie taste, warming and comforting
        the stomack, and helping it digest the many waterish and
        flegmaticke meates are in those times much eaten. The rootes
        also either rawe or boyled are often eaten with oyle and
        vinegar. The seede is more vsed physically then the roote, or
        any other part, and is effectuall to prouoke plenty of vrine
        in them that pisse by drops, or haue the Strangury: It helpeth
        womens courses, and warmeth their benummed bodies or members,
        that haue endured fierce cold daies and nights, being boyled
        and drunke.




CHAP. XXII.

_Selinum dulce._   Sweete Parsley or sweete Smallage.


This kinde of sweete Parsley or Smallage, which soeuer you please to
call it, for it resembleth Smallage as well in the largenesse of the
leaues, as in the taste, yet sweeter and pleasanter, is (as I take it)
in this like vnto sweete Fennell (that hath his sweetnesse from his
naturall soyle and clymate; for howsoeuer it bee reasonable sweete
the first yeare it is sowne with vs, yet it quickly doth degenerate,
and becommeth no better then our ordinarie Fennell afterwards). The
first yeare it is sowne and planted with vs (and the first that euer I
saw, was in a Venetian Ambassadours Garden in the Spittle yard, neare
Bishops gate streete) is so sweete and pleasant, especially while it is
young, as if Sugar had beene mingled with it: but after it is growne vp
high and large, it hath a stronger taste of Smalladge, and so likewise
much more the next yeare; that it groweth from the seed was gathered
here: the leaues are many, spreading farre about the roote, broader and
of a fresher greene colour then our ordinary Smalladge, and vpon longer
stalkes: the seed is as plentifull as Parsley, being small and very
like vnto it, but darker of colour.


        The Vse of sweete Parsley.

        The Venetians vse to prepare it for meate many waies, both the
        herbe and the roote eaten rawe, as many other herbes and rootes
        are, or boyled or fryed to be eaten with meate, or the dryed
        herbe poudered and strewed vpon meate; but most vsually either
        whited, and so eaten rawe with pepper and oyle, as a dainty
        Sallet of it selfe, or a little boyled or stewed: the taste
        of the herbe being a little warming, but the seede much more,
        helpeth cold windy stomackes to digest their meate, and to
        expell winde.




CHAP. XXIII.

_Petrosolinum & Apium._   Parsley and Smalledge.


We haue three sorts of Parsley in our Gardens, and but one of
Smalladge: Our common Parsley, Curld Parsley, and Virginia Parsley;
which last, although it be but of late knowne, yet it is now almost
growne common, and of as good vse as the other with diuers. Our common
Parsley is so well knowne, that it is almost needlesse to describe it,
hauing diuers fresh greene leaues, three alwaies placed together on
a stalke, and snipt about the edges, and three stalkes of leaues for
the most part growing together: the stalkes growe three or foure foote
high or better, bearing spikie heads of white flowers, which turne into
small seede, somewhat sharpe and hot in taste: the roote is long and
white.

Curld Parsley hath his leaues curled or crumpled on the edges, and
therein is the onely difference from the former.

Virginia Parley is in his leafe altogether like vnto common Parsley
for the forme, consisting of three leaues set together, but that the
leaues are as large as Smallage leaues, but of a pale or whitish greene
colour, and of the same taste of our common Parsley: the seede hereof
is as the leaues, twice if not thrice as bigge as the ordinary Parsley,
and perisheth when it hath giuen seede, abiding vsually the first yeare
of the sowing.

Smallage is in forme somewhat like vnto Parsley, but greater and
greener, and lesse pleasant, or rather more bitter in taste: the seede
is smaller, and the root more stringy.


        The Vse of Parsley.

        Parsley is much vsed in all sorts of meates, both boyled,
        roasted, stewed, &c. and being greene it serueth to lay vpon
        sundry meates, as also to draw meate withall. It is also shred
        and stopped into poudered beefe, as also into legges of Mutton,
        with a little beefe suet among it, &c.

        The rootes are often vsed to be put into broth, to helpe to
        open obstructions of the liuer, reines, and other parts,
        helping much to procure vrine.

        The rootes likewise boyled or stewed with a legge of Mutton,
        stopped with Parsley as aforesaid, is very good meate, and
        of very good rellish, as I haue proued by the taste; but the
        rootes must bee young, and of the first yeares growth, and they
        will haue their operation to cause vrine.

        The seed also is vsed for the same cause, when any are troubled
        with the stone, or grauell, to open the passages of vrine.

        Although Smallage groweth in many places wilde in moist
        grounds, yet it is also much planted in Gardens, and although
        his euill taste and sauour doth cause it not to be accepted
        into meates as Parsley, yet it is not without many speciall
        good properties, both for outward and inward diseases, to helpe
        to open obstructions, and prouoke vrine. The iuyce cleanseth
        vlcers; and the leaues boyled with Hogs grease, healeth felons
        on the ioynts of the fingers.




CHAP. XXIIII.

_Fœniculum._   Fenell.


There are three sorts of Fenell, whereof two are sweete. The one
of them is the ordinary sweete Fenell, whose seedes are larger and
yellower then the common, and which (as I said before in the Chapter
of sweete Parsley) doth soone degenerate in this our Country into the
common. The other sweete Fenell is not much knowne, and called Cardus
Fenell by those that sent it out of Italy, whose leaues are more thicke
and bushie then any of the other. Our common Fenell, whereof there is
greene and red, hath many faire and large spread leaues, finely cut
and diuided into many small, long, greene, or reddish leaues, yet the
thicker tufted the branches be, the shorter are the leaues: the stalkes
are round, with diuers ioynts and leaues at them, growing fiue or six
foot high, bearing at the top many spoakie rundels of yellow flowers;
the Common, I meane, doth turne into a darke grayish flat seede, and
the Sweete into larger and yellower: the roote is great, long, and
white, and endureth diuers yeares.


        The Vse of Fenell.

        Fenell is of great vse to trimme vp, and strowe vpon fish, as
        also to boyle or put among fish of diuers sorts, Cowcumbers
        pickled, and other fruits, &c. The rootes are vsed with
        Parsley rootes, to be boyled in broths and drinkes to open
        obstructions. The seed is of much vse with other things to
        expell winde. The seede also is much vsed to be put into Pippin
        pies, and diuers other such baked fruits, as also into bread,
        to giue it the better rellish. The sweete Cardus Fenell being
        sent by Sir Henry Wotton to Iohn Tradescante, had likewise a
        large direction with it how to dresse it; for they vse to white
        it after it hath been transplanted for their vses, which by
        reason of the sweetnesse by nature, and the tendernesse by art,
        causeth it to be the more delightfull to the taste, especially
        with them that are accustomed to feede on greene herbes.

CHAP. XXV.

_Anethum._   Dill.


Dill doth much growe wilde, but because in many places it cannot
be had, it is therefore sowne in Gardens for the vses whereunto it
serueth. It is a smaller herbe then Fenell, but very like, hauing fine
cut leaues, not so large, but shorter, smaller, and of a stronger and
quicker taste: the stalke is smaller also, and with few ioynts and
leaues on them, bearing spoakie tufts of yellow flowers, which turne
into thinne, small, and flat seedes: the roote perisheth euery yeare,
and riseth againe for the most part of it owne sowing.


        The Vse of Dill.

        The leaues of Dill are much vsed in some places with Fish, as
        they doe Fenell; but because it is so strong many doe refuse it.

        It is also put among pickled Cowcumbers, wherewith it doth very
        well agree, giuing vnto the cold fruit a pretty spicie taste or
        rellish.

        It being stronger then Fenell, is of the more force to expell
        winde in the body. Some vse to eate the seed to stay the
        Hickocke.




CHAP. XXVI.

_Myrrhis siue Cerefolium maius & vulgare._
Sweet Cheruill and ordinary Cheruill.


The great or sweete Cheruill (which of some is called Sweete Cicely)
hath diuers great and faire spread winged leaues, consisting of many
leaues set together, deeply cut in the edges, and euery one also dented
about, very like, and resembling the leaues of Hemlockes, but of so
pleasant a taste, that one would verily thinke, he chewed the leaues or
seedes of Aniseedes in his mouth: The stalke is reasonable great, and
somewhat cornered or crested about three or foure foote high, at the
toppe whereof stand many white spoakie tufts of flowers, which change
into browne long cornered great seede, two alwaies ioyned together: the
roote is great, blackish on the outside, and white within, with diuers
fibres annexed vnto it, and perisheth not, but abideth many yeares, and
is of a sweete, pleasant, and spicie hot taste, delightfull vnto many.

The common Cheruill is a small herbe, with slender leaues, finely cut
into long peeces, at the first of a pale yellowish greene colour, but
when the stalke is growne vp to seede, both stalkes and leaues become
of a darke red colour: the flowers are white, standing vpon scattered
or thin spread tufts, which turne into small, long, round, and sharpe
pointed seedes, of a brownish blacke colour: the roote is small, with
diuers long slender white strings, and perisheth euery yeare.


        The Uses of these Cheruils.

        The common Cheruill is much vsed of the French and Dutch
        people, to bee boyled or stewed in a pipkin, eyther by it
        selfe, or with other herbes, whereof they make a Loblolly, and
        so eate it. It is vsed as a pot-herbe with vs.

        Sweete Cheruill, gathered while it is young, and put among
        other herbes for a sallet, addeth a meruellous good rellish to
        all the rest. Some commend the greene seedes diced and put in a
        sallet of herbes, and eaten with vinegar and oyle, to comfort
        the cold stomacke of the aged. The roots are vsed by diuers,
        being boyled, and after eaten with oyle and vinegar, as an
        excellent sallet for the same purpose. The preserued or candid
        rootes are of singular good vse to warme and comfort a cold
        flegmaticke stomack, and is thought to be a good preseruatiue
        in the time of the plague.




CHAP. XXVII.

_Malua Crispa._   French Mallowes.


The curld or French Mallow groweth vp with an vpright greene round
stalke, as high vsually as any man, whereon from all sides grow forth
round whitish greene leaues, curld or crumpled about the edges, like a
ruffe, else very like vnto an ordinary great Mallow leafe: the flowers
grow both vpon the stalke, and on the other branches that spring from
them, being small and white; after which come small cases with blacke
seede like the other Mallowes: the roote perisheth when it hath borne
seede, but abideth vsually the first yeare, and the second runneth vp
to flower and seede.


        The Vse of French Mallowes.

        It is much vsed as a pot-herbe, especially when there is cause
        to moue the belly downward, which by his slippery qualitie it
        doth helpe forward. It hath beene in times past, and so is to
        this day in some places, vsed to be boyled or stewed, eyther by
        it selfe with butter, or with other herbes, and so eaten.




CHAP. XXVIII.

_Imtubum._   Succorie and Endiue.


I put both Succorie and Endiue into one chapter and description,
because they are both of one kindred; and although they differ a little
the one from the other, yet they agree both in this, that they are
eaten eyther greene or whited, of many.

Endiue, the smooth as well as the curld, beareth a longer and a larger
leafe then Succorie, and abideth but one yeare, quickely running vp to
stalke and seede, and then perisheth: whereas Succorie abideth many
years, and hath long and narrower leaues, somewhat more cut in, or
torne on the edges: both of them haue blew flowers, and the seede of
the smooth or ordinary Endiue is so like vnto the Succorie, that it is
very hard to distinguish them asunder by sight; but the curld Endiue
giueth blackish and flat seede, very like vnto blacke Lettice seede:
the rootes of the Endiue perish, but the Succorie abideth.


        The Vse of Succory and Endiue.

        Although Succorie bee somewhat more bitter in taste then the
        Endiues, yet it is oftentimes, and of many eaten greene,
        but more vsually being buried a while in sand, that it may
        grow white, which causeth it to lose both some part of the
        bitternesse, as also to bee the more tender in the eating; and
        Horace sheweth it to be vsed in his time, in the 32. Ode of his
        first Book, where he saith,

    _Me pascunt Oliuæ, me Cithorea leuesqe Maluæ_.

        Endiue being whited in the same, or any other manner, is much
        vsed in winter, as a sallet herbe with great delight; but the
        curld Endiue is both farre the fairer, and the tenderer for
        that purpose.




CHAP. XXIX.

_Spinachia, siue Olus Hispanicum._   Spinach.


Spinach or Spinage is of three sorts (yet some doe reckon of foure,
accounting that herbe that beareth no seede to be a sort of it selfe,
when it is but an accident of nature, as it falleth out in Hempe,
Mercury, and diuers other herbes) two that bear prickly seed, the one
much greater then the other: the third that beareth a smooth seede,
which is more daintie, and noursed vp but in few Gardens: The common
Spinach which is the lesser of the two prickly sorts, hath long greene
leaues, broad at the stalke, and rent, or torne as it were into foure
corners, and sharpe pointed at the ends: it quickly runneth vp to
stalke, if it be sowen in the Spring time; but else, if at the end
of Summer, it will abide all the winter green, and then suddenly in
the very beginning of the Spring, runne vp to stalke, bearing many
leaues both below and at the toppe, where there doth appeare many smal
greenish flowers in clusters, and after them prickly seede: The other
greater sort that hath prickly seede, is in all things like the former
but larger both in stalke, leafe and seede. The smooth Spinach hath
broader, and a little rounder pointed leaues then the first, especially
the lower leaues; for those that grow vpwards vpon the stalke, are more
pointed, and as it were three square, of as darke a greene colour as
the former: at the seuerall ioynts of the stalkes and branches, stand
clustering many small greenish flowers, which turne into clusters of
round whitish seede, without any prickles at all vpon them: the roote
is long, white and small, like vnto the other, with many fibres at it:
If it be often cut, it will grow the thicker, or else spindle vp very
thinly, and with but few leaues vpon the stalke.


        The Vse of Spinage.

        Spinage is an herbe fit for sallets, and for diuers other
        purposes for the table only; for it is not knowne to bee vsed
        physically at all. Many English that haue learned it of the
        Dutch people, doe stew the herbe in a pot or pipkin, without
        any other moisture then it owne, and after the moisture is a
        little pressed from it, they put butter, and a little spice
        vnto it, and make therewith a dish that many delight to eate
        of. It is vsed likewise to be made into Tartes, and many other
        varieties of dishes, as Gentlewomen and their Cookes can better
        tell than my selfe; vnto whom I leaue the further ordering of
        these herbes, and all other fruits and rootes of this Garden:
        For I intend only to giue you the knowledge of them, with some
        briefe notes for their vse, and no more.

CHAP. XXX.

_Lactuca._   Lettice.


There are so many sorts, and so great diuersitie of Lettice, that I
doubt I shall scarce be beleeued of a great many. For I doe in this
Chapter reckon vp into you eleauen or twelue differing sorts; some of
little vse, others of more, being more common and vulgar; and some that
are of excellent vse and seruice, which are more rare, and require more
knowledge and care for the ordering of them, as also for their time of
spending, as some in the spring, some in summer, others in autumne,
and some being whited for the winter. For all these sorts I shall not
neede many descriptions, but only shew you which doe cabbage, and which
are loose, which of them are great or small, white, greene or red, and
which of them beare white seeds, and which of them blacke. And lastly
I haue thought good to adde another Sallet herbe, which because it is
called Lambes Lettice of many, or Corne Sallet of others, is put in
only to fill vp a number in this Chapter, and that I must speake of it,
and not that I thinke it to be any of the kindes of Lettice.

All sorts of Lettice, after a while that they haue closed themselues,
if they bee of the Cabbage kindes, or otherwise being loose, and neuer
closing, send forth from among the middle of their leaues a round
stalke (in some greater, in others lesser, according to their kinde)
full of leaues like vnto the lower, branching at the toppe into sundry
parts, whereon grow diuers small star-like flowers, of a pale yellowish
colour; after which come seede, eyther white or blackish, as the
plant yeeldeth, whereat hangeth some small peece of a cottony doune,
wherewith the whole head is stored, and is carried away with the winde,
if it be not gathered in time: the roote is somewhat long and white,
with some fibres at it, and perisheth quickely after the seede is ripe.

The Romane red Lettice is the best and greatest of all the rest. For
Iohn Tradescante that first, as I thinke, brought it into England, and
sowed it, did write vnto mee, that after one of them had been bound
and whited, when the refuse was cut away, the rest weighed seuenteene
ounces: this hath blacke seede.

The white Romane Lettice is like vnto it, hauing long leaues like a
Teasell, it is in goodnesse next vnto the red, but must be whited, that
it may eate kindly: the seede hereof is white.

The Virginia Lettice hath single and very broade reddish leaues, and is
not of any great regard, and therefore is kept but of a few: it beareth
blacke seede.

The common Lumbard Lettice that is loose, and another kinde thereof
that doth somewhat cabbage, haue both white seedes.

The Venice Lettice is an excellent Cabbage Lettice, and is best to bee
sowen after Midsummer for lateward Lettice; they be sometimes as great
as the crowne of a mans hatt: the seede hereof is white, and groweth to
be of a meane height.

Our common Cabbage Lettice is well known, and beareth blacke seede.

The curld Lettice which is open, and differeth but little from Endiue,
beareth black seede.

Another sort of curld Lettice doth cabbage, and is called Flanders
Cropers, or Cropers of Bruges; this groweth lowest, and hath the
smallest head, but very hard and round, and white while it groweth: the
seed is blacke.

A kinde of Romane Lettice is of a darke green colour, growing as low as
the Venice Lettice, and is an excellent kinde, bearing blacke seede.

And lastly our winter Lettice is wonderfull hardy to endure our cold:
It is but single, and must be sowen at Michaelmas, but will be very
good, before any of the other good sorts sowen in the Spring, will be
ready to be vsed, and beareth white seed.

To instruct a nouice (for I teach not a Gardiner of knowledge) how to
gather his seede that it may be good, is in this manner: Let him marke
out those plants that hee meaneth shall run vp for seede, which must
be the most likely; & after they haue begun to shoote forth stalkes,
strip away the lowest leaues, for two or three hands breadth aboue the
ground, that thereby in taking away the lowest leaues, the stalke doe
not rot, nor the seed be hindered in the ripening.

There are two manner of wayes to whiten Lettice to make them eate the
more tender: the one is by raysing vp earth like moale hils, round
about the plants while they are growing, which will make them grow
white: the other is by tying vp all the loose leaues round together
while it groweth, that so the close tying may make it grow white, and
thereby be the more tender.

Lambes Lettice or Corne Sallet is a small plant while it is young,
growing close vpon the ground, with many whitish greene, long and
narrow, round pointed leaues, all the winter, and in the beginning of
the spring (if it bee sowen in autumne, as it is vsuall to serue for an
early sallet) riseth vp with small round stalkes, with two leaues at
euery ioynt, branching forth at the toppe, and bearing tufts of small
bleake blew flowers, which turne into small round whitish seede: the
roote is small and long, with some small threds hanging thereat: the
whole plant is of a waterish taste, almost insipide.


        The Vse of Lettice.

        All sorts of Lettice are spent in sallets, with oyle and
        vinegar, or as euery one please, for the most part, while they
        are fresh and greene, or whited, as is declared of some of
        the sorts before, to cause them to eate the more delicate and
        tender. They are also boyled, to serue for many sorts of dishes
        of meate, as the Cookes know best.

        They all coole a hot and fainting stomacke.

        The iuice of Lettice applyed with oyle of Roses to the
        foreheads of the sicke and weake wanting sleepe, procureth
        rest, and taketh away paines in the head: bound likewise to the
        cods, it helpeth those that are troubled with the Colts euill.
        If a little camphire be added, it restraineth immoderate lust:
        but it is hurtfull to such as are troubled with the shortnesse
        of breath.

        Lambes Lettice is wholly spent for sallets, in the beginning of
        the yeare, as I said, before any almost of the other sorts of
        Lettice are to be had.




CHAP. XXXI.

_Portulaca._   Purslane.


Purslane hath many thicke round shining red stalkes, full of iuice,
lying vpon the ground for the most part; whereon are set diuers long,
thicke, pale green leaues, sometimes alone by themselues, and sometimes
many small ones together with them; among which grow small yellow
flowers, which stand in little greene huskes, containing blacke seede:
the roote is small, and perisheth euery yeare, and must be new sowen in
Aprill, in the alleyes of the Garden betweene the beds, as some haue
heretofore vsed, where it may haue the more moisture, or, as I haue
seene in some Gardens, vpon those beds of dung that Gardiners haue vsed
to nourse vp their Cowcumbers, Melons, and Pompions, whereon after they
haue been taken away, they haue sowen Purslane, where if it be much
watered, the warmth of the dung, and the water giuen it, the Purslane
hath grown great and large, and continued vntill winter.


        The Vse of Purslane.

        It is vsed as Lettice in sallets, to coole hot and faint
        stomackes in the hot time of the yeare, but afterwards if only
        for delight, it is not good to bee too prodigall in the vse
        thereof.

        The seede of Purslane doth coole much any inflammation inward
        or outward, and doth a little binde withall.




CHAP. XXXII.

_Dracoherba siue Tarchon & Dracunculus hortensis._ Tarragon.


Tarragon hath long and narrow darke greene leaues, growing on slender
and brittle round stalkes, two or three foote high, at the tops whereof
grow forth long slender spikes of small yellowish flowers, which
seldome giue any good seede, but a dustie or chaffie matter, which
flieth away with the winde: the roote is white, and creepeth about
vnder ground, whereby it much encreaseth: the whole herbe is of a hot
and biting taste.


        The Vse of Tarragon.

        It is altogether vsed among other cold herbes, to temper their
        coldnesse, and they to temper its heate, so to giue the better
        rellish vnto the Sallet; but many doe not like the taste
        thereof, and so refuse it.

        There are some Authors that haue held Tarragon not to be an
        herbe of it owne kinde, but that it was first produced, by
        putting the seede of Lin or Flaxe into the roote of an Onion,
        being opened and so set into the ground, which when it hath
        sprung, hath brought forth this herbe Tarragon, which absurd
        and idle opinion, Matthiolus by certaine experience saith, hath
        been found false.




CHAP. XXXIII.

_Nasturtium hortense._   Garden Cresses.


Garden Cresses growe vp to the height of two foote or thereabouts,
hauing many small, whitish, broad, endented, torne leaues, set together
vpon a middle ribbe next the ground, but those that growe higher vpon
the stalkes are smaller and longer: the tops of the stalkes are stored
with white flowers, which turne into flat pods or pouches, like vnto
Shepheard purse, wherein is contained flat reddish seede: the roote
perisheth euery yeare: the taste both of leaues and seedes are somewhat
strong, hot, and bitter.


        The Vse of Cresses.

        The Dutchmen and others vse to eate Cresses familiarly with
        their butter and bread, as also stewed or boyled, either alone
        or with other herbes, whereof they make a Hotch potch, and so
        eate it. Wee doe eate it mixed among Lettice or Purslane, and
        sometimes with Tarragon or Rocket, with oyle and vinegar and a
        little salt, and in that manner it is very sauoury to some mens
        stomackes.

        The vse of Cresses physically is, it helpeth to expectorate
        tough flegme, as also for the paines of the breast; and as it
        is thought taketh away spots, being laid to with vinegar. The
        seede is giuen of many to children for the wormes.

CHAP. XXXIIII.

_Eruca satiua._   Garden Rocket.


Ovr Garden Rocket is but a wilde kinde brought into Gardens; for the
true Romane Rocket hath larger leaues; this hath many long leaues, much
torne or rent on the edges, smaller and narrower then the Romane kinde:
the flowers hereof are of a pale yellowish colour, whereas the true
is whitish, consisting of foure leaues: the seede of this is reddish,
contained in smaller and longer pods then the true, which are shorter
and thicker, and the seede of a whitish yellow colour: the rootes of
both perish as soone as they haue giuen seede. Some haue taken one sort
of the wilde kinde for Mustard, and haue vsed the seede for the same
purpose.


        The Vse of Rocket.

        It is for the most part eaten with Lettice, Purslane, or such
        cold herbes, and not alone, because of its heate and strength;
        but that with the white seede is milder. The seede of Rocket is
        good to prouoke vrine, and to stirre vp bodily lust.

        The seede bruised, and mixed with a little vinegar, and of the
        gall of an Oxe, cleanseth the face of freckles, spots, and blew
        markes, that come by beatings, fals, or otherwaies.

        Matthiolus saith, that the leaues boyled, and giuen with some
        Sugar to little children, cureth them of the cough.

        The seede is held to be helpfull to spleneticke persons; as
        also to kill the wormes of the belly.




CHAP. XXXV.

_Sinapi sativum._   Garden Mustard.


The Mustard that is most vsuall in this Country, howsoeuer diuers
doe for their priuate vses sowe it in their Gardens or Orchards, in
some conuenient corner, yet the same is found wilde also abroad in
many places. It hath many rough long diuided leaues, of an ouerworne
greene colour: the stalke is diuided at the toppe into diuers branches,
whereon growe diuers pale yellow flowers, in a great length, which
turne into small long pods, wherein is contained blackish seede,
inclining to rednesse, of a fiery sharpe taste: the roote is tough and
white, running deepe into the ground, with many small fibres at it.


        The Vse of Mustard.

        The seede hereof grownd between two stones, fitted for the
        purpose, and called a Querne, with some good vinegar added vnto
        it, to make it liquid and running, is that kinde of Mustard
        that is vsually made of all sorts, to serue as sawce both for
        fish and flesh.

        The same liquid Mustard is of good vse, being fresh, for
        Epilepticke persons, to warme and quicken those dull spirits
        that are sopite and scarce appeare, if it be applyed both
        inwardly and outwardly.

        It is with good successe also giuen to those that haue short
        breathes, and troubled with a cough in the lungs.




CHAP. XXXVI.

_Asparagus._   Sperage or Asparagus.


Asparagus riseth vp at the first with diuers whitish greene scaly
heads, very brittle or easie to breake while they are young, which
afterwards rise vp into very long and slender greene stalkes, of
the bignesse of an ordinary riding wand at the bottome of most, or
bigger or lesser, as the rootes are of growth, on which are set diuers
branches of greene leaues, shorter and smaller then Fennell vp to
the toppe, at the ioynts whereof come forth small mossie yellowish
flowers, which turne into round berries, greene at the first, and of an
excellent red colour when they are ripe, shewing as if they were beades
of Corrall, wherein are contained exceeding hard and blacke seede: the
rootes are dispersed from a spongious head into many long, thicke, and
round strings, whereby it sucketh much nourishment out of the ground,
and encreaseth plentifully thereby.

We haue another kinde hereof that is of much greater account, because
the shootes are larger, whiter, and being dressed taste more sweete and
pleasant, without any other difference.


        The Vse of Asparagus.

        The first shootes or heads of Asparagus are a Sallet of as much
        esteeme with all sorts of persons, as any other whatsoeuer,
        being boyled tender, and eaten with butter, vinegar, and
        pepper, or oyle and vinegar, or as euery ones manner doth
        please; and are almost wholly spent for the pleasure of the
        pallate. It is specially good to prouoke vrine, and for those
        that are troubled with the stone or grauell in the reines or
        kidneyes, because it doth a little open and cleanse those parts.




CHAP. XXXVII.

_Brassica._   Cabbages and Coleworts.


There is greater diuersity in the forme and colour of the leaues of
this plant, then there is in any other that I know groweth vpon the
ground. But this place requireth not the knowledge of all sorts which
might be shewen, many of them being of no vse with vs for the table,
but for delight, to behold the wonderfull variety of the workes of
God herein. I will here therefore shew you onely those sorts that are
ordinary in most Gardens, and some that are rare, receiued into some
especiall Gardens: And first of Cabbages, and then of Coleworts.

Our ordinary Cabbage that closeth hard and round, hath at the first
great large thicke leaues, of a grayish greene colour, with thicke
great ribbes, and lye open most part of the Summer without closing, but
toward the end of Summer, being growne to haue many leaues, it then
beginneth to growe close and round in the middle, and as it closeth,
the leaues growe white inward; yet there be some kindes that will
neuer be so close as these, but will remaine halfe open, which wee doe
not account to be so good as the other: in the middle of this head,
the next yeare after the sowing, in other Countries especially, and
sometimes in ours, if the Winter be milde, as may be seene in diuers
Gardens (but to preuent the danger of our Winter frosts, our Gardiners
now doe vse to take vp diuers Cabbages with their rootes, and tying a
cloth or some such thing about the rootes, doe hang them vp in their
houses, where they may be defended from cold, and then set them againe
after the frosts are past) and then there shooteth out a great thicke
stalke, diuided at the toppe into many branches, bearing thereon diuers
small flowers, sometime white, but most commonly yellow, made of foure
leaues, which turne into long, round, and pointed pods, containing
therein small round seede, like vnto Turnep seede: the roote spreadeth
not farre nor deepe, and dyeth vsually in any great froste; for a small
frost maketh the Cabbage eate the tenderer.

The red Cabbage is like vnto the white, last spoken of, but differing
in colour and greatnesse; for it is seldome found so great as the
white, and the colour of the leaues is very variable, as being in some
stript with red, in others more red, or very deepe red or purple.

The sugar loafe Cabbage, so called because it is smaller at the toppe
then it is at the bottome, and is of two sorts, the one white, the
other greene.

The Sauoy Cabbadge, one is of a deepe greene coloured leafe, and curld
when it is to be gathered; the other is yellowish: neyther of both
these doe close so well as the first, but yet are vsed of some, and
accounted good.

The Cole flower is a kinde of Coleworte, whose leaues are large, and
like the Cabbage leaues, but somewhat smaller, and endented about the
edges, in the middle wherof, sometimes in the beginning of Autumne,
and sometimes much sooner, there appeareth a hard head of whitish
yellow tufts of flowers, closely thrust together, but neuer open, nor
spreading much with vs, which then is fittest to be vsed, the green
leaues being cut away close to the head: this hath a much pleasanter
taste then eyther the Coleworte, or Cabbage of any kinde, and is
therefore of the more regard and respect at good mens tables.

The ordinary Coleworte is sufficiently knowne not to close or cabbage,
and giueth seede plentifully enough.

The other Colewortes that are noursed vp with those that delight in
curiosities, besides the aforesaid ordinary greene, which is much vsed
of Dutchmen, and other strangers, are these: The Curld Coleworte eyther
wholly of a greene colour, or of diuers colours in one plant, as white,
yellow, red, purple or crimson, so variably mixed, the leaues being
curld on the edges, like a ruffe band, that it is very beautifull to
behold.

There is also another curld Colewort of lesse beauty and respect, being
but a little curld on the edges, whose leaues are white, edged with
red, or green edged with white.

Two other there are, the one of a popingaye greene colour: the other of
a fine deepe greene, like vnto the Sauoyes.

Then there is the Cole rape, which is also a kinde of Coleworte, that
beareth a white heade, or headed stalke aboue the ground, as bigge as
a reasonable Turnep, but longer, and from the toppe thereof springeth
out diuers great leaues, like vnto Colewortes; among which rise diuers
stalkes that beare yellow flowers, and seede in pods, almost as small
as Mustard seede: the roote is somewhat long, and very bushie with
threds.


        The Vse of Cabbages and Colewortes.

        They are most vsually boyled in poudered beefe broth vntil they
        be tender, and then eaten with much fat put among them.

        The great ribs of the Popingay, and deepe greene Colewortes,
        beeing boyled and layde into dishes, are serued to the table
        with oyle and vinegar in the Lent time for very good sallets.

        In the cold Countries of Russia and Muscouia, they pouder vp
        a number of Cabbages, which serue them, especially the poorer
        sort, for their most ordinary foode in winter; and although
        they stinke most grieuously, yet to them they are accounted
        good meate.

        It is thought, that the vse of them doth hinder the milke
        in Nurses breasts, causing it to dry vp quickely: but many
        women that haue giuen sucke to my knowledge haue denyed that
        assertion, affirming that they haue often eaten them, and found
        no such effect. How it might proue in more delicate bodies then
        theirs that thus said, I cannot tell but Matthiolus auerreth
        it to encrease milke in Nurses breastes; so differing are the
        opinions of many. The seede grossely bruised and boyled a
        little in flesh broth, is a present remedie for the Collicke;
        the seede and the broth being taken together, easing them that
        are troubled therewith of all griping paines: as also for
        the stone in the kidneyes. A Lohoc or licking Electuary made
        of the pulpe of the boyled stalkes, and a little honey and
        Almond milke, is very profitable for shortnesse of breath, and
        those that are entering into a Consumption of the lunges. It
        hath beene formerly held to be helpefull in all diseases: for
        Crisippus, an ancient Physitian, wrote a whole Volume of the
        vertues, applying it to all the parts of the body: which thing
        neede not seeme wonderfull, in that it is recorded by writers,
        that the old Romanes hauing expelled Physitians out of their
        Common-wealth, did for many hundred of yeares maintaine their
        health by the vse of Cabbages, taking them for euery disease.

CHAP. XXXVIII.

_Sisarum._   Skirrets.


After all the herbes before rehearsed, fit for sallets, or otherwise
to bee eaten, there must follow such rootes as are vsed to the same
purpose: and first, Skirrets haue many leaues next the ground, composed
of many small smooth green leaues, set each against other vpon a middle
ribbe, and euery one snipt about the edges: the stalke riseth vp two or
three foote high, set with the like leaues, hauing at the toppe spoakie
tufts of white flowers, which turne into small seede, somewhat bigger
and darker then Parsley seede: the rootes be many growing together
at one head, beeing long, slender, & rugged or vneuen, of a whitish
colour on the outside, and more white within, hauing in the middle of
the roote a long small hard pith or string: these heads are vsually
taken vp in February and March, or sooner if any so please, the greater
number of them being broken off to bee vsed, the rest are planted
againe after the heads are separated, and hereby they are encreased
euery yeare by many; but it is now adayes more sowen of the seed, which
come forwards well enough if the ground be fat and good.


        The Vse of Skirrets.

        The rootes being boyled, peeled and pithed, are stewed with
        butter, pepper and salt, and so eaten; or as others vse them,
        to roule them in flower, and fry them with butter, after they
        haue beene boyled, peeled and pithed: each way, or any way that
        men please to vse them, they may finde their taste to be very
        pleasant, far beyond any Parsnep, as all agree that taste them.

        Some doe vse also to eate them as a sallet, colde with vinegar,
        oyle, &c. being first boyled and dressed as before said. They
        doe helpe to prouoke vrine, and as is thought, to procure
        bodily lust, in that they are a little windy.




CHAP. XXXIX.

_Pastinaca satiua latifolia._   Parsneps.


The common garden Parsnep hath diuers large winged leaues lying vpon
the ground, that is, many leaues set one by another on both sides of
a middle stalk, somewhat like as the Skirret hath, but much larger,
and closer set: the stalke riseth vp great and tall, fiue or six foot
high sometimes, with many such leaues thereon at seuerall ioynts; the
top whereof is spread into diuers branches, whereon stand spoakie
rundles of yellow flowers, which turne into brownish flat seede: the
root is long, great and white, very pleasant to bee eaten, and the more
pleasant if it grow in a fat sandy soyle.

There is another sort of garden Parsnep, called the Pine Parsnep, that
is not common in euery Garden, and differeth from the former in three
notable parts. The root is not so long, but thicker at the head and
smaller below; the stalke is neither so bigge, nor so high; and the
seede is smaller: yet as Iohn Tradescante saith (who hath giuen me the
relation of this, and many other of these garden plants, to whom euery
one is a debtor) the roote hereof is not altogether so pleasant as the
other.

Moreouer the wilde kinde, which groweth in many places of England (and
wherof in some places there might be gathered a quarter sacke full of
the seede) if it be sowen in Gardens, and there well ordered, will
proue as good as the former kinde of Garden Parsneps.

        The Vse of Parsneps.

        The Parsnep root is a great nourisher, and is much more vsed in
        the time of Lent, being boyled and stewed with butter, then in
        any other time of the yeare; yet it is very good all the winter
        long. The seede helpeth to dissolue winde, and to prouoke vrine.




CHAP. XL.

_Pastina satiua tenuifolia._   Carrots.


The Carrot hath many winged leaues, rising from the head of the roote,
which are much cut and diuided into many other leaues, and they also
cut and diuided into many parts, of a deepe greene colour, some whereof
in Autumne will turne to be of a fine red or purple (the beautie
whereof allureth many Gentlewomen oftentimes to gather the leaues,
and sticke them in their hats or heads, or pin them on their armes in
stead of feathers): the stalke riseth vp among the leaues, bearing
many likewise vpon it, but nothing so high as the Parsnep, being about
three foote high, bearing many spoakie tufts of white flowers, which
turne into small rough seede, as if it were hairy, smelling reasonable
well if it bee rubbed: the roote is round and long, thicke aboue and
small below, eyther red or yellow, eyther shorter or longer, according
to his kinde; for there is one kinde, whose roote is wholly red quite
thoroughout; another whose roote is red without for a pretty way
inward, but the middle is yellow.

Then there is the yellow, which is of two sorts, both long and short:
One of the long yellow sorts, which is of a pale yellow, hath the
greatest and longest roote, and likewise the greatest head of greene,
and is for the most part the worst, being spongy, and not firme.

The other is of a deepe gold yellow colour, and is the best, hauing a
smaller head, or tuft of greene leaues vpon it.

The shorte rootes are likewise distinguished, into pale and deepe
yellow colours.


        The Vse of Carrots.

        All these sorts being boyled in the broth of beefe, eyther
        fresh or salt, but more vsually of salted beefe, are eaten with
        great pleasure, because of the sweetenesse of them: but they
        nourish lesse then Parsneps or Skirrets.

        I haue not often knowne the seede of this Garden kinde to bee
        vsed in Physicke: but the wilde kinde is often and much vsed to
        expell winde, &c.




CHAP. XLI.

_Rapum hortense._   Turneps.


There are diuers sorts of Turneps, as white, yellow, and red: the white
are the most common, and they are of two kinds, the one much sweeter
then the other.

The yellow and the red are more rare, and noursed vp only by those that
are curious: as also the Navewe, which is seene but with very few.

The ordinary Garden Turnep hath many large, and long rough greene
leaues, with deepe and vneuen gashes on both sides of them: the stalke
riseth vp among the leaues about two foote high, spread at the toppe
into many branches, bearing thereon yellow flowers, which turne into
long pods, with blackish round seede in them: the roote is round and
white, some greater, some smaller; the best kinde is knowne to be
flat, with a small pigges tale-like roote vnderneath it; the worser
kinde which is more common in many places of this land, both North and
West, is round, and not flat, with a greater pigges tayle-like roote
vnderneath.

The yellow kinde doth often grow very great, it is hardly discerned
from the ordinary kinde while it groweth, but by the greatnesse and
spreading of the leaues beeing boyled, the roote changeth more yellow,
somewhat neare the colour of a Carrot.

The red Turnep groweth vsually greater then any of the other,
especially in a good ground, being of a faire red colour on the
outside, but being pared, as white as any other on the inside. This,
as Matthiolus saith, doth grow in the Countrey of Anania, where hee
hath seene an infinite number of them that haue waighed fifty pound
a peece, and in some places hee saith, a hundred pound a peece, both
which we would thinke to be incredible, but that we see the kind is
greatly giuen to grow, and in warme Countries they may so thriue, that
the bulke or bignesse of the roote may so farre passe the growth of our
Countrey, as that it may rise to that quantity aboue specified.

The Navew gentle is of two kindes, a smaller and a greater; the smaller
is vsually called in France, _Naveau de Cane_, the roote is somewhat
long with the roundnesse; this kinde is twice as bigge as a mans
thumbe, and many of them lesse: The other is long and great, almost as
big as the short Carrot, but for the most part of an vneuen length, and
roundnesse vnto the very end, where it spreadeth into diuers small long
fibres: neyther of them doth differ much from the Turnep, in leafe,
flower or seed.


        The Vse of Turneps.

        Being boyled in salt broth, they all of them eate most kindly,
        and by reason of their sweetnesse are much esteemed, and often
        seene as a dish at good mens tables: but the greater quantitie
        of them are spent at poore mens feasts. They nourish much, and
        engender moist and loose flesh, and are very windy. The seede
        of the Navew gentle is (as I take it) called of Andromachus
        in the composition of his Treakle, _Bunias dulcis_: for
        Dioscorides and Plinie doe both say, that the seede of the tame
        Bunias or Napus is put into Antidotes, and not the seede of
        the wilde, which is more sharpe and bitter; neyther the seede
        of the Turnep, which is called in Greeke γογγύλη, in Latine
        _Rapum_, because the seede is not sweete.




CHAP. XLII.

_Raphanus._   Raddish.


There are two principall kindes of Garden Raddish, the one is blackish
on the outside, and the other white; and of both these there is some
diuision againe, as shall be shewed. Dittander and horse Raddish be
reckoned kinds thereof.

The ordinary Raddish hath long leaues, vneuenly gashed on both sides,
the stalke riseth vp to the height of three or foure foote, bearing
many purplish flowers at the top, made of foure leaues a peece, which
turne into thicke and short pods, wherein are contained round seede,
greater then Turnep or Coleworte seede, and of a pale reddish colour:
the roote is long, white, and of a reddish purple colour on the outside
toward the toppe of it, and of a sharpe biting taste.

There is a small kind of Raddish that commeth earlier then the former,
that we haue had out of the low Countries, not differing in any thing
else.

The blacke Raddish I haue had brought me out of the lowe Countries,
where they sell them in some places by the pound, and is accounted with
them a rare winter sallet: the roote of the best kinde is blackish on
the outside (and yet the seede gathered from such an one, hath after
the sowing againe, giuen rootes, whereof some haue beene blacke, but
the most part white on the outside) and white within, great and round
at the head, almost like a Turnep, but ending shorter then a Raddish,
and longer then a Turnep, almost peare-fashion, of a firmer and harder
substance then the ordinary Raddish, but no lesse sharpe and biting,
and somewhat strong withall; the leaues are somewhat smaller, and with
deeper gashes, the flower and seede are like the former, but smaller.

Another sort of blacke Raddish is like in leafe and seede to the
former, but the flower is of a lighter purple colour: the roote is
longer and smaller, and changeth also to bee white as the former doth,
so that I thinke they haue both risen from one kinde.

The Horse Raddish is a kinde of wilde Raddish, but brought into Gardens
for the vse of it, and hath great large and long greene leaues, which
are not so much diuided, but dented about the edges: the roote is long
and great, much stronger in taste then the former, and abideth diuers
yeares, spreading with branches vnder ground.

Dittander is likewise a wilde kinde hereof, hauing long pointed blewish
greene leaues, and a roote that creepeth much vnder ground: I confesse
this might haue bin placed among the herbes, because the leaues and not
the rootes are vsed; but let it passe now with the kindes of Raddish.


        The Vse of these Raddishes.

        Raddishes doe serue vsually as a _stimulum_ before meat, giuing
        an appetite thereunto; the poore eate them alone with bread and
        salt. Some that are early sowen, are eaten in Aprill, or sooner
        if the season permit; others come later; and some are sowen
        late to serue for the end of Summer: but (as of all things
        else) the earlier are the more accepted.

        The blacke Raddishes are most vsed in the winter, (yet some in
        their naturall and not forc’d grounds, haue their rootes good
        most part of the Summer) and therefore must bee sowen after
        Midsomer; for if they should bee sowen earlier, they would
        presently runne vp to stalke and seed, and so lose the benefit
        of the roote. The Physicall propertie is, it is often vsed in
        medicines that helpe to breake the stone, and to auoyde grauell.

        The Horse Raddish is vsed Physically, very much in
        Melancholicke, Spleneticke and Scorbuticke diseases. And some
        vse to make a kinde of Mustard with the rootes, and eate it
        with fish.

        Dittander or Pepperworte is vsed of some cold churlish
        stomackes, as a sawce or sallet sometimes to their meate, but
        it is too hot, bitter and strong for weake and tender stomackes.

        Our Gardiners about London vse great fences of reede tyed
        together, which seemeth to bee a mat set vpright, and is as
        good as a wall to defend the cold from those things that would
        be defended, and to bring them forwards the earlier.

Wee haue diuers sorts of Onions, both white and red, flat, round and
long, as shall be presently shewed: But I will doe with these as I
doe with the rest, only giue you one description for them all, and
afterwards their seuerall names and varieties, as they are to be known
by.

Our common Garden Onion hath diuers long greene hollow leaues, seeming
halfe flat; among which riseth vp a great round hollow stalke, bigger
in the middle then any where else, at the toppe whereof standeth a
close round head, couered at the first with a thin skinne, which
breaketh when the head is growne, and sheweth forth a great vmbell of
white flowers, which turne into blacke seede: but then the head is so
heauie that the stalke cannot sustaine it, but must be vpheld from
falling to the ground, lest it rot and perish: the roote as all know
is round, in some greater, in others lesser, or flat, in some red on
the outside only, in others quite thorough out, in some white, and
very sharpe and strong, in others milder, and more pleasant, and some
so pleasant that they may be eaten as an Apple: All these kinds of
Onions, contrary to the nature of all other bulbous rootes, haue no
off-set, or other roote growing to it, but are euery one alone single
by themselues; and therefore it seemeth, the Latines, as Columella
recordeth, haue giuen it the name _Vnio_, and the French it should
seeme following the Latine, and the English the French, do call it
_Oignon_ and _Onion_, as an vnite, or as if they were but one and one,
and dye euery yeare after seed bearing.

The red flat kinde is most vsually with vs the strongest of them all,
yet I haue had a great red Onion brought mee from beyond Sea, that was
as great almost as two mens fistes, flat and red quite thoroughout,
and very pleasant both to smell vnto, and to eate, but did quickly
degenerate; so that we plainly see, that the soyle and climate doth
giue great alteration to plants of all sorts.

The long kinde wee call St. Omers Onions, and corruptly among the
vulgar, St. Thomas Onions.

The other red kinde we call Strasborough Onions, whose outside onely is
red, and are very sharpe and fierce.

The white Onions both long and flat, are like vnto Chalke-stones lying
vpon the ground, when they are ripe and fit to be gathered.

And lastly, there is the Spanish Onion, both long and flat, very
sweete, and eaten by many like an apple, but as Iohn Tradescante saith,
who hath beene in Spaine, that the Spaniards themselues doe not eate
them so familiarly, as they doe those white Onions that come out of our
owne Countrey, which they haue there more plentifully then their sweete
Onions.


        The Vse of Onions.

        Onions are vsed many wayes, as sliced and put into pottage, or
        boyled and peeled and layde in dishes for sallets at supper,
        or sliced and put into water, for a sawce for mutton or
        oysters, or into meate roasted being stuffed with Parsly, and
        so many waies that I cannot recount them, euery one pleasing
        themselues, according to their order, manner or delight.

        Onions boyled or rosted vnder the embers, and mixed with sugar
        and butter, are good for those that are troubled with coughes,
        shortnesse of breath, and wheesing. An Onion made hollow at the
        bottome, and some good Treakle put into it, with a little iuyce
        of Citrons (or Lemons in the stead thereof) being well baked
        together vnder the embers, after the hole is stopped againe,
        and then strained forth, and giuen to one that hath the plague,
        is very helpefull, so as hee be laid to sweate vpon it.

        The iuice of Onions is much vsed to be applyed to any burnings
        with fire, or with Gun-pouder, or to any scaldings with water
        or oyle, and is most familiar for the Country, where vpon such
        sudden occasions they haue not a more fit or speedy remedie at
        hand: The strong smell of Onions, and so also of Garlicke and
        Leekes, is quite taken away from offending the head or eyes, by
        the eating of Parsley leaues after them.




CHAP. XLIIII.

_Porrum._   Leekes.


There be likewise sundry sorts of Leekes, both great and small. Leekes
are very like vnto Onions, hauing long green hollow-like leaues,
flattish on the one side, and with a ridge or crest on the backe side:
if they bee suffered to grow vncut, then in the second or third yeare
after the sowing, they will send forth a round and slender stalke,
euen quite throughout, and not swollen or bigger in the middle like
the Onion, bearing at the toppe a head of purplish flowers, and blacke
seede after them, very like vnto Onion seede, that it is hard to
distinguish them: the root is long and white, with a great bush of
fibres hanging at it, which they call the beards.

The vnset Leeke hath longer and slenderer roots then the other, which
being transplanted, groweth thicker and greater.

The French Leeke, which is called the Vine Leeke, is the best of all
others.

Our common kinde is of two sorts, one greater then another.

Another sort encreaseth altogether by the roote, as Garlicke doth.

And then Ciues, which are the smallest, and encrease aboundantly only
by the root.

Some doe account Scalions to be rather a kinde of Onions then Leekes,
and call them _Cepa Ascalonica_, or _Ascalonitides_, which will quickly
spend it selfe, if it be suffered to be vncut; but all Authors affirme,
that there is no wilde kinde of Onion, vnlesse they would haue it to be
_Gethyum_, whereof Theophrastus maketh mention, saying, that it hath
a long necke (and so these Scalions haue) and was also of some called
_Gethyllides_, which antiquity accounted to be dedicated to Latona, the
mother of Apollo, because when she was bigge with childe of Apollo, she
longed for these Leekes.


        The Vse of Leekes.

        The old World, as wee finde in Scripture, in the time of the
        children of Israels being in Egypt, and no doubt long before,
        fed much vpon Leekes, Onions, and Garlicke boyled with flesh;
        and the antiquity of the Gentiles relate the same manner
        of feeding on them, to be in all Countries the like, which
        howsoeuer our dainty age now refuseth wholly, in all sorts
        except the poorest; yet Muscouia and Russia vse them, and the
        Turkes to this day, (as Bellonius writeth) obserue to haue
        them among their dishes at their tables, yea although they
        be _Bashas_, _Cades_, or _Vaiuodas_, that is to say, Lords,
        Iudges, or Gouernours of countries and places. They are vsed
        with vs also sometimes in Lent to make pottage, and is a great
        and generall feeding in Wales with the vulgar Gentlemen.

        Ciues are vsed as well to be shred among other herbes for the
        pot, as to be put into a Sallet among other herbs, to giue it a
        quicker relish.

        Leekes are held to free the chest and lungs from much
        corruption and rotten flegme, that sticketh fast therein, and
        hard to be auoided, as also for them that through hoarsenesse
        haue lost their voice, if they be eyther taken rawe, or boyled
        with broth of barley, or some such other supping, fit and
        conducing thereunto. And baked vnder hot embers is a remedy
        against a surfeit of Mushromes.

        The greene blades of Leekes being boyled and applyed warme to
        the _Hemorrhoides_ or piles, when they are swolne and painfull,
        giue a great deale of ease.




CHAP. XLV.

_Allium._   Garlicke.


I Haue spoken of diuers sorts of Garlicke called Moly, in the former
booke: I shall neede in this place to shew onely those kindes, that
this Garden nourseth vp, and leaue the rest to his fit time and place.

Garlicke hath many long greene leaues, like vnto Onions, but much
larger, and not hollow at all as Onions are; the stalke riseth vp to
be about three foote high, bearing such a head at the toppe thereof as
Onions and Leekes doe, with purplish flowers, and blacke seede like
Leekes: the roote is white within, couered ouer with many purplish
skins, and is diuided into many parts or cloues, which serue both to
set againe for increase, and also to vse as neede shall require, and is
of a very strong smell and taste, as euery one knoweth, passing either
Onions or Leekes, but exceeding wholsome withall for them that can take
it.


_Allium Vrsinum._   Ramsons.

Ramsons are another kinde of Garlicke, and hath two or three faire
broade leaues, of a fresh or light greene colour, pointed at the end:
the stalke groweth about an hand length high, bearing many small and
pure white starre-like flowers at the toppe, and afterwards small,
blacke, and smooth round seede: the roote is also diuided into many
parts, whereby it is much encreased, and is much milder then the
former, both in smell and taste.


        The Vse of Garlicke.

        It being well boyled in salt broth, is often eaten of them
        that haue strong stomackes, but will not brooke in a weake and
        tender stomacke.

        It is accounted, and so called in diuers Countries, The poore
        mans Treakle, that is, a remedy for all diseases. It is neuer
        eaten rawe of any man that I know, as other of the rootes
        aforesaid, but sodden alwaies and so taken.

        Ramsons are oftentimes eaten with bread and butter, and
        otherwise also, as euery mans affection and course of life
        leadeth him to vse.




CHAP. XLVI.

_Rapunculus siue Rapuntium._   Rampions.


Garden Rampions are of two sorts, the one greater, the other lesser:
the leaues of Rampions are in the one somewhat broad like a Beete, in
the other somewhat long and narrow, and a little broader at the end, of
a light greene colour, lying flat vpon the ground all the first winter,
or yeare of the springing, and the next Spring shooteth forth stalkes
two or three foote high, bearing at the toppe, in the bigger sort, a
long slender spike of small horned or crooked flowers, which open their
brimmes into foure leaues; in the lesser many small purplish bels,
standing vpon seuerall small foote-stalkes, which turne into heads,
bearing small blackish seede: the root is white, branched into two or
three rootes, of the bignesse and length of a mans finger or thumbe.


        The Vse of Rampions.

        The rootes of both are vsed for Sallets, being boyled, and then
        eaten with oyle and vinegar, a little salt and pepper.




CHAP. XLVII.

_Tragopogon._   Goates beard.


Goates beard hath many long and narrow leaues, broader at the bottome,
and sharper at the end, with a ridge downe the backe of the leafe, and
of a pale greene colour; among which riseth vp a stalke of two or three
foote high, smooth and hollow, bearing thereon many such like leaues,
but smaller and shorter, and at the toppe thereof on euery branch a
great double yellow flower, like almost vnto the flower of a Dandelion,
which turneth into a head, stored with doune, and long whitish seede
therein, hauing on the head of euery one some part of the doune, and
is carried away with the winde if it bee neglected: the roote is long
and round, somewhat like vnto a Parsnep, but farre smaller, blackish on
the outside, and white within, yeelding a milkie iuyce being broken, as
all the rest of the plant doth, and of a very good and pleasant taste.
This kinde, as also another with narrower leaues, almost like grasse,
growe wilde abroad in many places, but are brought into diuers Gardens.
The other two kindes formerly described in the first part, the one with
a purple flower, and the other with an ash-coloured, haue such rootes
as these here described, and may serue also to the same purpose, being
of equall goodnesse, if any will vse them in the same manner; that is,
while they are young, and of the first yeares sowing, else they all
growe hard, in running vp to seede.


        The Vse of Goates beard.

        If the rootes of any of these kindes being young, be boyled and
        dressed as a Parsnep, they make a pleasant dish of meate, farre
        passing the Parsnep in many mens iudgements, and that with
        yellow flowers to be the best.

        They are of excellent vse being in this manner prepared, or
        after any other fit and conuenient way, to strengthen those
        that are macilent, or growing into any consumption.




CHAP. XLVIII.

_Carum._   Carawayes.


Carawayes hath many very fine cut and diuided leaues lying on the
ground, being alwaies greene, somewhat resembling the leaues of
Carrots, but thinner, and more finely cut, of a quicke, hot, and spicie
taste: the stalke riseth not much higher then the Carrot stalke,
bearing some leaues at the ioynts along the stalke to the toppe, where
it brancheth into three or foure parts, bearing spoakie vmbels of white
flowers, which turne into small blackish seede, smaller then Aniseede,
and of a hotter and quicker taste: the roote is whitish, like vnto a
Parsnep, but much smaller, more spreading vnder ground, and a little
quicke in taste, as all the rest of the plant is, and abideth long
after it hath giuen seede.


        The Vse of Carawayes.

        The rootes of Carawayes being boyled may be eaten as Carrots,
        and by reason of the spicie taste doth warme and comfort a cold
        weake stomacke, helping to dissolue winde (whereas Carrots
        engender it) and to prouoke vrine, and is a very welcome
        and delightfull dish to a great many, yet they are somewhat
        stronger in taste then Parsneps.

        The seede is much vsed to bee put among baked fruit, or into
        bread, cakes, &c. to giue them a rellish, and to helpe to
        digest winde in them are subiect thereunto.

        It is also made into Comfits, and put into _Trageas_, or as we
        call them in English, Dredges, that are taken for the cold and
        winde in the body, as also are serued to the table with fruit.




CHAP. XLIX.

_Pappas siue Battatas._   Potatoes.


Three sorts of Potatoes are well knowne vnto vs, but the fourth I rest
doubtfull of, and dare not affirme it vpon such termes as are giuen
vnto it, vntill I may be better informed by mine owne sight.

The Spanish kinde hath (in the Islands where they growe, either
naturally, or planted for increase, profit, and vse of the Spaniards
that nourse them) many firme and verie sweete rootes, like in shape and
forme vnto Asphodill rootes, but much greater and longer, of a pale
browne on the outside, and white within, set together at one head; from
whence rise vp many long branches, which by reason of their weight and
weaknesse, cannot stand of themselues, but traile on the ground a yard
and a halfe in length at the least (I relate it, as it hath growne with
vs, but in what other forme, for flower or fruit, we know not) whereon
are set at seuerall distances, broad and in a manner three square
leaues, somewhat like triangled Iuie leaues, of a darke greene colour,
the two sides whereof are broad and round, and the middle pointed at
the end, standing reasonable close together: thus much we haue seene
growe with vs, and no more: the roote rather decaying then increasing
in our country.

The Potatoes of Virginia, (Bauhinus vpon Matthiolus calleth it,
_Solanum tuberosum esculentum_ which some foolishly call the Apples
of youth) is another kinde of plant, differing much from the former,
sauing in the colour and taste of the roote, hauing many weake and
somewhat flexible branches, leaning a little downwards, or easily borne
downe with the winde or other thing, beset with many winged leaues,
of a darke grayish greene colour, whereof diuers are smaller, and
some greater then others: the flowers growe many together vpon a long
stalke, comming forth from betweene the leaues and the great stalkes,
euery one seuerally vpon a short foot-stalke, somewhat like the flower
of Tabacco for the forme, being one whole leafe six cornered at the
brimmes, but somewhat larger, and of a pale blewish purple colour,
or pale doue colour, and some almost white, with some red threads in
the middle, standing about a thicke gold yellow pointell, tipped with
greene at the end: after the flowers are past, there come vp in their
places small round fruit, as bigge as a Damson or Bulleis, greene at
the first, and somewhat whitish afterwards, with many white seedes
therein, like vnto Nightshade: the rootes are rounder and much smaller
then the former, and some much greater then others, dispersed vnder
ground by many small threads or strings from the rootes, of the same
light browne colour on the outside, and white within, as they, and
neare of the same taste, but not altogether so pleasant.

The Potatos of Canada, (which hath diuers names giuen it by diuers
men, as Pelleterius of Middleborough in his _Plantarum Synonimia_,
calleth it _Heliotropium Indicum tuberosum_, Fabius Columna in the
second part of his _Phytobasanos_, _Flos Solis Farnesianus_, _siue
Aster Peruanus tuberosus_: We in England, from some ignorant and idle
head, haue called them Artichokes of Ierusalem, only because the roote,
being boyled, is in taste like the bottome of an Artichoke head: but
they may most fitly be called, Potatos of Canada, because their rootes
are in forme, colour and taste, like vnto the Potatos of Virginia,
but greater, and the French brought them first from Canada into these
parts) riseth vp with diuers stiffe, round stalkes, eight or tenne
foote high in our Country, where they haue scarce shewed their flowers,
whereas the very head of flowers in other Countries, as Fabius Columna
expresseth it, being of a Pyramis or Sugar loafe fashion, broade
spreading below, and smaller pointed vpwards towards the toppe, is
neere of the same length, whereon are set large and broade rough greene
leaues, very like vnto the leaues of the flower of the Sunne, but
smaller, yet growing in the very same manner, round about the stalkes:
at the very later end of Summer, or the beginning of Autumne, if the
roote bee well planted and defended, it will giue a shew of a few
small yellow flowers at the top, like vnto the flowers of _Aster_ or
Starre-worte, and much smaller then any flower of the Sunne, which come
to no perfection with vs: the roote, while the plant is growing aboue
ground, encreaseth not to his full growth, but when the Summer is well
spent, and the springing of the stalk is past, which is about the end
of August, or in September, then the root is perceiued to be encreased
in the earth, and will before Autumne be spent, that is, in October,
swell like a mound or hillocke, round about the foote of the stalkes,
and will not haue his rootes fit to be taken vp, vntill the stalkes be
halfe withered at the soonest; but after they be withered, and so all
the winter long vntill the Spring againe, they are good, and fit to bee
taken vp and vsed, which are a number of tuberous round rootes, growing
close together; so that it hath beene obserued, that from one roote,
being set in the Spring, there hath been forty or more taken vp againe,
and to haue ouer-filled a pecke measure, and are of a pleasant good
taste as many haue tryed.

        The Vse of all these Potato’s.

        The Spanish Potato’s are roasted vnder the embers, and being
        pared or peeled and sliced, are put into sacke with a little
        sugar, or without, and is delicate to be eaten.

        They are vsed to be baked with Marrow, Sugar, Spice, and other
        things in Pyes, which are a daintie and costly dish for the
        table.

        The Comfit-makers preserue them, and candy them as diuers other
        things, and so ordered, is very delicate, fit to accompany such
        other banquetting dishes.

        The Virginia Potato’s being dressed after all these waies
        before specified, maketh almost as delicate meate as the former.

        The Potato’s of Canada are by reason of their great increasing,
        growne to be so common here with vs at London, that euen the
        most vulgar begin to despise them, whereas when they were first
        receiued among vs, they were dainties for a Queene.

        Being put into seething water they are soone boyled tender,
        which after they bee peeled, sliced and stewed with butter,
        and a little wine, was a dish for a Queene, beeing as pleasant
        as the bottome of an Artichoke: but the too frequent vse,
        especially being so plentifull and cheape, hath rather bred a
        loathing then a liking of them.




CHAP. L.

_Cinara._   Artichokes.


The fruits that grow vpon or neere the ground, are next to be entreated
of, and first of Artichokes, whereof there be diuers kindes, some
accounted tame and of the Garden, others wilde and of late planted in
Gardens, Orchards or Fieldes, of purpose to be meate for men.

The Artichoke hath diuers great, large, and long hollowed leaues, much
cut in or torne on both edges, without any great shew of prickles on
them, of a kinde of whitish greene, like vnto an ash colour, whereof it
tooke the Latin name _Cinara_: the stalke is strong, thicke and round,
with some skins as it were downe all the length of them, bearing at the
toppe one scaly head, made at the first like a Pine-apple, but after
growing greater, the scales are more separate, yet in the best kindes
lying close, and not flaring, as some other kindes doe, which are
eyther of a reddish browne, whitish, or greenish colour, and in some
broade at the ends, in others sharpe or prickly: after the head hath
stoode a great while, if it bee suffered, and the Summer proue hot and
kindly, in some there will breake forth at the toppe thereof, a tuft of
blewish purple thrumes or threds, vnder which grow the seede, wrapped
in a great deale of dounie substance: but that roote that yeeldeth
flowers will hardly abide the next winter; but else being cut off when
it is well growne, that dounie matter abideth close in the middle of
the head, hauing the bottome thereof flat and round, which is that
matter or substance that is vsed to be eaten: the roote spreadeth it
selfe in the ground reasonable well, yeelding diuers heads of leaues
or suckers, whereby it is increased.

[Illustration:

   1 _Cinara satiua rubra._ The red Artichoke.
   2 _Cinara satiua alba._ The white Artichoke.
   3 _Cinara patula._ The French Artichoke.
   4 _Cinara siluestris._ The Thistle Artichoke.
   5 _Carduus esculentus._ The Chardon.
]

The white Artichoke is in all things like the red, but that the head
is of a whitish ashe colour, like the leaues, whereas the former is
reddish.

We haue also another, whose head is greene, and very sharpe vpwards,
and is common in many places.

Wee haue had also another kinde in former times that grew as high as
any man, and branched into diuers stalkes, euery one bearing a head
thereon, almost as bigge as the first.

There is another kinde, called the Muske Artichoke, which groweth like
the French kinde, but is much better in spending, although it haue a
lesser bottome.

The French Artichoke hath a white head, the scales whereof stand
staring far asunder one from another at the ends, which are sharpe:
this is well known by this qualitie, that while it is hot after it is
boyled, it smelleth so strong, that one would verily thinke it had bin
boyled in stinking water, which was brought ouer after a great froste
that had well nigh consumed our best kindes, and are now almost cleane
cast out again, none being willing to haue it take vp the roome of
better.

There is a lowe kinde that groweth much about Paris, which the French
esteeme more then any other, and is lower then the former French kinde,
the head whereof as well as the leaues, is of a fresher greene colour,
almost yellowish.

Then there is the Thistle Artichoke, which is almost a wilde kinde,
and groweth smaller, with a more open and prickly head then any of the
former.

And lastly, the Chardon as they call it, because it is almost of the
forme and nature of a Thistle, or wilde Artichoke. This groweth high,
and full of sharpe prickles, of a grayish colour. Iohn Tradescante
assured mee, hee saw three acres of Land about Brussels planted with
this kinde, which the owner whited like Endiue, and then sold them in
the winter: Wee cannot yet finde the true manner of dressing them, that
our Countrey may take delight therein.

All these kindes are encreased by slipping the young shootes from the
root, which being replanted in February, March, or Aprill, haue the
same yeare many times, but the next at the most, borne good heads.

Wee finde by dayly experience, that our English red Artichoke is in our
Countrey the most delicate meate of any of the other, and therefore
diuers thinking it to bee a seuerall kinde, haue sent them into Italie,
France, and the Lowe Countries, where they haue not abode in their
goodnesse aboue two yeare, but that they haue degenerated; so that it
seemeth, that our soyle and climate hath the preheminence to nourish vp
this plant to his highest excellencie.


        The Vse of Artichokes.

        The manner of preparing them for the Table is well knowne to
        the youngest Housewife I thinke, to bee boyled in faire water,
        and a little salt, vntill they bee tender, and afterwardes a
        little vinegar and pepper, put to the butter, poured vpon them
        for the sawce, and so are serued to the Table.

        They vse likewise to take the boyled bottomes to make Pyes,
        which is a delicate kinde of baked meate.

        The Chardon is eaten rawe of diuers, with vinegar and oyle,
        pepper and salt, all of them, or some, as euery one liketh for
        their delight.




CHAP. LI.

_Fabæ & Phaseoli._   Garden and French Beanes.


The Garden Beane is of two colours, red or blacke, and white, yet both
rise from one; the small or fielde Beanes I make no mention of in this
place; but the French or Kidney Beane is almost of infinite sorts and
colours: we doe not for all that intend to trouble you in this place,
with the knowledge or relation of any more then is fit for a Garden of
that nature, that I haue propounded it in the beginning.

Our ordinary Beanes, seruing for foode for the poorer sort for the
most part, are planted as well in fieldes as in gardens, because the
quantity of them that are spent taketh vp many acres of land to be
planted in, and rise vp with one, two or three stalks, according to
the fertilitie of the soyle, being smooth and square, higher then
any man oftentimes, whereon are set at certaine distances, from the
very bottome almost to the toppe, two long smooth fleshy and thicke
leaues almost round, one standing by another at the end of a small
footestalke: betweene these leaues and the stalke, come forth diuers
flowers, all of them looking one way for the most part, which are
close a little turned vp at the brimmes, white and spotted with a
blackish spot in the middle of them, and somewhat purplish at the foot
or bottome, of the forme almost of Broome or Pease flowers, many of
which that grow vpward toward the toppe, doe seldome beare fruit, and
therefore are gathered to distill, and the toppes of the stalkes cut
off, to cause the rest to thriue the better; after which grow vp long
great smooth greene pods, greater then in any other kinde of Pulse,
which grow blacke when they are ripe, and containe within them two,
three or foure Beanes, which are somewhat flat and round, eyther white
or reddish, which being full ripe grow blackish: the roote hath diuers
fibres annexed vnto the maine roote, which dyeth euery yeare.

The French or Kidney Beane riseth vp at the first but with one stalke,
which afterwards diuideth it selfe into many armes or branches, euery
one of them being so weak, that without they be sustained with stickes
or poles, whereon with their winding and claspers they take hold, they
would lye fruitlesse vpon the ground: vpon these branches grow forth
at seuerall places long footestalkes, with euery of them three broade,
round and pointed greene leaues at the end of them, towards the tops
whereof come forth diuers flowers, made like vnto Pease blossomes, of
the same colour for the most part that the fruit will be of, that is to
say, eyther white, or yellow, or red, or blackish, or of a deepe purple
&c. but white is most vsuall for our Garden; after which come long and
slender flat pods, some crooked, and some straight, with a string as it
were running downe the backe thereof, wherein are contained flattish
round fruit, made to the fashion of a kidney: the roote is long, and
spreadeth with many fibres annexed vnto it, perishing euery yeare.


        The Vse of these Beanes.

        The Garden Beanes serue (as I said before) more for the vse of
        the poore then of the rich: I shall therefore only shew you
        the order the poore take with them, and leaue curiosity to
        them that will bestow time vpon them. They are only boyled in
        faire water and a little salt, and afterwards stewed with some
        butter, a little vinegar and pepper being put vnto them, and so
        eaten: or else eaten alone after they are boyled without any
        other sawce. The water of the blossomes distilled, is vsed to
        take away spots, and to cleer the skin. The water of the greene
        huskes or cods is good for the stone.

        The Kidney Beanes boyled in water huske and all, onely the ends
        cut off, and the string taken away, and stewed with butter &c.
        are esteemed more sauory meate to many mens pallates, then the
        former, and are a dish more oftentimes at rich mens Tables then
        at the poore.




CHAP. LII.

_Pisum._   Pease.


There is a very great variety of manured Pease known to vs, and I
think more in our Country then in others, whereof some prosper better
in one ground and country, and some in others: I shall giue you the
description of one alone for all the rest, and recite vnto you the
names of the rest.

Garden Pease are for the most part the greatest and sweetest kinds,
and are sustained with stakes or bushes. The Field Pease are not so
vsed, but growe without any such adoe. They spring vp with long,
weake, hollow, and brittle (while they are young and greene) whitish
greene stalkes, branched into diuers parts, and at euery ioynt where
it parteth one broad round leafe compassing the stalke about, so that
it commeth as it were thorough it: the leaues are winged, made of
diuers small leaues set to a middle ribbe, of a whitish greene colour,
with claspers at the ends of the leaues, whereby it taketh hold of
whatsoeuer standeth next vnto it: betweene the leaues and the stalkes
come forth the flowers, standing two or three together, euery one by it
selfe on his owne seuerall stalke, which are either wholly white, or
purple, or mixed white and purple, or purple and blew: the fruit are
long, and somewhat round cods, whereof some are greater, others lesser,
some thicke and short, some plaine and smooth, others a little crooked
at the ends; wherein also are contained diuers formes of fruit or
pease; some being round, others cornered, some small, some great, some
white, others gray, and some spotted: the roote is small, and quickly
perisheth.


        The kindes of Pease are these:

        The Rounciuall.

        The greene Hasting.

        The Sugar Pease.

        The spotted Pease.

        The gray Pease.

        The white Hasting.

        The Pease without skins.

        The Scottish or tufted Pease, which some call the Rose Pease,
        is a good white Pease fit to be eaten.

        The early or French Pease, which some call Fulham Pease,
        because those grounds thereabouts doe bring them soonest
        forward for any quantity, although sometimes they miscarry by
        their haste and earlinesse.


_Cicer Arietinum._   Rams Ciches.

This is a kinde of Pulse, so much vsed in Spaine, that it is vsually
one of their daintie dishes at all their feasts: They are of two
sorts, white and red; the white is onely vsed for meate, the other for
medicine. It beareth many vpright branches with winged leaues, many
set together, being small, almost round, and dented about the edges:
the flowers are either white or purple, according to the colour of the
Pease which follow, and are somewhat round at the head, but cornered
and pointed at the end, one or two at the most in a small roundish cod.

        The Vse of Pease.

        Pease of all or the most of these sorts, are either vsed when
        they are greene, and be a dish of meate for the table of the
        rich as well as the poore, yet euery one obseruing his time,
        and the kinde: the fairest, sweetest, youngest, and earliest
        for the better sort, the later and meaner kindes for the
        meaner, who doe not giue the deerest price: Or

        Being dry, they serue to boyle into a kinde of broth or
        pottage, wherein many doe put Tyme, Mints, Sauory, or some
        other such hot herbes, to giue it the better rellish, and is
        much vsed in Towne and Countrey in the Lent time, especially
        of the poorer sort of people.

        It is much vsed likewise at Sea for them that goe long voyages,
        and is for change, because it is fresh, a welcome diet to most
        persons therein.

        The Rams Ciches the Spaniards call _Grauancos_, and
        _Garauancillos_, and eate them boyled and stewed as the most,
        dainty kinde of Pease that are, they are of a very good
        rellish, and doe nourish much; but yet are not without that
        windy quality that all sorts of Pulse are subiect vnto: they
        increase bodily lust much more then any other sorts, and as it
        is thought, doth helpe to encrease seede.




CHAP. LIII.

_Cucumer._   The Cowcumber.


Of Cowcumbers there are diuers sorts, differing chiefly in the forme
and colour of the fruit, and not in the forme of the plant; therefore
one description shall serue in stead of all the rest.

The Cowcumber bringeth forth many trailing rough greene branches
lying on the ground, all along whereof growe seuerall leaues, which
are rough, broad, vneuen at the edges, and pointed at the ends, with
long crooked tendrils comming forth at the same ioynt with the leafe,
but on the other side thereof: between the stalks & the leaues at the
ioynts come forth the flowers seuerally, euery one standing on a short
foot-stalke, opening it selfe into fiue leaues, of a yellowish colour,
at the bottome whereof groweth the fruit, long and greene at the first,
but when it is thorough ripe, a little yellowish, hauing many furrowes,
and vneuen bunches all the length of it, wherein is a white firme
substance next vnto the skin, and a cleare pulpe or watery substance,
with white flat seede lying dispersed through it: the roote is long and
white, with diuers fibres at it.


        The kindes.

        The first described is called, The long greene Cowcumber.

        There is another is called, The short Cowcumber, being short,
        and of an equall bignesse in the body thereof, and of an
        vnequall bignesse at both ends.

        The long Yellow, which is yellowish from the beginning, and
        more yellow when it is ripe, and hath beene measured to
        be thirteene inches long: but this is not that small long
        Cowcumber, called of the Latines, _Cucumis anguinus_.

        Another kinde is early ripe, called The French kinde.

        The Dantsicke kinde beareth but small fruit, growing on short
        branches or runners: the pickled Cowcumbers that are vsually
        sold are of this kind.

        The Muscouie kinde is the smallest of all other, yet knowne,
        and beareth not aboue foure or fiue at the most on a roote,
        which are no bigger then small Lemons.


        The Vse of Cowcumbers.

        Some vse to cast a little salt on their sliced Cowcumbers, and
        let them stand halfe an houre or more in a dish, and then poure
        away the water that commeth from them by the salt, and after
        put vinegar, oyle, &c. thereon, as euery one liketh: this is
        done, to take away the ouermuch waterishnesse and coldnesse of
        the Cowcumbers.

        In many countries they vse to eate Cowcumbers as wee doe Apples
        or Peares, paring and giuing slices of them, as we would to our
        friends of some dainty Apple or Peare.

        The pickled Cowcumbers that come from beyond Sea, are much
        vsed with vs for sawce to meate all the Winter long. Some
        haue striuen to equall them, by pickling vp our Cowcumbers at
        the later end of the yeare, when they are cheapest, taking the
        little ones and scalding them thoroughly well, which after they
        put in brine, with some Dill or Fenell leaues and stalkes: but
        these are nothing comparable to the former, wee either missing
        of the right and orderly pickling of them, or the kinde it
        selfe differing much from ours (as I said of the Dantsicke
        kinde) for ours are neither so tender and firme, nor so sauoury
        as the other.

        The rawe or greene Cowcumbers are fittest for the hotter time
        of the yeare, and for hot stomackes, and not to be vsed in
        colder weather or cold stomackes, by reason of the coldnesse,
        whereby many haue been ouertaken.

        The seede is vsed physically in many medicines that serue to
        coole, and a little to make the passages of vrine slippery, and
        to giue ease to hot diseases.




CHAP. LIIII.

_Melo._   Milions or Muske Melons.


There bee diuers sorts of Melons found out at this day, differing much
in the goodnesse of taste one from another. This Countrey hath not had
vntill of late yeares the skill to nourse them vp kindly, but now there
are many that are so well experienced therein, and haue their ground so
well prepared, as that they will not misse any yeare, if it be not too
extreme vnkindly, to haue many ripe ones in a reasonable time: yet some
will be later then others alwayes.

The Melon is certainly a kinde of Cowcumber, it doth so neere resemble
it, both in the manner of his growing, hauing rough trailing branches,
rough vneuen leaues, and yellow flowers: after which come the fruit,
which is rounder, thicker, bigger, more rugged, and spotted on the
outside then the Cowcumber, of a russet colour, and greene vnderneath,
which when it groweth full ripe, will change a little yellowish, being
as deepe furrowed and ribbed as they, and besides hauing chaps or rifts
in diuers places of the rinde: the inward hard substance is yellow,
which onely is eaten: the seede which is bigger, and a little yellower
then the Cowcumber, lying in the middle onely among the moister pulpe:
the smell and changing of his colour, fore-shew their ripenesse to them
that are experienced: the roote is long, with many fibres at it. The
fruit requireth much watering in the hot time of the day, to cause them
to ripen the sooner, as I haue obserued by diuers of the best skill
therein.


        The Vse of the kindes of Melons.

        The best Melon seede doe come to vs out of Spaine, some haue
        come out of Turkie, but they haue been nothing so good and
        kindly.

        Some are called Sugar Melons, others Peare Melons, and others
        Muske Melons.

        They haue beene formerly only eaten by great personages,
        because the fruit was not only delicate but rare; and therefore
        diuers were brought from France, and since were noursed vp by
        the Kings or Noblemens Gardiners onely, to serue for their
        Masters delight: but now diuers others that haue skill and
        conueniencie of ground for them, doe plant them and make them
        more common.

        They paire away the outer rinde, and cut out the inward pulpe
        where the seede lyeth, slice the yellow firme inward rinde or
        substance, & so eate it with salt and pepper (and good store of
        wine, or else it will hardly digest) for this is firmer, & hath
        not that moisture in it that the Cowcumbers haue. It is also
        more delicate, and of more worth, which recompenseth the paine.

        The seed of these Melons are vsed as Cowcumbers physically, and
        together with them most vsually.




CHAP. LV.

_Pepo._   Pompions.


We haue but one kinde of Pompion (as I take it) in all our Gardens,
notwithstanding the diuersities of bignesse and colour.

The Pompion or great Melon (or as some call it Milion) creepeth vpon
the ground (if nothing bee by it whereon it may take hold and climbe)
with very great, ribbed, rough, and prickly branches, whereon are set
very large rough leaues, cut in on the edges with deepe gashes, and
dented besides, with many claspers also, which winde about euery thing
they meete withall: the flowers are great and large, hollow and yellow,
diuided at the brims into fiue parts, at the bottome of which, as it
is in the rest, groweth the fruit, which is very great, sometimes of
the bignesse of a mans body, and oftentimes lesse, in some ribbed or
bunched, in others plaine, and either long or round, either greene or
yellow, or gray, as Nature listeth to shew her selfe; for it is but
waste time, to recite all the formes and colours may be obserued in
them: the inner rinde next vnto the outer is yellowish and firme: the
seede is great, flat, and white, lying in the middle of the watery
pulpe: the roote is of the bignesse of a mans thumbe or greater,
dispersed vnder ground with many small fibres ioyned thereunto.

Gourds are kindes of Melons; but because wee haue no vse of them, wee
leaue them vnto their fit place.


        The Vse of Pompions.

        They are boyled in faire water and salt, or in powdered beefe
        broth, or sometimes in milke, and so eaten, or else buttered;
        They vse likewise to take out the inner watery substance with
        the seedes, and fill vp the place with Pippins, and hauing laid
        on the couer which they cut off from the toppe, to take out the
        pulpe, they bake them together, and the poore of the Citie, as
        well as the Country people, doe eate thereof, as of a dainty
        dish.

        The seede hereof, as well as of Cowcumbers and Melons, are
        cooling, and serue for emulsions in the like manner for Almond
        milkes, &c. for those are troubled with the stone.

]


There be diuers sorts of Strawberries, whereof those that are noursed
vp in Gardens or Orchards I intend to giue you the knowledge in this
place, and leaue the other to a fitter; yet I must needs shew you of
one of the wilde sorts, which for his strangenesse is worthy of this
Garden: And I must also enforme you, that the wilde Strawberry that
groweth in the Woods is our Garden Strawberry, but bettered by the
soyle and transplanting.

The Strawberry hath his leaues closed together at the first springing
vp, which afterwards spread themselues into three diuided parts or
leaues, euery one standing vpon a small long foote-stalke, greene on
the vpperside, grayish vnderneath, and snipped or dented about the
edges; among which rise vp diuers small stalkes, bearing foure or fiue
flowers at the tops, consisting of fiue white round pointed leaues,
somewhat yellowish in the bottome, with some yellow threads therein;
after which come the fruit, made of many small graines set together,
like vnto a small Mulberry or Raspis, reddish when it is ripe, and of a
pleasant winy taste, wherein is enclosed diuers small blackish seede;
the roote is reddish and long, with diuers small threads at it, and
sendeth forth from the head thereof long reddish strings running vpon
the ground, which shoot forth leaues in many places, whereby it is much
encreased.

The white Strawberry differeth not from the red, but in the colour of
the fruite, which is whiter then the former when it is thorough ripe,
enclining to rednesse.

The greene Strawberry likewise differeth not, but that the fruit is
green on all sides when it is ripe, saue on that side the Sun lyeth
vpon it, and there it is somewhat red.

The Virginia Strawberry carryeth the greatest leafe of any other,
except the Bohemian, but scarce can one Strawberry be seene ripe among
a number of plants; I thinke the reason thereof to be the want of
skill, or industry to order it aright. For the Bohemia, and all other
Strawberries will not beare kindly, if you suffer them to grow with
many strings, and therefore they are still cut away.

There is another very like vnto this, that Iohn Tradescante brought
with him from Brussels long agoe, and in seuen yeares could neuer see
one berry ripe on all sides, but still the better part rotten, although
it would euery yeare flower abundantly, and beare very large leaues.

The Bohemia Strawberry hath beene with vs but of late dayes, but is
the goodliest and greatest, both for leafe next to the Virginian, and
for beauty farre surpassing all; for some of the berries haue beene
measured to bee neere fiue inches about. Master Quester the Postmaster
first brought them ouer into our Country, as I vnderstand, but I know
no man so industrious in the carefull planting and bringing them to
perfection in that plentifull maner, as Master Vincent Sion who dwelt
on the Banck side, neer the old Paris garden staires, who from seuen
rootes, as hee affirmed to me, in one yeare and a halfe, planted halfe
an acree of ground with the increase from them, besides those he gaue
away to his friends, and with him I haue seene such, and of that
bignesse before mentioned.

One Strawberry more I promised to shew you, which although it be
a wilde kinde, and of no vse for meate, yet I would not let this
discourse passe, without giuing you the knowledge of it. It is in
leafe much like vnto the ordinary, but differeth in that the flower,
if it haue any, is greene, or rather it beareth a small head of greene
leaues, many set thicke together like vnto a double ruffe, in the
midst whereof standeth the fruit, which when it is ripe, sheweth to
be soft and somewhat reddish, like vnto a Strawberry, but with many
small harmlesse prickles on them, which may be eaten and chewed in the
mouth without any maner of offence, and is somewhat pleasant like a
Strawberry: it is no great bearer, but those it doth beare, are set at
the toppes of the stalks close together, pleasant to behold, and fit
for a Gentlewoman to weare on her arme, &c. as a raritie instead of a
flower.


        The Vse of Strawberries.

        The leaues of Strawberries are alwaies vsed among other herbes
        in cooling drinkes, as also in lotions, and gargles for the
        mouth and throate: the rootes are sometimes added to make it
        the more effectuall, and withall somwhat the more binding.

        The berries themselues are often brought to the Table as a
        reare seruice, whereunto claret wine, creame or milke is added
        with sugar, as euery one liketh; as also at other times, both
        with the better and meaner sort, and are a good cooling and
        pleasant dish in the hot Summer season.

        The water distilled of the berries, is good for the passions
        of the heart, caused by the perturbation of the spirits, being
        eyther drunke alone, or in wine; and maketh the heart merry.

        Some doe hold that the water helpeth to clense the face from
        spots, and to adde some cleerenesse to the skinne.




CHAP. LVII.

_Angelica._   Garden Angelica.


Hauing thus furnished you out a Kitchen Garden with all sorts of
herbes, roots & fruits fit for it, and for any mans priuate vse, as I
did at the first appropriate it; let me a little transcend, and for the
profit & vse of Country Gentlewomen and others, furnish them with some
few other herbes, of the most especiall vse for those shall need them,
to be planted at hand in their Gardens, to spend as occasion shall
serue, and first of Angelica.

Angelica hath great and long winged leaues, made of many broade greene
ones, diuided one from another vpon the stalk, which is three foot
long or better somtimes, among which rise vp great thicke and hollow
stalkes with some few ioynts, whereat doth alwayes stand two long
leaues compassing the stalke at the bottome, in some places at the
ioynts spring out other stalkes or branches, bearing such like leaues
but smaller, and at the tops very large vmbels of white flowers, that
turne into whitish seede somewhat thicke: the roote groweth great with
many branches at it, but quickly perisheth after it hath borne seede:
to preserue the roote therefore the better, they vse to cut it often in
the yeare, thereby to hinder the running vp to seede: the whole plant,
both leafe, roote and seede, is of an excellent comfortable sent,
sauour and taste.


        The Vse of Angelica.

        The distilled water of Angelica, eyther simple or compound, is
        of especiall vse _in deliquium animi, vel cordis tremores &
        passiones_, that is, swounings, when the spirits are ouercome
        and faint, or tremblings and passions of the heart, to expell
        any windy or noysome vapours from it. The green stalkes or the
        young rootes being preserued or candied, are very effectuall to
        comfort and warme a colde and weake stomacke: and in the time
        of infection is of excellent good vse to preserue the spirits
        and heart from infection. The dryed roote made into pouder,
        and taken in wine or other drinke, will abate the rage of lust
        in young persons, as I haue it related vnto me vpon credit:
        A Syrupe made thereof in this manner, is very profitable to
        expectorate flegme out of the chest and lunges, and to procure
        a sweete breath. Into the greene stalke of Angelica as it
        standeth growing, make a great gashe or incision, wherein put a
        quantitie of fine white Sugar, letting it there abide for three
        dayes, and after take it forth by cutting a hole at the next
        ioynt vnder the cut, where the Syrupe resteth, or cut off the
        stalke, and turne it downe, that the Syrrupe may drayne forth;
        which keepe for a most delicate medicine.




CHAP. LVIII.

_Dracunculus hortensis siue Serpentaria._   Dragons.


Dragons riseth out of the ground with a bare or naked round whitish
stalke, spotted very much with purplish spots and strakes, bearing at
the toppe therof a few greene leaues very much diuided on all sides,
standing vpon long foote-stalkes, in the middle whereof (if the roote
be old enough) commeth forth a great long huske or hose, green on the
outside, and of a darke purplish colour on the inside, with a slender
long reddish pestell or clapper in the middle: the roote is great,
round, flat and whitish on the outside, and whiter within, very like
vnto the rootes of _Arum_, or Wakerobin, and tasting somewhat sharpe
like it.


        The Vse of Dragons.

        The chiefe vse whereunto Dragons are applyed, is, that
        according to an old receiued custome and tradition (and not the
        iudgement of any learned Author) the distilled water is giuen
        with Mithridatum or Treakle to expell noysome and pestilentiall
        vapours from the heart.




CHAP. LIX.

_Ruta._   Garden Rue, or Herbe Grace.


Garden Rue or Herbe Grace groweth vp with hard whitish wooddy stalkes,
whereon are set diuers branches of leaues, being diuided into many
small ones, which are somewhat thicke and round pointed, of a blewish
greene colour: the flowers stand at the tops of the stalkes consisting
of foure small yellow leaues, with a greene button in the middle, and
diuers small yellow threds about it, which growing ripe, containe
within them small blacke seede: the roote is white and wooddy,
spreading farre in the ground.


        The Vse of Rue.

        The many good properties whereunto Rue serueth, hath I thinke
        in former times caused the English name of Herbe Grace to be
        giuen vnto it. For without doubt it is a most wholesome herbe,
        although bitter and strong, and could our dainty stomackes
        brooke the vse thereof, it would worke admirable effects being
        carefully and skilfully applyed, as time and occasion did
        require: but not vndiscreetly or hand ouer head, as many vse to
        doe that haue no skill. Some doe rippe vp a beade rowle of the
        vertues of Rue, as Macer the Poet and others, in whom you shall
        finde them set downe, to bee good for the head, eyes, breast,
        liuer, heart, spleene, &c. In some places they vse to boyle the
        leaues of Rue, and keep them in pickle, to eate them as Sampire
        for the helpe of weake eyes. It is very auaileable in glisters
        or drinkes against the winde or the collicke, and to procure
        vrine that is stayed by the paines therof. The distilled water
        is often vsed for the same purposes aforesaid: but beware of
        the too frequent or ouermuch vse thereof, because it heateth
        exceedingly, and wasteth nature mightily.




CHAP. LX.

_Carduus Benedictus._   The Blessed Thistle.


Carduus benedictus or the blessed Thistle, hath many weake tender
branches lying for the most part on the ground, whereon are set long
and narrow leaues, much cut in or waued about the edges, hairy or rough
in handling, yet without any hard or sharpe thornes or prickles at all,
that the tenderest hand may touch them without harme: but those that
grow toward the toppes of the stalkes are somewhat more prickly, and
the heads which grow on the tops of the seuerall branches are somewhat
sharpe, set with prickles like a Thistle: the flower is yellow, and
the seede lying within the woolly or flocky doune like to all other
thistles, are blackish, long and round, with a few haires on the head
of them: the roote is white, and perisheth euery yeare after it hath
giuen seede.


        The Vse of the blessed Thistle.

        The distilled water hereof is much vsed to be drunke against
        agues of all sortes, eyther pestilentiall or humorall, of long
        continuance or of lesse: but the deception of the herbe giuen
        in due time, hath the more forcible operation: it helpeth to
        expell wormes, because of the bitternesse, and is thereby also
        a friend to the stomack ouercharged with chollar, and to clense
        the liuer: it prouoketh sweate and vrine, is helpefull to them
        are troubled with the stone, and to ease paines in the sides.

_Solarium vesicarium, siue Alkakengi._   Winter Cherries.


The Winter Cherry hath a running or creeping roote in the ground,
of the bignesse many times of ones little finger, shooting forth at
seuerall ioynts in seuerall places, whereby it quickly spreadeth a
great compasse of ground: the stalke riseth not aboue a yard high,
whereon are set many broade and long greene leaues, somewhat like vnto
the leaues of Nightshade, but larger: at the ioynts whereof come forth
whitish flowers made of fiue leaues a peece, which after turne into
green berries, inclosed with thin skins or bladders, which change to
bee reddish when they grow ripe, the berry likewise being reddish, and
as large as a Cherry, wherein are contained many flat and yellowish
seed lying within the pulpe: which being gathered and strung vp, are
kept all the yeare to be vsed vpon occasion.


        The Vse of Winter Cherries.

        The distilled water of the herbe and fruit together, is
        often taken of them that are troubled with the sharpnesse or
        difficultie of vrine, and with the stone in the kidneyes, or
        grauel in the bladder: but the berries themselues either greene
        or dryed boyled eyther in broth, in wine, or in water, is much
        more effectuall: It is likewise conducing to open obstructions
        of the liuer, &c. and thereby to helpe the yellow Iaundise.

_Asarum._   Asarabacca.


Asarabacca, from a small creeping roote set with many fibres, shooteth
forth diuers heads, and from euery of them sundry leaues, euery one
standing vpon a long greene stalke, which are round, thicke, and of a
very sad or darke greene colour, and shining withall: from the rootes
likewise spring vp short stalkes, not fully foure fingers high, at the
toppe of euery one of which standeth the flower, in fashion very like
the seede vessell of Henbane seede, of a greenish purple colour, which
changeth not his forme, but groweth in time to containe therein small
cornered seed: the greene leaues abide all the winter many times, but
vsually sheddeth them in winter, and recouereth fresh in the spring.


        The Vse of Asarabacca.

        The leaues are much and often vsed to procure vomits, fiue or
        seuen of them bruised, and the iuice of them drunke in ale or
        wine. An extract made of the leaues with wine artificially
        performed, might bee kept all the yeare thorough, to bee vsed
        vpon any present occasion, the quantitie to bee proportioned
        according to the constitution of the patient. The roote worketh
        not so strongly by vomit, as the leaues, yet is often vsed for
        the same purpose, and besides is held auaileable to prouoke
        vrine, to open obstructions in the liuer and spleene, and is
        put among diuers other simples, both into Mithridatum and
        Andromachus Treakle, which is vsually called Venice Treakle. A
        dram of the dryed roots in pouder giuen in white wine a little
        before the fit of an ague, taketh away the shaking fit, &
        therby cause the hot fit to be the more remisse, and in twice
        taking expell it quite.




CHAP. LXIII.

_Glycyrrhiza siue Liqueritia._   Licorice.


Although there are two sorts of Licorice set downe by diuers Authors,
yet because this Land familiarly is acquainted but with one sort, I
shall not neede for this Garden, to make any further relation of that
is vnknowne, but onely of that sort which is sufficiently frequent with
vs. It riseth vp with diuers wooddy stalks, whereon are set at seuerall
distances many winged leaues, that is to say, many narrow long greene
leaues set together on both sides of the stalke, and an odde one at the
end, very well resembling a young Ashe tree sprung vp from the seede:
this by many yeares continuance in a place without remouing, and not
else, will bring forth flowers many standing together spike-fashion one
aboue another vpon the stalkes, of the forme of Pease blossomes, but
of a very pale or bleake blew colour, which turne into long somewhat
flat and smooth cods, wherein is contained small round harde seede: the
roote runneth downe exceeding deep into the ground, with diuers other
smaller roots and fibres growing with them, and shoote out suckers from
the maine rootes all about, whereby it is much encreased, of a brownish
colour on the outside, and yellow within, of a farre more weake sweete
taste, yet far more pleasing to vs then that Licorice that is brought
vs from beyond Sea; because that, being of a stronger sweet taste hath
a bitternesse ioyned with it, which maketh it the lesse pleasing and
acceptable to most.


        The Vse of Licorice.

        Our English Licorice is now adaies of more familiar vse (as I
        said before) then the outlandish, and is wholly spent and vsed
        to helpe to digest and expectorate flegme out of the chest and
        lunges, and doth allay the sharpenesse or saltnesse thereof.
        It is good also for those are troubled with shortnesse of
        breath, and for all sorts of coughes. The iuice of Licorice
        artificially made with Hyssope water, serueth very well for all
        the purposes aforesaid. It being dissolued with Gum Tragacanth
        in Rose water, is an excellent Lohoc or licking medicine to
        breake flegme, and to expectorate it, as also to avoyde thin
        frothy matter, or thin salt flegme, which often fretteth the
        lungs. It doth also lenisie exulcerated kidneyes, or the
        bladder, and helpeth to heale them. It is held also good for
        those that cannot make their water but by drops, or a small
        deale at a time.

        The dryed root finely minced, is a speciall ingredient into all
        Trageas or Dredges, seruing for the purposes aforesaid, but the
        vse of them is almost wholly left now adaies with all sorts.

Thus haue I shewed you not only the herbes, rootes and fruites, noursed
vp in this Garden, but such herbes as are of most necessary vses for
the Country Gentlewomens houses: And now I will shew you the Orchard
also.




THE ORDERING OF THE ORCHARD.

The third part, or ORCHARD.




CHAP. I.

_The situation of an Orchard for fruit-bearing trees, and how to amend
the defects of many grounds._


As I haue done in the two former parts of this Treatise, so I meane to
proceede in this; first to set downe the situation of an Orchard, and
then other things in order: And first, I hold that an Orchard which is,
or should bee of some reasonable large extent, should be so placed,
that the house should haue the Garden of flowers iust before it open
vpon the South, and the Kitchen Garden on the one side thereof, should
also haue the Orchard on the other side of the Garden of Pleasure, for
many good reasons: First, for that the fruit trees being grown great
and tall, will be a great shelter from the North and East windes,
which may offend your chiefest Garden, and although that your Orchard
stand a little bleake vpon the windes, yet trees rather endure these
strong bitter blasts, then other smaller and more tender shrubs and
herbes can doe. Secondly, if your Orchard should stand behinde your
Garden of flowers more Southward, it would shadow too much of the
Garden, and besides, would so binde in the North and East, and North
and West windes vpon the Garden, that it would spoile many tender
things therein, and so much abate the edge of your pleasure thereof,
that you would willingly wish to haue no Orchard, rather then that
it should so much annoy you by the so ill standing thereof. Thirdly,
the falling leaues being still blowne with the winde so aboundantly
into the garden, would either spoile many things, or haue one daily
and continuall attending thereon, to cleanse and sweepe them away.
Or else to auoide these great inconueniences, appoint out an Orchard
the farther off, and set a greater distance of ground betweene. For
the ground or soile of the Orchard, what I haue spoken concerning the
former Garden for the bettering of the seuerall grounds, may very well
serue and be applyed to this purpose. But obserue this, that, whereas
your Gardens before spoken of may be turned vp, manured, and bettered
with soile if they growe out of heart, your Orchard is not so easily
done, but must abide many yeares without altering; and therefore if the
ground be barren, or not good, it had the more neede to bee amended,
or wholly made good, before you make an Orchard of it; yet some there
be that doe appoint, that where euery tree should bee set, you onely
digge that place to make it good: but you must know, that the rootes
of trees runne further after a little times standing, then the first
compasse they are set in; and therefore a little compasse of ground
can maintaine them but a little while, and that when the rootes are
runne beyond that small compasse wherein they were first set, and that
they are come to the barren or bad ground, they can thriue no better
then if they had beene set in that ground at the first, and if you
should afterwards digge beyond that compasse, intending to make the
ground better further off, you should much hurt the spreading rootes,
and put your trees in danger: the situation of hils in many places
is grauelly or chalky, which is not good for trees, because they are
both too stonie, and lacke mellow earth, wherein a tree doth most
ioy and prosper, and want moisture also (which is the life of all
trees) because of the quicke descent of raine to the lower grounds:
and besides all these inconueniences there is one more; your trees
planted either on hils or hill sides, are more subiect to the fury and
force of windes to be ouerturned, then those that growe in the lower
grounds; for the strongest and most forcible windes come not vsually
out of the North East parts, where you prouide best defence, but from
the South and West, whence you looke for the best comfort of the Sunne.
To helpe therefore manie of the inconueniences of the hils sides, it
were fit to cause manie leauels to bee made thereon, by raising the
lower grounds with good earth, and sustaining them with bricke or stone
wals, which although chargeable, will counteruaile your cost, beside
the pleasure of the walkes, and prospect of so worthy a worke. The
plaine or leuell grounds as they are the most frequent, so they are the
most commendable for an Orchard, because the moulds or earths are more
rich, or may better and sooner be made so; and therefore the profits
are the more may be raised from them. A stiffe clay doth nourish trees
well, by reason it containeth moisture; but in regard of the coldnesse
thereof, it killeth for the most part all tender and early things
therein: sea-cole ashes therefore, bucke ashes, streete soyle, chaulke
after it hath lyen abroad and been broken with many yeares frosts and
raine, and sheepes dung, are the most proper and fittest manure to
helpe this kinde of soyle. The dry sandy soile, and grauelly ground
are on the contrary side as bad, by reason of too much heate and lacke
of moisture: the dung of kine or cattell in good quantity bestowed
thereon, will much helpe them. The amending or bettering of other sorts
of grounds is set down toward the end of the first Chapter of the
first part of this worke, wherevnto I will referre you, not willing to
repeate againe the same things there set downe. The best way to auoide
and amend the inconueniences of high, boisterous, and cold windes, is
to plant Walnut trees, Elmes, Oakes or Ashes, a good distance without
the compasse of your Orchard, which after they are growne great, will
bee a great safeguard thereunto, by breaking the violence of the windes
from it. And if the soyle of your Orchard want moisture, the conueying
of the sinke of the house, as also any other draine of water thereinto,
if it may be, will much helpe it.




CHAP. II.

_The forme of an Orchard, both ordinary, and of more grace and rarity._

[Illustration: Diagram of a rectangle of dots, arranged in a diagonal
grid.]


According to the situation of mens grounds, so must the plantation of
them of necessitie be also; and if the ground be in forme, you shall
haue a formall Orchard: if otherwise, it can haue little grace or
forme. And indeed in the elder ages there was small care or heede taken
for the formality; for euery tree for the most part was planted without
order, euen where the master or keeper found a vacant place to plant
them in, so that oftentimes the ill placing of trees without sufficient
space betweene them, and negligence in not looking to vphold them,
procured more waste and spoile of fruit, then any accident of winde or
weather could doe. Orchards in most places haue not bricke or stone
wals to secure them, because the extent thereof being larger then of a
Garden, would require more cost, which euery one cannot vndergoe; and
therefore mud wals, or at the best a quicke set hedge, is the ordinary
and most vsuall defence it findeth almost in all places: but with those
that are of ability to compasse it with bricke or stone wals, the
gaining of ground, and profit of the fruit trees planted there against,
will in short time recompense that charge. If you make a doubt how to
be sure that your Orchard wall shall haue sufficient comfort of the
Sunne to ripen the fruits, in regard the trees in the Orchard being so
nigh thereunto, and so high withall, will so much shadow the wall, that
nothing will ripen well, because it will want the comfort of the Sunne:
you may follow this rule and aduice, to remedy those inconueniences.
Hauing an Orchard containing one acre of ground, two, three, or more,
or lesse, walled about, you may so order it, by leauing a broad and
large walke betweene the wall and it, containing twenty or twenty foure
foote (or yards if you will) that the wall shall not be hindered of
the Sun, but haue sufficient comfort for your trees, notwithstanding
the height of them, the distance betweene them and the wall being a
sufficient space for their shadow to fall into: and by compassing your
Orchard on the inside with a hedge (wherein may bee planted all sorts
of low shrubs or bushes, as Roses, Cornellian, Cherry trees plashed
lowe, Gooseberries, Curran trees, or the like) you may enclose your
walke, and keepe both it and your Orchard in better forme and manner,
then if it lay open. For the placing of your trees in this Orchard,
first for the wals: Those sides that lye open to the South & Southwest
Sunne, are fittest to bee planted with your tenderest and earliest
fruits, as Apricockes, Peaches, Nectarius, and May or early Cherries:
the East, North and West, for Plums and Quinces, as you shall like best
to place them. And for the Orchard it selfe, the ordinary manner is to
place them without regard of measure or difference, as Peares among
Apples, and Plums among Cherries promiscuously; but some keepe both a
distance and a diuision for euery sort, without intermingling: yet the
most gracefull Orchard containeth them all, with some others, so as
they be placed that one doe not hinder or spoile another; and therefore
to describe you the modell of an Orchard, both rare for comelinesse in
the proportion, and pleasing for the profitablenesse in the vse, and
also durable for continuance, regard this figure is here placed for
your direction, where you must obserue, that your trees are here set
in such an equall distance one from another euery way, & as is fittest
for them, that when they are grown great, the greater branches shall
not gall or rubbe one against another; for which purpose twenty or
sixteene foot is the least to be allowed for the distance euery way of
your trees, & being set in rowes euery one in the middle distance, will
be the most gracefull for the plantation, and besides, giue you way
sufficient to passe through them, to pruine, loppe, or dresse them, as
need shall require, and may also bee brought (if you please) to that
gracefull delight, that euery alley or distance may be formed like an
arch, the branches of either side meeting to be enterlaced together.
Now for the seuerall sorts of fruit trees that you shall place in
this modell, your best direction is to set Damsons, Bulleis, and your
taler growing Plums on the outside, and your lower Plums, Cherries,
and Apples on the inside, hauing regard, that you place no Peare tree
to the Sunward, or any other tree, lest it ouershadow them: Let your
Peare trees therefore be placed behinde, or on the one side of your
lower trees, that they may be as it were a shelter or defence on the
North & East side. Thus may you also plant Apples among Plums and
Cherries, so as you suffer not one to ouer-growe or ouer-toppe another;
for by pruning, lopping, and shredding those that growe too fast for
their fellowes, you may still keepe your trees in such a conformity,
as may be both most comely for the sight, and most profitable for the
yeelding of greater and better store of fruit. Other sorts of fruit
trees you may mixe among these, if you please, as Filberds, Cornellian
Cherries in standerds, and Medlers: but Seruice trees, Baye trees,
and others of that high sort, must be set to guard the rest. Thus
haue I giuen you the fairest forme could as yet be deuised; and from
this patterne, if you doe not follow it precisely, yet by it you may
proportion your Orchard, be it large or little, be it walled or hedged.




CHAP. III.

_Of a noursery for trees, both from sowing the kernels, and planting
fit stockes to graft vpon._


Although I know the greater sort (I meane the Nobility and better part
of the Gentrie of this Land) doe not intend to keepe a Nursery, to
raise vp those trees that they meane to plant their wals or Orchards
withall, but to buy them already grafted to their hands of them that
make their liuing of it: yet because many Gentlemen and others are much
delighted to bestowe their paines in grafting themselues, and esteeme
their owne labours and handie worke farre aboue other mens: for their
incouragement and satisfaction, I will here set downe some conuenient
directions, to enable them to raise an Orchard of all sorts of fruits
quickly, both by sowing the kernels or stones of fruit, and by making
choise of the best sorts of stockes to graft on: First therefore to
begin with Cherries; If you will make a Nursery, wherein you may bee
stored with plenty of stockes in a little space, take what quantitie
you thinke good of ordinarie wilde blacke Cherrie stones, cleansed
from the berries, and sowe them, or pricke them in one by one on a
peece of ground well turned vp, and large enough for the quantitie
of stones you will bestowe thereon, from the midst of August vnto
the end of September, which when they are two or three yeares old,
according to their growth, you may remoue them, and set them anew in
some orderly rowes, hauing pruned their tops and their rootes, which
at the next yeares growth after the new planting in any good ground,
or at the second, will be of sufficient bignesse to graft vpon in
the bud what sorts of Cherries you thinke best: and it is fittest to
graft them thus young, that pruning your stockes to raise them high,
you may graft them at fiue or six foote high, or higher, or lower, as
you shall see good, and being thus grafted in the bud, will both more
speedily and safely bring forward your grafts, and with lesse danger
of losing your stockes, then by grafting them in the stocke: for if
the bud take not by inoculating the first yeare, yet your tree is not
lost, nor put in any hazzard of losse; but may be grafted anew the
yeare following, if you will, in an other place thereof, whereas if
you graft in the stocke, and it doe not take, it is a great chance
if the stocke dye not wholly, or at least be not so weakened both in
strength and height, that it will not bee fit to bee grafted a yeare
or two after. In the same manner as you doe with the blacke, you may
deale with the ordinary English red Cherrie stones, or kernels, but
they are not so apt to growe so straight and high, nor in so short
a time as the blacke Cherrie stones are, and besides are subiect in
time to bring out suckers from the rootes, to the hinderance of the
stockes and grafts, or at the least to the deformitie of your Orchard,
and more trouble to the Gardiner, to pull or digge them away. Plumme
stones may bee ordered in this manner likewise, but you must make
choise of your Plums; for although euery Plumme is not so fit for this
purpose, as the white Peare Plumme, because it groweth the goalest and
freest, the barke being smooth and aptest to be raised, that they may
be grafted vpon; yet diuers other Plummes may be taken, if they be
not at hand, or to be had, as the blacke and red Peare Plumme, the
white and red Wheate Plumme, because they are nearest in goodnesse
vnto it. Peach stones will be soone raised vp to graft other sorts of
Peaches or Nectorins vpon, but the nature of the Peach roote being
spongie, is not to abide long. As for Almonds, they will be raised from
their stones to be trees of themselues; but they will hardly abide
the remouing, and lesse to bee grafted vpon. Apricocke stones are the
worst to deale withall of any sort of stone fruit; for although the
Apricocke branches are the fittest stockes to graft Nectorins of the
best sorts vpon, yet those that are raised from the kernels or stones
will neuer thriue to be brought on for this purpose; but will starue
and dye, or hardly grow in a long time to be a straight and fit stocke
to be grafted, if it be once remoued. Your Cornellian Cherrie trees are
wholly, or for the most part raised from the stones or kernels; yet I
know diuers doe increase them, by laying in their lowest branches to
take roote: and thus much for stone fruits. Now for Apples and Peares,
to be dealt withall in the same manner as aforesaid. They vse to take
the pressing of Crabs whereas Veriuyce is made, as also of Cidar and
Perry where they are made, and sowing them, doe raise vp great store
of stockes; for although the beating of the fruit doth spoile many
kernels, yet there will bee enough left that were neuer toucht, and
that will spring: the Crabbe stockes some preferre for the fittest, but
I am sure, that the better Apple and Peare kernels will growe fairer,
straighter, quicklier, and better to be grafted on. You must remember,
that after two or three yeares you take vp these stockes, and when you
haue pruned both toppe and roote, to set them againe in a thinner and
fitter order, to be afterwards grafted in the bud while they are young,
as I shall shew you by and by, or in the stocke if you will suffer them
to growe greater. Now likewise to know which are the fittest stockes of
all sorts to choose, thereon to graft euery of these sorts of fruits,
is a point of some skill indeede; and therefore obserue them as I doe
here set them downe: for bee you assured, that they are certaine rules,
and knowne experiences, whereunto you may trust without being deceiued.
Your blacke Cherrie stockes (as I said before) are the fittest and
best for all sorts of Cherries long to abide and prosper, and euen
May or early Cherry will abide or liue longer, being grafted thereon,
either in the budde or in the stocke, then on the ordinary red Cherry
stocke; but the red Cherry stocke is in a manner the onely tree that
most Nursery men doe take to graft May Cherries on in the stocke (for
it is but a late experience of many, to graft May Cherries in the bud)
many also doe graft May Cherries on Gascoigne Cherry stockes, which
doe not onely thriue well, but endure longer then vpon any ordinary
Cherry stocke: For indeede the May Cherries that are grafted vpon
ordinary red Cherrie stockes, will hardly hold aboue a dozen yeares
bearing well, although they come forwarder at the first, that is, doe
beare sooner then those that are grafted on Gascoigne or blacke Cherry
stockes; but as they are earlier in bearing, so they are sooner spent,
and the Gascoigne and blacked Cherry stockes that are longer in comming
forward, will last twice or thrice their time; but many more grafts
will misse in grafting of these, then of those red Cherry stockes, and
besides, the natures of the Gascoigne and blacke Cherry stockes are
to rise higher, and make a goodlier tree then the ordinary red stocke
will, which for the most part spreadeth wide, but riseth not very high.
The English red Cherry stocke will serue very well to graft any other
sort of Cherry vpon, and is vsed in most places of this Land, and I
know no other greater inconuenience in it, then that it shooteth out
many suckers from the roote, which yet by looking vnto may soone bee
remoued from doing any harme, and that it will not last so long as the
Gascoigne or blacke Cherry stocke will. May Cherries thus grafted lowe
doe most vsually serue to be planted against a wall, to bring on the
fruit the earlier; yet some graft them high vpon standards, although
not many, and it is, I thinke, rather curiosity (if they that doe
it haue any wals) then anie other matter that causeth them thus to
doe: for the fruit is naturally small, though early, and the standard
Cherries are alwaies later then the wall Cherries, so that if they can
spare any roome for them at their wals, they will not plant many in
standards. Now concerning Plummes (as I said before) for the sowing or
setting of the stones, so I say here for their choise in grafting of
them, either in the budde or stocke. The white Peare Plumme stocke,
and the other there mentioned, but especially the white Peare Plumme
is the goodliest, freest and fittest of all the rest, as well to graft
all sort of Plummes vpon, as also to graft Apricockes, which can be
handsomely, and to any good purpose grafted vpon no other Plum stocke,
to rise to bee worth the labour and paine. All sorts of Plums may be
grafted in the stocke, and so may they also in the bud; for I know none
of them that will refuse to be grafted in the bud, if a cunning hand
performe it well, that is, to take off your bud cleanely and well, when
you haue made choice of a fit cyon: for, as I shal shew you anon, it is
no small peece of cunning to chuse your cyon that it may yeeld fit buds
to graft withall, for euery plum is not of a like aptnes to yeeld them:
But Apricocks cannot be grafted in the stock for any thing that euer
I could heare or learne, but only in the bud, and therefore let your
Plum stocke bee of a reasonable size for Apricockes especially, and not
too small, that the graft ouergrow not the stocke, and that the stocke
bee large enough to nourish the graft. As your Plum stockes serue to
graft both Apricockes and Plummes, so doe they serue also very well
to graft Peaches of all sorts; and although Peach stockes will serue
to be grafted with Peaches againe, yet the Peach stocke (as I said
before) will not endure so long as the Plumme stocke, and therefore
serueth but for necessity if Plum stocks be not ready, or at hand, or
for the present time, or that they afterwards may graft that sort of
Peach on a Plumme stocke: for many might lose a good fruit, if when
they meete with it, and haue not Plumme stockes ready to graft it on,
they could not be assured that it would take vpon another Peach stocke
or branch, or on the branch of an Apricocke eyther. Plumme stockes will
serue likewise very well for some sorts of Nectorins; I say, for some
sorts, and not for all: the greene and the yellow Nectorin will best
thriue to be grafted immediately on a Plumme stocke; but the other two
sorts of red Nectorins must not be immediately grafted on the Plumme
stocke, but vpon a branch of an Apricocke that hath beene formerly
grafted on a Plumme stocke, the nature of these Nectorins being found
by experience to be so contrary to the Plum stocke, that it will sterue
it, and both dye within a yeare, two or three at the most: Diuers haue
tryed to graft these red Nectorins vpon Peach stockes, and they haue
endured well a while; but seeing the Peach stocke will not last long it
selfe, being ouerweake, how can it hold so strong a nature as these red
Nectorins, which will (as I said before) sterue a Plum stocke that is
sufficient durable for any other Plumme?

Apricocke stockes from the stones are hardly nursed vp, and worse to be
remoued, and if a red Nectorin should be grafted on an Apricock raysed
from the stone, and not remoued, I doubt it might happen with it as
it doth with many other trees raised from stones or kernels, and not
remoued, that they would hardly beare fruit: for the nature of most
trees raised from stones or kernels, and not remoued, is to send great
downe-right rootes, and not to spread many forwards; so that if they
be not cut away that others may spreade abroad, I haue seldome seene
or known any of them to beare in any reasonable time; and therefore in
remouing, these great downe-right rootes are alwayes shred away, and
thereby made fit to shoote others forwards. Hereby you may perceiue,
that these red Nectorins will not abide to bee grafted vpon any other
stocke well, then vpon an Apricocke branch, although the green and the
yellow (as I said before) will well endure and thriue vpon Plums. The
suckers or shootes both of Plums and Cherries that rise from their
rootes, eyther neare their stockes, or farther off, so that they bee
taken with some small rootes to them, will serue to bee stockes, and
will come forward quickly; but if the suckers haue no small roots
whereby they may comprehend in the ground, it is almost impossible it
should hold or abide. There is another way to rayse vp eyther stockes
to graft on, or trees without grafting, which is, by circumcising a
faire and fit branch in this manner: About Midsomer, when the sappe is
thoroughly risen (or before if the yeare be forward) they vse to binde
a good quantity of clay round about a faire and straight branch, of a
reasonable good size or bignesse, with some conuenient bands, whether
it be ropes of hey, or of any other thing, about an handfull aboue the
ioynt, where the branch spreadeth from the tree, and cutting the barke
thereof round about vnder the place where the clay is bound, the sap
is hereby hindered from rising, or descending further then that place
so circumcised, whereby it will shoote out small knubs and rootes
into the clay, which they suffer so to abide vntill the beginning of
winter, whenas with a fine Sawe they cut off that branch where it was
circumcised, and afterwardes place it in the ground where they would
haue it to grow, and stake it, and binde it fast, which will shoote
forth rootes, and will become eyther a faire tree to beare fruite
without grafting, or else a fit stocke to graft on according to the
kinde: but oftentimes this kinde of propagation misseth, in that it
sendeth not forth rootes sufficient to cause it to abide any long time.
Let me yet before I leaue this narration of Plummes, giue you one
admonition more, that vpon whatsoeuer Plumme stocke you doe graft, yet
vpon a Damson stocke that you neuer striue to graft, for it (aboue all
other sorts of Plumme stockes) will neuer giue you a tree worth your
labour. It remaineth only of stone fruit, that I speake of Cornelles,
which as yet I neuer saw grafted vpon any stocke, being as it should
seeme vtterly repugnant to the nature thereof, to abide grafting, but
is wholly raysed vp (as I said before) eyther from the stones, or
from the suckers or layers. For Peares and Apples your vsuall stockes
to graft on are (as I said before, speaking of the nursing vp of
trees from the kernels) your Crabbe stockes, and they bee accepted in
euery Countrey of this Land as they may conueniently be had, yet many
doe take the stockes of better fruit, whether they bee suckers, or
stockes raysed from the kernels (and the most common and knowne way of
grafting, is in the stocke for all sorts of them, although some doe
vse whipping, packing on, or incising, as euery one list to call it:
but now we doe in many places begin to deale with Peares and Apples as
with other stone fruit, that is, graft them all in the bud, which is
found the most compendious and safest way both to preserue your stocke
from perishing, and to bring them the sooner to couer the stock, as
also to make the goodlier and straighter tree, being grafted at what
height you please:) for those stockes that are raysed from the kernels
of good fruit (which are for the most part easily knowne from others,
in that they want those thornes or prickles the wilde kindes are armed
withall:) I say for the most part; for I know that the kernels of
some good fruite hath giuen stockes with prickles on them (which, as
I thinke, was because that good fruite was taken from a wilde stocke
that had not beene long enough grafted to alter his wilde nature; for
the longer a tree is grafted, the more strength the fruite taketh
from the graft, and the lesse still from the stocke) being smoother
and fairer then the wilde kinds, must needes make a goodlier tree,
and will not alter any whit the taste of your fruit that is grafted
thereon, but rather adde some better rellish thereunto; for the Crabbe
stockes yeelding harsh fruite, must giue part of their nature to the
grafts are set thereon, and therefore the taste or rellish, as well as
some other naturall properties of most fruits, are somewhat altered
by the stocke. Another thing I would willingly giue you to vnderstand
concerning your fruits and stockes, that whereas diuers for curiosity
and to try experiments haue grafted Cherries vpon Plumme stockes, or
Plums on Cherry stockes, Apples vpon Peare stockes, and Peares vpon
Apple stockes, some of these haue held the graft a yeare, two or three
peraduenture, but I neuer knew that euer they held long, or to beare
fruite, much lesse to abide or doe well: bestow not therefore your
paines and time on such contrary natures, vnlesse it be for curiositie,
as others haue done: Yet I know that they that graft peares on a white
thorne stocke haue had their grafts seeme to thriue well, and continue
long, but I haue seldome seene the fruite thereof answerable to the
naturall wilde Peare stocke; yet the Medlar is knowne to thriue best
on a white thorne. And lastly, whereas diuers doe affirme that they
may haue not only good stockes to graft vpon, but also faire trees to
bear store of fruit from the kernels of Peares or Apples being prickt
into the ground, and suffered to grow without remouing, and then eyther
grafted or suffered to grow into great trees vngrafted; and for their
bearing of fruite, assigne a dozen or twenty yeares from the first
setting of the kernels, and abiding vngrafted, I haue not seene or
heard that experience to hold certaine, or if it should be so, yet it
is too long time lost, and too much fruit also, to waite twenty yeares
for that profit may be gained in a great deale of lesse time, and with
more certainty. Vnto these instructions let mee adde also one more,
which is not much known and vsed, and that is, to haue fruit within
foure or fiue years from the first sowing of your stones or kernels in
this manner: After your stockes raysed from stones or kernels are two
or three yeares old, take the fairest toppe or branch, and graft it as
you would doe any other cyon taken from a bearing tree, and looke what
rare fruite, eyther Peare or Apple, the kernell was of that you sowed,
or Peach or Plum &c. the stone was set, such fruite shall you haue
within two or three yeares at the most after the grafting, if it take,
and the stocke be good. And thus may you see fruit in farre lesse time
then to stay vntill the tree from a kernell or stone beareth fruit of
it selfe.

_The diuers manners of grafting all sorts of fruits vsed in our Land._


The most vsuall manner of grafting in the stocke is so common and well
known in this Land to euery one that hath any thing to doe with trees
or an Orchard, that I think I shall take vpon mee a needlesse worke
to set downe that is so well knowne to most; yet how common soeuer
it is, some directions may profit euery one, without which it is not
easily learned. And I doe not so much spend my time and paines herein
for their sakes that haue knowledge, but for such as not knowing would
faine be taught priuately, I meane, to reade the rules of the arte
set downe in priuate, when they would refuse to learne of a Gardiner,
or other by sight: and yet I discommend not that way vnto them to
learne by sight; for one may see more in an instant by sight, then he
shall learn by his own practice in a great while, especially if he be
a little practised before he see a cunning hand to doe it. There are
many other kindes of grafting, which shall be spoken of hereafter, and
peraduenture euen they that know it well, may learne something they
knew not before.

1. The grafting in the stocke, is, to set the sprigge of a good fruit
into the body or stocke of another tree, bee it wilde or other, bee it
young or old, to cause that tree to bring forth such fruit as the tree
bore from whence you took the sprigge, and not such as the stocke or
tree would haue borne, if it had not beene grafted, and is performed in
this manner: Looke what tree or stocke you will chuse to graft on, you
must with a small fine sawe and very sharpe, whip off, or cut off the
head or toppe thereof at what height you eyther thinke best for your
purpose, or conuenient for the tree: for if you graft a great tree,
you cannot without endangering the whole, cut it downe so low to the
ground, as you may without danger doe a small tree, or one that is of
a reasonable size; and yet the lower or neerer the ground you graft a
young tree, the safer it is both for your stocke and graft, because
the sappe shall not ascend high, but soone giue vigour to the graft
to take and shoote quickly: After you haue cut off the toppe of your
stocke, cut or smooth the head thereof with a sharpe knife, that it may
be as plaine and smooth as you can, and then cleaue it with a hammer
or mallet, and with a strong knife, cleauer or chessell, either in the
middle of it if it be small, or of a reasonable size, or on the sides
an inch or more within the barke, if it be great: into both sides of
the cleft put your grafts, or into one if the stocke bee smaller; which
grafts must bee made fit for the purpose on this fashion: Hauing made
choise of your grafts from the toppe branches especially, or from the
sides of that tree whereof you would haue the fruit, and that they be
of a reasonable good size, not too small or too great for your stockes,
and of one or the same yeares shoote; (and yet many doe cut an inch or
more of the olde wood with the sprigge of the last yeares growth, and
so graft the old and young together, but both are good, and the old
wood no better then the young) cut your graft not too long, but with
two, three or foure eyes or buds at the most, which at the lower or
bigger end for an inch long or more (for the greater stockes, and an
inch or lesse for the lesser sort) must be so cut, that it be very thin
on the one side from the shoulders downward, and thicker on the other,
and thin also at the end, that it may goe downe close into the cleft,
and rest at the shoulders on the head of the stocke: but take heede
that in cutting your grafts your knife bee very sharpe that you doe
not rayse any of the barke, eyther at the sides or the end, for feare
of losing both your paines and graft, and stocke too peraduenture; and
let not your grafts bee made long before you set them, or else put the
ends of them in water to keepe them fresh and cleane: when you set
them you must open the cleft of your stocke with a wedge or chessell
as most doe, that the graft may goe easily into it, and that the
barke of both graft and stocke may ioyne close the one to the other,
which without stirring or displacing must bee so left in the cleft,
and the wedge or chessell gently pulled forth; but because in the
doing hereof consisteth in a manner the whole losse or gaine of your
paines, graft and stocke, to preuent which inconuenience I doe vse an
iron Instrument, the forme whereof is showne in the following page,
marked with the letter A, crooked at both ends, and broade like vnto
a chessell, the one bigger, and the other lesser, to fit all sorts of
stockes, and the iron handle somewhat long betweene them both, that
being thrust or knocked downe into the cleft, you may with your left
hand open it as wide as is fit to let in your graft, without strayning,
which being placed, this iron may bee pulled or knocked vp againe
without any mouing of your graft: when you haue thus done, you must
lay a good handfull or more (according to the bignesse of your stocke)
of soft and well moistned clay or loame, well tempered together with
short cut hey or horse dung, vpon the head of your stocke, as lowe or
somewhat lower then the cleft, to keepe out all winde, raine or ayre
from your graft vntill Midsomer at the least, that the graft be shot
forth somewhat strongly, which then if you please may be remoued, and
the cleft at the head only filled with a little clay to keepe out
earewigs, or other things that may hurt your graft.

[Illustration:

A. The Iron Instrument with chessels at each end, the one bigger and
  the other lesser, to keepe the cleft of the Tree open vntill the
  graft bee placed in the stocke, which with a knock vpwards will be
  easily taken away.

B. The small Penne-knife with a broad and thinne ended hafte, to raise
  the sides both of the bud and the down-right slit in the body or arme
  of a Tree to be grafted in the bud.

  backside.

5. The graft or bud now put into the stocke or tree you intend to be
  grafted: but the binding thereof is omitted.
]

2. Inarching is another manner of grafting in the stocke, and is more
troublesome, and more casuall also then the former, and is rather
a curiosity then any way of good speede, certainety or profit, and
therefore vsed but of a few. Yet to shew you, the manner thereof, it
is thus: Hauing a tree well growne, bee it high or low, yet the lower
the better, with young branches well spread, they vse to set stockes
round about it, or on the one side as you please; into which stockes
they ingraft the young branches of the well growne tree as they are
growing (before they cut them from the tree) by bowing downe the branch
they intend to graft, and putting it into the stocke, hauing first
cut off the head thereof, and cut a notch in the middle of the head
a little slope on both sides, wherein the branch must be fitted: let
the branch be cut thinne on the vnderside, only of that length as may
suffice to fit the notch in the stocke, leauing about halfe a yarde
length of the branch, to rise aboue or beyond the stocke, which beeing
bound on, and clayed ouer or couered with red or greene soft waxe, they
let so abide, that if it take in the stocke they cut off the branch a
little below the grafting place in Nouember following, and remouing
the stocke, they haue thus gained a grafted and growne tree the first
yeare: but it is vsually seene, that where one branch taketh, three doe
misse: yet this manner of grafting was much in vse for May Cherries,
when they were first known to vs, and the way thought to be a rare
manner of grafting to encrease them, vntill a better way was found
out, which now is so common and good also, that this is not now scarce
thought vpon.

3. Another kinde of grafting in the stocke is called of some whipping,
of some splicing, of others incising, and of others packing on (and as
I heare, is much vsed in the West parts especially, and also in the
North parts of this Land) and is performed in this manner: Take and
slice the branch of a tree (so as the branch be not too bigge) or else
a young tree of two, or three, or foure yeares growth at the most,
quite off slope wise, about an inch and a halfe long or more, and cut
a deep notch in the middle thereof, then fit into it a graft iust of
that size or bignesse, cut on both sides with shoulders, and thin at
the end, that it may ioyne close in the notch, and neyther bigger or
lesser, but that the barke of the one may bee fitted iust to the barke
of the other, the figure wherof is expressed at the letters E.F. which
shew the one to be with a shoulder & the other without; binde them
gently together with bast, and put clay or waxe ouer the place, vntill
it be taken: this is much vsed of late dayes for such young trees as
are risen of stones or kernels after the second or third yeares growth,
and thriue very well in that it not only saueth much time, but diuers
checks by remouing and grafting.

4. Inoculating or grafting in the budde is another manner of grafting,
which is the taking of a budde from one tree, and putting it into the
barke of another tree, to the end, that thereby you may haue of the
same kinde of fruit the tree bare from whence the budde was taken; and
although it bee sufficiently knowne in many places of this Land, yet
as I vnderstand, good Gardiners in the North parts, and likewise in
some other places, can scarce tell what it meaneth, or at the least
how to doe it well. It is performed after a different fashion from the
former, although they all tend vnto one end, which is the propagating
of trees. You must for this purpose obserue, that for those trees you
would graft, either with, or vpon, you choose a fit time in Summer,
when the sappe is well risen, and your graft well shot, that the barke
will rise easily and cleanly, both of stocke and graft, which time I
cannot appoint, because both the years doe differ in earlinesse, and
the seuerall parts or countries of this Land likewise one from another,
but most vsually in these Southerne parts, from the beginning of Iune
vnto the end of it, or to the middle of Iuly, or either somewhat before
or after. First (as I said) hauing taken the fitted time of the yeare,
you must take especiall care, that your grafts be well growne, and of
the same yeares shoote, and also that the buds or eyes haue but single
leaues at them, as neere as you can: for I would vtterly refuse those
buds that haue aboue two leaues as vnprofitable, either in Peaches
or any other fruit; and therefore see that your grafts or cyons bee
taken from the chiefest place of the tree, that is, either from the
toppe, or from a sunnie side thereof, and not from the contrarie side
if you may otherwise, nor from any vnder-boughes; for seeing your
graft is so small a thing, you had neede take the more care that it be
the best and fairest. You must to take off this eye or budde from the
sprigge, haue a small sharpe pen-knife, the end of the haft being made
flat and thinne, like a chessell or wedge, the figure whereof is set
forth at the letter B, and a pen or goose quill cut, to be lesse then
halfe round, and to be broad at the end, but not sharpe pointed like a
penne, or else such a peece of bone or Iuorie made in that fashion as
the quill is, to bee thinne, hollow, or halfe round, the figures of
both which are marked with the letters C, D, with your knife cut the
barke of the bud (hauing first cut off the leafe, leauing onely the
short foote-stalke thereof at the bud) about a strawes breadth aboue
the eye thereof halfe round, and then from that round or ouerthwart
cut, with your knife cut it downe on both sides of the eye, close to
the bud slopewise about an inch long or thereabouts, that it bee broad
at the head aboue the eye, and pointing at the end like a sheild or
scutcheon; and then cutting away the rest of the barke from about it,
with the thinne flat end of the haft of your knife raise vp both sides
of your bud a little, and with your quill or bone put vnder the barke,
raise your budde, and thrust it quite off, beginning at the toppe or
head of your eye; but see that you thrust it off close to the wood of
the branch or sprigge, and that you doe not leaue the eye of the budde
behinde sticking vpon the branch; for if that eye be left or lost, your
bud is worth nothing; you must cast it away, and cut another that may
haue that eye abiding within the budde on the inside: you may perceiue
if that eye be wanting, if you see an emptie hole in the place where
the eye should be, to fill it vp on the inside thereof; thus hauing
taken off your bud well and cleanly, which is set forth vnto you at
the figures, 3 and 4. presently set it on the tree you would graft
(for your small budde can abide no delay, lest by taking the ayre too
long it become dry, and nothing worth) in this manner: Cut the barke
of your tree you would graft in a smooth place, at what height you
please, first aboue or ouerthwart, and then downe right in the middle
thereof, more then an inch long, the figure whereof you shall haue at
the figure 1. and then raise vp both sides of the barke, first one,
and then another, with the flat and thinne haft end of your knife, a
prettie way inwards (for if the barke will not rise easily, the stocke
is not then fit to graft vpon) put in your budde into the cleft with
the point downewards, holding the stalke of the leafe that is with the
budde betweene your fingers of the one hand, and opening the cleft
with the flat end of your knife with the other hand, that the head of
your bud may be put close vnder the ouerthwart cut in the stocke or
tree (which must not be raised or stirred as the sides are) & the eye
of the bud stand iust in the middle of the slit that is downeright,
and then closing the barke of the stocke or tree softly vnto the bud
thus put in with your fingers, let it be bound gently with a small
long peece of baste, or other such like soft thing, first aboue the
eye, & then compassing it belowe as close as you can, but not too
hard in any case, vntil you haue bound it all ouer the slit you made,
especially the lower end, lest any winde get in to dry and spoile it;
and hauing tyed both ends thereof fast, leaue it so for a fortnight
or somewhat more, in which space it will take and hold, if it be well
done, which you shall perceiue, if the bud abide green, and turne not
blacke, when you haue vnloosed the tying; for if it hold fast to the
tree, and be fresh and good, tye it vp gently againe, and so leaue it
for a fortnight longer, or a moneth if you will, and then you may take
away your binding cleane: this budde will (if no other mischance happen
vnto it) spring and shoote forth the next yeare, (and sometimes the
same yeare, but that is seldome) and therefore in the beginning of the
yeare, cut off the head of the grafted tree about an handfull aboue the
grafted place, vntill the graft be growne strong, and then cut it off
close, that the head may be couered with the graft, and doe not suffer
any buds to sprout besides the graft, either aboue or belowe it. If
you graft diuers buds vpon one stocke (which is the best way) let that
onely remaine and abide that shooteth best forth, and rubbe off, or
take away the other: the seuerall parts of this grafting I haue caused
to be expressed for your further information.

5. Grafting in the scutcheon is accounted another kinde of grafting,
and differeth verie little from grafting in the budde: the difference
chiefly consisteth in this, that in stead of the downe right slit, and
that aboue ouerthwart, they take away iust so much barke of the great
tree, as your budde is in bignesse, which vsually is a little larger
then the former, and placing it therein, they binde it as formerly
is said: some vse for this purpose a paire of compasses, to giue the
true measure both of bud and stocke; this manner of grafting is most
vsed vpon greater trees, whose young branches are too high to graft
vpon in the former maner, and whose tops they cut off (for the most
part) at the latter end of the next yeare after the bud is taken: both
these waies were inuented to saue the losse of trees, which are more
endangered by grafting in the stocke, then any of these waies; and
besides, by these waies you may graft at a farre greater height without
losse.




CHAP. V.

_Of the manner of grafting and propagating all sorts of Roses._


Hauing now spoken of the grafting of trees, let mee adioyne the
properties of Roses, which although they better fit a Garden then an
Orchard, yet I could not in a fitter place expresse them then here,
both for the name and affinity of grafting, & because I do not expresse
it in the first part. All sorts of Roses may be grafted (although all
sorts are not, some seruing rather for stockes for others to be grafted
on) as easily as any other tree, & is only performed, by inoculating
in the same maner I haue set downe in the former Chapter of grafting
trees in the bud; for both stocke and budde must bee dealt with after
the same fashion. And although some haue boasted of grafting Roses
by dicing or whipping, as they call it, or in the stocke, after the
first manner, set downe in the former Chapter, yet I thinke it rather
a bragge, not hauing seene or heard any true effect proceede from that
relation. The sweete Briar or Eglantine, the white and the Damaske
Roses, are the chiefest stockes to graft vpon. And if you graft lowe or
neare the ground, you may by laying downe that graft within the ground,
after it hath bin shot out well, and of a years growth, by pinning it
fast downe with short stickes, a thwart or acrosse, cause that grafted
branch, by taking roote, to become a naturall Rose, such as the graft
was, which being separated and transplanted after it hath taken root
wel, will prosper as well as any naturall sucker. And in this maner,
by laying downe branches at length into the ground, if they be full of
spreading small branches, you may increase all sorts of Roses quickly
and plentifully; for they will shoote forth rootes at the ioynts of
euery branch: But as for the manner of grafting white Roses or Damaske
vpon Broome stalkes or Barbary bushes, to cause them to bring forth
double yellow Roses, or vpon a Willowe, to beare greene Roses, they
are all idle conceits, as impossible to be effected, as other things,
whereof I haue spoken in the ninth Chapter of my first part, concerning
a Garden of flowers, vnto which I referre you to be satisfied with the
reasons there alledged. And it is the more needlesse, because we haue
a naturall double yellow Rose of it owne growing. The sowing of the
seedes of Roses (which are sometimes found vpon most sorts of Roses,
although not euery yeare, and in euerie place) hath bin formerly much
vsed; but now the laying downe of the young shootes is a way for
increase so much vsed, being safe and verie speedie to take, especially
for those Roses that are not so apt to giue suckers, that it hath
almost taken quite away the vse of sowing of the seedes of Roses, which
yet if anie one be disposed to make the triall, they must gather the
seede out of the round heads, from amongst the doune, wherein they lye
verie like vnto the berries of the Eglantine or sweete Briar bush, and
especially of those Roses that bee of the more single kindes, which
are more apt to giue berries for seed then the more double, although
sometimes the double Roses yeeld the like heads or berries. Their time
of sowing is in the end of September (yet some reserue them vntill
February) and their manner of noursing is to bee transplanted, after
the first or second yeares growth, and tended carefully, that while
they are young they be not lost for want of moisture in the dry time of
Summer.




CHAP. VI.

_Certaine rules and obseruations in and after grafting, not remembred
in the former Chapter._


The time of some manners of grafting being not mentioned before, must
here be spoken of. For the grafting of all sorts of trees in the
stocke, the most vsuall time is from the middle of February vntill
the middle of March, as the yeare and the countrie is more forward
or backward, with vs about London wee neuer passe midde March: but
because the May Cherrie is first ripe, and therefore of a very forward
nature, it doth require to be grafted somewhat sooner then others.
The time of gathering likewise, or cutting your grafts for grafting
in the stocke, is to be obserued, that they bee not long gathered
before they bee grafted, for feare of being too dry, which I commend,
howsoeuer diuers say, if they be long kept they are not the worse; and
therefore if you be forced to haue your grafts from farre, or by some
other chance to keepe them long, be carefull to keepe them moist, by
keeping their ends stucke in moist clay; but if neare hand, neglect no
time I say after the cutting of them for their grafting, but either
the same, or the next day, or verie speedily after, in the meane time
being put into the ground to keepe them fresh. The grafts taken from
old trees, because they are stronger, and shoote forth sooner, are to
bee sooner grafted then those that are taken from younger trees: of a
good branch may bee made two, and sometimes three grafts sufficient
for anie reasonable stocke. For whipping, the time is somewhat later
then grafting in the stocke, because it is performed on younger trees,
which (as I said before) doe not so early bud or shoote forth as the
elder. Inarching likewise is performed much about the later end of the
grafting time in the stocke; for being both kindes thereof they require
the same time of the yeare. The times of the other manners of graftings
are before expressed, to bee when they haue shot forth young branches,
from whence your buds must be taken; and therefore need not here againe
to be repeated. If a graft in the stocke doth happen not to shoote
forth when others do (so as it holdeth green) it may perchance shoot
out a moneth or two after, & do well, or else after Midsummer, when a
second time of shooting, or the after Spring appeareth: but haue an
especiall care, that you take not such a graft that shal haue nothing
but buds for flowers vpon it, and not an eye or bud for leaues (which
you must be carefull to distinguish) for such a graft after it hath
shot out the flowers must of necessitie dye, not hauing wherewith to
maintaine it selfe. Also if your good graft doe misse, and not take,
it doth hazzard your stocke at the first time, yet manie stockes doe
recouer to be grafted the second time; but twice to faile is deadly,
which is not so in the inoculating of buds in the greene tree: for
if you faile there in three, or three times three, yet euerie wound
being small, and the tree still growing greene, will quickly recouer
it, and not be afterwards seen. Some vse to graft in the stocke the
same yeare they remoue the stocke, to saue time, & a second checke by
grafting; but I like better both in grafting in the stocke, and in
the bud also, that your trees might be planted in the places where
you would haue them growe, for a yeare or two at the least before you
graft them, that after grafting there should be no remouall, I neede
not be tedious, nor yet I hope verie sollicitous to remember many other
triuiall, or at the least common knowne things in this matter. First,
for the time to remoue trees, young or old, grafted or vngrafted, to
be from a fortnight after Michaelmas vntill Candlemas, or if neede be,
somewhat after, yet the sooner your remoue is, the better your trees
will thriue, except it be in a very moist ground. For the manner or way
to set them: _viz._ in the high and dry grounds set them deeper, both
to haue the more moisture, and to be the better defended from windes;
and in the lower and moister grounds Shallower, and that the earth be
mellow, well turned vp, and that the finer earth bee put among the
small rootes, wherein they may spread, and afterwards gently troden
downe, that no hollownesse remaine among the rootes: as also that after
setting (if the time be not ouermoist) there may be some water powred
to the rootes, to moisten and fasten them the better; and in the dry
time of Summer, after the setting, let them not want moisture, if you
will haue them thriue and prosper; for the want thereof at that time,
hath often killed manie a likely tree. To stake and fence them also if
neede bee after they are new set, and so to continue for two or three
yeares after, is verie expedient, lest windes or other casualties
spoile your paines, and ouerthrow your hopes. And likewise to defend
your grafts from birds lighting on them, to breake or displace them, to
sticke some prickes or sharpe pointed stickes longer then your graft
into your clay, that so they may be a sure defence of it: As also to
tye some woollen cloathes about the lower end of your stockes, or
thrust in some thornes into the ground about the rootes, to defend them
from hauing their barkes eaten by Conies, or hurt by some other noisome
vermine.




CHAP. VII.

_Obseruations for the dressing and well keeping of Trees and an Orchard
in good order._


There are two manner of waies to dresse and keepe trees in good
order, that they may bee both gracefull and fruitfull; the one is
for wall-trees, the other is for standards: for as their formes are
different, so is their keeping or ordering. Wall trees, because they
are grafted lowe, and that their branches must be plasht or tackt vnto
the wall to fasten them, are to be so kept, that all their branches
may be suffered to growe, that shoote forth on either side of the
bodie, and led either along the wall, or vpright, and one to lappe ouer
or vnder another as is conuenient, and still with peeces of lists,
parings of felt, peeces of soft leather, or other such like soft thing
compassing the armes or branches, fastened with small or great nailes,
as neede requireth, to the wals, onely those buds or branches are to
be nipped or cut off, that shoot forward, and will not so handsomely
be brought into conformity, as is fitting; yet if the branches growe
too thicke, to hinder the good of the rest, or too high for the wall,
they may, nay they must be cut away or lopped off: and if anie dead
branches also happen to be on the trees, they must be cut away, that
the rest may haue the more libertie to thriue. Diuers also by carefully
nipping away the waste and superfluous buds, doe keepe their trees in
conformity, without much cutting. The time to pruine or plash, or tye
vp wall trees, is vsually from the fall of the leafe, to the beginning
of the yeare, when they begin to blossome, and most especially a little
before or after Christmas: but in any case not too late, for feare of
rubbing off their buds. Some I know doe plash and tye vp their wall
trees after bearing time, while the leaues are greene, and their reason
is, the buds are not so easie or apt to bee rubbed from the branches
at that time, as at Christmas, when they are more growne: but the
leaues must needes be very cumbersome, to hinder much both the orderly
placing, and close fastening of them to the wall. This labour you must
performe euery yeare in its due time; for if you shall neglect and
ouerslip it, you shall haue much more trouble, to bring them into a
fit order againe, then at the first. The standard trees in an Orchard
must be kept in another order; for whereas the former are suffered to
spread at large, these must be pruined both from superfluous branches
that ouerload the trees, & make them lesse fruitfull, as well as lesse
sightly, and the vnder or water boughes likewise, that drawe much
nourishment from the trees and yet themselues little the better for
it, I meane to giue fruit. If therefore your Orchard consist of young
trees, with a little care and paines it may bee kept in that comely
order and proportion it was first defined vnto; but if it consist of
old growne trees, they will not without a great deale of care and
paines be brought into such conformitie, as is befitting good, and
comely trees: for the marke of those boughes or branches that are cut
off from young trees, will quickly be healed againe, the barke growing
quickly ouer them, whereby they are not worse for the cutting, but an
old tree if you cut off a bough, you must cut it close and cleanly, and
lay a searcloth of tallow, waxe, and a little pitch melted together
vpon the place, to keepe off both the winde, sunne, and raine, untill
the barke haue couered it ouer againe: and in this manner you must
deale with all such short stumps of branches, as are either broken
short off with the winde, or by carelesnesse or want of skill, or else
such armes or branches as are broken off close, or sliued from the
body of the tree: for the raine beating and falling into such a place,
will in short time rotte your tree, or put it in danger, besides the
deformity. Some vse to fill vp such an hole with well tempered clay,
and tacke a cloth or a peece of leather ouer it vntill it be recouered,
and this is also not amisse. Your young trees, if they stand in anie
good ground, will bee plentifull enough in shooting forth branches;
bee carefull therefore if they growe too thicke, that you pruine away
such as growe too close (and will, if they be suffered, spoile one
another) as they may be best spared, that so the sunne, ayre, and raine
may haue free accesse to all your branches, which will make them beare
the more plentifully, and ripen them the sooner and the more kindly.
If anie boughes growe at the toppe too high, cut them also away, that
your trees may rather spread then growe too high. And so likewise for
the vnder boughes, or anie other that by the weight of fruit fall or
hang downe, cut them off at the halfe, and they will afterwards rise
and shoote vpwards. You shall obserue, that at all those places where
anie branches haue been cut away, the sappe will euer bee readie to
put forth: if therefore you would haue no more branches rise from that
place, rubbe off or nippe off such buddes as are not to your minde when
they are new shot: and thus you may keep your trees in good order with
a little paines, after you haue thus pruined and dressed them. One
other thing I would aduertise you of, and that is how to preserue a
fainting or decaying tree which is readie to perish, if it be not gone
too farre or past cure, take a good quantitie of oxe or horse bloud,
mixe therewith a reasonable quantitie of sheepe or pigeons dung, which
being laid to the roote, will by the often raines and much watering
recouer it selfe, if there bee anie possibilitie; but this must bee
done in Ianuarie or Februarie at the furthest.




CHAP. VIII.

_Diuers other obseruations to be remembred in the well keeping of an
Orchard._


There be diuers other things to be mentioned, whereof care must be
had, either to doe or auoide, which I thinke fit in this Chapter
promiscuously to set down, that there may be nothing wanting to furnish
you with sufficient knowledge of the care, paines, and casualties that
befall an Orchard: for it hath many enemies, and euery one laboureth
as much as in them lye, to spoile you of your pleasure, or profit, or
both, which must bee both speedily and carefully preuented and helped;
and they are these: Mosse, Caterpillars, Ants, Earwigs, Snailes,
Moales, and Birds. If Mosse begin to ouergrowe your trees, looke to
it betimes, lest it make your trees barren: Some vse to hacke, and
crossehacke, or cut the barke of the bodies of their trees, to cause
it fall away; but I feare it may endanger your trees. Others do either
rubbe it off with a haire cloth, or with a long peece of wood formed
like a knife, at the end of a long sticke or pole, which if it bee vsed
cauteiously without hurting the buds, I like better. Caterpillars, some
smoake them with burning wet strawe or hay, or such like stuffe vnder
the trees; but I doe not greatly like of that way: others cut off the
boughes whereon they breed, and tread them vnder their feete, but that
will spoile too manie branches; and some kill them with their hands,
but some doe vse a new deuised way, that is, a pompe made of lattin or
tin, spout-fashion, which being set in a tubbe of water vnder or neare
your trees, they will cause the water to rise through it with such a
force, and through the branches, that it will wash them off quickly.
To destroy Ants, that eate your fruit before and when it is ripe, some
vse to annoint the bodies of their trees with tarre, that they may not
creepe vp on the branches; but if that doe not helpe, or you will not
vse it, you must be careful to finde out their hill, and turne it vp,
pouring in scalding water, either in Summer, but especially if you can
in Winter, and that will surely destroy them. I haue spoken of Earwigs
in the first part of this worke, entreating of the annoyances of
Gilloflowers, and therefore I referre you thereunto: yet one way more
I will here relate which some doe vse, and that is with hollow canes
of halfe a yard long or more, open at both ends for them to creepe in,
and stucke or laid among the branches of your trees, will soone drawe
into them many Earwigs, which you may soone kill, by knocking the cane
a little vpon the ground, and treading on them with your foote. Snailes
must be taken with your hands, and that euerie day, especially in the
morning when they will be creeping abroad. Moales by running vnder
your trees make them lesse fruitfull, and also put them in danger to
be blowne downe, by leauing the ground hollow, that thereby the rootes
haue not that strength in the ground, both to shoote and to hold, that
otherwise they might haue. Some haue vsed to put Garlicke, and other
such like things into their holes, thinking thereby to driue them away,
but to no purpose: others haue tryed manie other waies; but no way
doth auaile anie thing, but killing them either with a Moale spade,
or a trappe made for the purpose as manie doe know: and they must bee
watched at their principall hill, and trenched round, and so to be
caught. Birds are another enemie both to your trees and fruit; for the
Bullfinch will destroy all your stone fruit in the budde, before they
flower, if you suffer them, and Crowes, &c. when your Cherries are
ripe: for the smaller birds, Lime twigs set either neare your trees,
or at the next water where they drinke, will helpe to catch them and
destroy them. And for the greater birds, a stone bowe, a birding or
fowling peece will helpe to lessen their number, and make the rest more
quiet: or a mill with a clacke to scarre them away, vntill your fruit
be gathered. Some other annoyances there are, as suckers that rise
from the rootes of your trees, which must be taken away euerie yeare,
and not suffered to growe anie thing great, for feare of robbing your
trees of their liuelihood. Barke bound, is when a tree doth not shoote
and increase, by reason the barke is as it were drie, and will not
suffer the sappe to passe vnto the branches: take a knife therefore,
and slit the barke downe almost all the length of the tree in two or
three places, and it will remedy that euill, and the tree will thriue
and come forward the better after. Barke pilled is another euill that
happeneth to some trees, as well young as old, either by reason of
casuall hurts, or by the gnawing of beasts, howsoeuer it bee, if it
bee anie great hurt, lay a plaister thereon made of tallow, tarre,
and a little pitch, and binde it thereto, letting it so abide vntill
the wound bee healed: yet some doe only apply a little clay or loame
bound on with ropes of hay. The Canker is a shrewd disease when it
happeneth to a tree; for it will eate the barke round, and so kill the
very heart in a little space. It must be looked vnto in time before
it hath runne too farre; most men doe wholly cut away as much as is
fretted with the Canker, and then dresse it, or wet it with vinegar or
Cowes pisse, or Cowes dung and vrine, &c. vntill it be destroyed, and
after healed againe with your salue before appointed. There are yet
some other enemies to an Orchard: for if your fence be not of bricke
or stone, but either a mudde wall, or a quicke set or dead hedge, then
looke to it the more carefully, and preuent the comming in of either
horse, or kine, sheepe, goates, or deere, hare, or conie; for some of
them will breake through or ouer to barke your trees, and the least
hole almost in the hedge will giue admittance to hares and conies to
doe the like. To preuent all which, your care must be continuall to
watch them or auoide them, and to stoppe vp their entrance. A dogge is
a good seruant for many such purposes, and so is a stone bowe, and a
peece to make vse of as occasion shall serue. But if you will take that
medicine for a Canker spoken of before, which is Cowes dung and vrine
mixed together, and with a brush wash your trees often to a reasonable
height, will keepe hares and conies from eating or barking your trees.
Great and cold windes doe often make a great spoile in an Orchard, but
great trees planted without the compasse thereof, as Wall-nuts, Oakes,
Elmes, Ashes, and the like, will stand it in great stead, to defend
it both early and late. Thus haue I shewed you most of the euils that
may happen to an Orchard, and the meanes to helpe them, and because
the number is great and daily growing, the care and paines must be
continuall, the more earnest and diligent, lest you lose that in a
moment that hath been growing many yeares, or at the least the profit
or beauty of some yeares fruit.




CHAP. IX.

_The manner and way how to plant, order, and keepe other trees that
beare greene leaues continually._


The way to order those trees that beare their leaues greene
continually, is differing from all others that doe not so: for neyther
are they to bee planted or remoued at the time that all other trees
are set, nor doe they require that manner of dressing, pruining and
keeping, that others doe. And although many ignorant persons and
Gardiners doe remoue Bay trees, and are so likewise perswaded that all
other trees of that nature, that is, that carry their greene leaues
continually, may bee remoued in Autumne or Winter, as well as all other
trees may bee, yet it is certaine it is a great chance if they doe
thriue and prosper that are set at that time, or rather it is found by
experience, that scarce one of ten prospereth well that are so ordered.
Now in regard that there be diuers trees and shrubs mentioned here in
this booke that beare euer greene leaues, wherein there is very great
beauty, and many take pleasure in them; as the ordinary Bay, the Rose
Bay, and the Cherry Bay trees, the Indian Figge, the Cypresse, the Pine
tree, the Mirtle and dwarfe Boxe, and many others; I will here shew you
how to plant and order them, as is fittest for them. For in that they
doe not shed their greene leaues in winter as other trees doe, you may
in reason be perswaded that they are of another nature; and so they are
indeede: for seeing they all grow naturally in warme Countries, and
are from thence brought vnto vs, we must both plant them in a warmer
place, and transplant them in a warmer time then other trees be, or
else it is a great hazzard if they doe not perish and dye, the cold
and frosts in the winter being able to pierce them through, if they
should bee transplanted in winter, before they haue taken roote. You
must obserue and take this therefore for a certaine rule, that you
alwaies remoue such trees or shrubbes as are euer greene in the spring
of the yeare, and at no time else if you will doe well, that is, from
the end of March, or beginning of Aprill, vnto the middle or end of
May, especially your more dainty and tender plants, shadowing them
also for a while from the heate of the Sun, and giuing them a little
water vpon their planting or transplanting; but such water as hath not
perfectly been drawn from a Well or Pumpe, for that will go neer to
kill any plant, but such water as hath stood in the open ayre for a day
at the least, if not two or three. Yet for dwarfe Boxe I confesse it
may endure one moneth to be earlier planted then the rest, because it
is both a more hardy and lowe plant, and thereby not so much subiect to
the extremitie of the colde: but if you should plant it before winter,
the frosts would raise it out of the ground, because it cannot so soone
at that time of the yeare take roote, and thereby put it in danger to
be lost. Moreouer all of them will not abide the extremitie of our
winter frosts, and therefore you must of necessity house some of them,
as the Rose Bay, Mirtle, and some others, but the other sorts being set
where they may bee somewhat defended from the cold windes, frostes,
and snow in winter, with some couering or shelter for the time, will
reasonably well endure and beare their fruit, or the most of them. If
any be desirous to be furnished with store of these kinds of trees
that will be noursed vp in our Country, he may by sowing the seed of
them in square or long woodden boxes or chests made for that purpose,
gaine plenty of them: but hee must be carefull to couer them in winter
with some straw or fearne, or beane hame, or such like thing layd vpon
crosse sticks to beare it vp from the plants, and after two or three
yeares that they are growne somewhat great and strong, they may bee
transplanted into such places you meane they shall abide: yet it is
not amisse to defend them the first yeare after they are transplanted,
for their more securitie: the seedes that are most vsually sowen with
vs, are, the Cypresse tree, the Pine tree, the Baye, the Pyracantha
or prickly Corall tree, and the Mirtle: the Rose Bay I haue had also
risen from the seede that was fresh, and brought me from Spaine. But
as for Orenge trees, because they are so hardly preserued in this our
cold climate (vnlesse it bee with some that doe bestow the housing
of them, besides a great deale more of care and respect vnto them)
from the bitternesse of our cold long winter weather (although their
kernels being put into the ground in the Spring or Summer, and if care
bee had of them and conuenient keeping, will abide, and by grafting the
good fruite on the crab stocke they may bee in time nursed vp) I doe
not make any other especiall account of them, nor giue you any further
relation of their ordering. Now for the ordering of these trees after
they are eyther planted of young sets, or transplanted from the seede,
it is thus: First for Bay trees, the most vsuall way is to let them
grow vp high to bee trees, and many plant them on the North or East
side of their houses that they may not bee scorched with the Sunne;
but the bitter winters which we often haue, doe pinch them shrewdly,
insomuch that it killeth euen well growne trees sometimes downe to the
roote: but some doe make a hedge of them being planted in order, and
keep them low by lopping of them continually, which will make them bush
and spread. The Cypresse tree is neuer lopped, but suffered to grow
with all the branches from a foote aboue the ground, if it may be,
straight vpright; for that is his natiue grace and greatest beautie,
and therefore the more branches doe dye that they must bee cut away,
the more you deforme his propertie. The Pine tree may be vsed in the
same manner, but yet it wil better endure to sustaine pruining then the
Cypresse, without any such deformitie. The Laurocerasus or Cherry Bay
may be diuersly formed, that is, it may be either made to grow into
a tall tree by shredding still away the vnder branches, or else by
suffering all the branches to grow to be a low or hedge bush, and both
by the suckers and by laying downe the lower branches into the earth,
you may soone haue much increase; but this way will cause it to bee the
longer before it beare anie fruit. The Rose Baye will verie hardlie bee
encreased either by suckers or by layers, but must bee suffered to grow
without lopping, topping or cutting. The Pyracantha or Prickly Corall
tree may bee made to grow into a reasonable tall tree by shredding away
the lower branches, or it may be suffered to grow lowe into an hedge
bush, by suffering all the branches to grow continually, you may also
propagate it by the suckers, or by laying downe the lower branches.
The Myrtle of all sorts abideth a low bush spreading his branches full
of sweete leaues and flowers, without anie great encrease of it selfe,
yet sometimes it giueth suckers or shootes from the rootes: but for the
more speedie propagating of them, some doe put the cuttings of them
into the earth, and thereby increase them. There are some other trees
that are not of any great respect, as the Yew tree, and the Savine
bush, both which may be encreased by the cuttings, and therefore I need
not make any further relation or amplification of them, and to say thus
much of them all, is (I thinke) sufficient for this Worke.




CHAP. X.

_The ordering, curing, and propagating Vines of all sorts._


In most places of this countrie there is small care or paines taken
about the ordering of Vines: it sufficeth for the most part with them
that haue anie, to make a frame for it to spread vpon aboue a mans
height, or to tacke it to a wall or window, &c. and so to let it
hang downe with the branches and fruit, vntill the weight thereof,
and the force of windes doe teare it downe oftentimes, and spoile
the grapes: and this way doth somewhat resemble that course that the
Vineyard keepers obserue in the hot countries of Syria, Spaine, and
Italy, and in the farthest parts of France as I hear likewise: for
in most of these hot countries they vse to plant an Oliue betweene
two Vines, and let them runne thereupon. But manie of the other parts
of France, &c. doe not suffer anie trees to growe among their Vines;
and therefore they plant them thicke, and pruine them much and often,
and keepe them lowe in comparison of the other way, fastening them to
pearches or poles to hold them vp. And according to that fashion may
haue aduentured to make Vineyards in England, not onely in these later
daies, but in ancient times, as may wel witnesse the sundrie places
in this Land, entituled by the name of Vineyards; and I haue read
that manie Monasteries in this Kingdome hauing Vineyards, had as much
wine made therefrom, as sufficed their conuents yeare by yeare: but
long since they haue been destroyed, and the knowledge how to order
a Vineyard is also vtterly perished with them. For although diuers,
both Nobles and Gentlemen, haue in these later times endeauoured to
plant and make Vineyards, and to that purpose haue caused French men,
being skilfull in keeping and dressing of Vines, to be brought ouer to
performe it, yet either their skill failed them, or their Vines were
not good, or (the most likely) the soile was not fitting, for they
could neuer make anie wine that was worth the drinking, being so small
and heartlesse, that they soone gaue ouer their practice. And indeede
the soile is a maine matter to bee chiefly considered to seate a
Vineyard vpon: for euen in France and other hot countries, according to
the nature of the soile, so is the rellish, strength, and durabilitie
of the wine. Now although I think it a fruitlesse labour for any man
to striue in these daies to make a good Vineyard in England, in regard
not only of the want of knowledge, to make choise of the fitted ground
for such Vines as you would plant thereupon but also of the true maner
of ordering them in our country; but most chiefly & aboue all others,
that our years in these times do not fal out to be so kindly and hot,
to ripen the grapes, to make anie good wine as formerly they haue done;
yet I thinke it not amisse, to giue you instructions how to order such
Vines as you may nourse vp for the pleasure of the fruit, to eate the
grapes being ripe, or to preserue and keepe them to bee eaten almost
all the winter following: And this may be done without any great or
extraordinarie paines. Some doe make a lowe wall, and plant their Vines
against it, and keepe them much about the height thereof, not suffering
them to rise much higher: but if the high bricke or stone wals of
your Garden or Orchard haue buttresses thereat, or if you cause such
to bee made, that they bee somewhat broade forwards, you may the more
conueniently plant Vines of diuers sorts at them, and by sticking down
a couple of good stakes at euery buttresse, of eight or ten foot high
aboue ground, tacking a few lathes acrosse vpon those stakes, you may
thereunto tye your Vines, & carry them theron at your pleasure: but you
must be carefull to cut them euery year, but not too late, and so keepe
them downe, and from farre spreading, that they neuer runne much beyond
the frame which you set at the buttresses: as also in your cutting
you neuer leaue too many ioynts, nor yet too few, but at the third or
fourth ioint at the most cut them off. I doe aduise you to these frames
made with stakes and lathes, for the better ripening of your grapes:
for in the blooming time, if the branches of your vines bee too neare
the wall, the reflection of the Sunne in the day time, and the colde in
the night, doe oftentimes spoile a great deale of fruit, by piercing
and withering the tender footstalkes of the grapes, before they are
formed, whereas when the blossomes are past, and the fruit growing of
some bignesse, then all the heate and reflection you can giue them is
fit, and therefore cut away some of the branches with the leaues, to
admit the more Sunne to ripen the fruit. For the diuers sorts of grapes
I haue set them downe in the Booke following, with briefe notes vpon
euerie of them, whether white or blacke, small or great, early or late
ripe; so that I neede not here make the same relation again. There doth
happen some diseases to Vines sometimes, which that you may helpe, I
thinke it conuenient to informe you what they are, and how to remedy
them when you shall be troubled with any such. The first is a luxurious
spreading of branches and but little or no fruit: for remedie whereof,
cut the branches somewhat more neere then vsuall, and bare the roote,
but take heed of wounding or hurting it, and in the hole put either
some good old rotten stable dung of Horses, or else some Oxe blood new
taken from the beasts, and that in the middle of Ianuarie or beginning
of Februarie, which being well tempered and turned in with the earth,
let it so abide, which no doubt, when the comfort of the blood or dung
is well soaked to the bottome by the raines that fall thereon, will
cause your Vine to fructifie againe. Another fault is, when a Vine doth
not bring the fruit to ripenesse, but either it withereth before it
be growne of any bignesse, or presently after the blooming: the place
or the earth where such a Vine standeth, assuredly is too cold, and
therefore if the fault bee not in the place, which cannot bee helped
without remouing to a better, digge out a good quantity of that earth,
and put into the place thereof some good fresh ground well heartned
with dung, and some sand mixed therewith (but not salt or salt water,
as some doe aduise, nor yet vrine as others would haue) and this will
hearten and strengthen your Vine to beare out the fruit vnto maturitie.
When the leaues of a Vine in the end of Summer or in Autumne, vntimely
doe turne either yellow or red, it is a great signe the earth is too
hot and drie; you must therefore in stead of dung and sand, as in the
former defect is said, put in some fresh loame or short clay, well
mixed together with some of the earth, and so let them abide, that the
frosts may mellow them. And lastly, a Vine sometimes beareth some store
of grapes, but they are too many for it to bring to ripenesse; you
shall therefore helpe such a Vine (which no doubt is of some excellent
kinde, for they are most vsually subiect to this fault) by nipping away
the blossomes from the branches, and leauing but one or two bunches at
the most vpon a branch, vntill the Vine be growne older, and thereby
stronger, and by this meane inured to beare out all the grapes to
ripenesse. These be all the diseases I know doe happen to Vines: for
the bleeding of a Vine it seldome happeneth of it selfe, but commeth
either by cutting it vntimely, that is, too late in the yeare, (for
after Ianuarie, if you will be well aduised, cut not any Vine) or by
some casuall or wilfull breaking of an arme or a branch. This bleeding
in some is vnto death, in others it stayeth after a certaine space of
it selfe: To helpe this inconuenience, some haue seared the place where
it bleedeth with an hot iron, which in many haue done but a little
good; others haue bound the barke close with packe-thred to stay it;
and some haue tied ouer the place, being first dried as well as may
bee, a plaister made with waxe rossen and turpentine while it is warme.
Now for the propagating of them: You must take the fairest and goalest
shot branches of one yeares growth, and cut them off with a peece of
the old wood vnto it, and these being put into the ground before the
end of Ianuarie at the furthest, will shoote forth, and take roote, and
so become Vines of the same kinde from whence you tooke them. This is
the most speedy way to haue increase: for the laying downe of branches
to take roote, doth not yeelde such store so plentifully, nor doe
suckers rise from the rootes so aboundantly; yet both these waies doe
yeelde Vines that being taken from the old stockes will become young
plants, fit to bee disposed of as any shall thinke meete.




CHAP. XI.

_The way to order and preserue grapes, fit to be eaten almost all the
Winter long, and sometimes vnto the Spring._


Although it bee common and vsuall in the parts beyond the Sea to dry
their grapes in the Sunne, thereby to preserue them all the year, as
the Raisins of the Sunne are, which cannot bee done in our Countrie
for the want of sufficient heate thereof at that time: or otherwise to
scald them in hot water (as I heare) and afterwards to dry them, and so
keepe them all the yeare, as our Malaga Raisins are prepared that are
packed vp into Frayles: yet I doe intend to shew you some other waies
to preserue the grapes of our Countrie fresh, that they may be eaten
in the winter both before and after Christmas with as much delight and
pleasure almost, as when they were new gathered. One way is, when you
haue gathered your grapes you intend to keepe, which must be in a dry
time, and that all the shrunke, dried, or euill grapes in euery bunch
be picked away, and hauing prouided a vessell to hold them, be it of
wood or stone which you will, and a sufficient quantitie of faire and
cleane drie sand; make _stratum super stratum_ of your grapes and the
sand, that is, a lay of sand in the bottome first, and a lay of grapes
vpon them, and a lay or strowing againe of sand vpon those grapes,
so that the sand may couer euery lay of grapes a fingers breadth in
thicknesse, which being done one vpon another vntill the vessell be
full, and a lay of sand vppermost, let the vessell be stopped close,
and set by vntill you please to spend them, being kept in some drie
place and in no sellar: let them bee washed cleane in faire water to
take away the sand from so many you will spend at a time. Another way
is (which Camerarius setteth downe he was informed the Turkes vse to
keepe grapes all the winter vnto the next summer) to take so much meale
of Mustard seede, as will serue to strow vpon grapes, vntill they haue
filled their vessels, thereon afterwards they poure new wine before it
hath boiled, to fill vp their vessels therwith, and being stopped vp
close, they keepe them a certaine time, and selling them with their
liquour to them that will vse them, they doe wash the seedes or meale
from them when they vse them. Another way is, that hauing gathered
the fairest ripe grapes, they are to be cast vpon threds or strings
that are fastened at both ends to the side walls of a chamber, neere
vnto the seeling thereof, that no one bunch touch another, which will
bee so kept a great while, yet the chamber must be well defended from
the frosts, and cold windes that pierce in at the windowes, lest they
perish the sooner: and some will dippe the ends of the branches they
hang vp first in molten pitch, thinking by searing vp the ends to keepe
the bunches the better; but I doe not see any great likelihood therein.
Your chamber or closet you appoint out for this purpose must also bee
kept somewhat warme, but especially in the more cold and frostie time
of the yeare, lest it spoile all your cost and paines, and frustrate
you of all your hopes: but although the frosts should pierce and spoile
some of the grapes on a bunch, yet if you be carefull to keepe the
place warme, the fewer will be spoiled. And thus haue I shewed you the
best directions to order this Orchard rightly, and all the waies I
know are vsed in our Countrie to keep grapes good anie long time after
the gathering, in regard wee haue not that comfort of a hotter Sun to
preserue them by its heate.

The fruits themselues shall follow euerie one in their order; the lower
shrubbes or bushes first, and the greater afterwards.




THE THIRD PART CALLED THE ORCHARD,


Containing all sorts of trees bearing fruit for mans vse to eate,
proper and fit for to plant an Orchard in our climate and countrie: I
bound it with this limitation, because both Dates, Oliues, and other
fruits, are planted in the Orchards of Spaine, Italy, and other hot
countries, which will not abide in ours. Yet herein I will declare
whatsoeuer Art, striuing with Nature, can cause to prosper with vs,
that whosoeuer will, may see what can bee effected in our countrie. And
first to begin with the lower shrubbes or bushes, and after ascend to
the higher trees.




CHAP. I.

_Rubus Idæus._   Raspis.


The Raspis berrie is of two sorts, white and red, not differing in the
forme either of bush, leafe, or berry, but onely in the colour and
taste of the fruit. The Raspis bush hath tender whitish stemmes, with
reddish small prickes like haires set round about them, especially at
the first when they are young; but when they grow old they become more
wooddy and firme, without any shew of thornes or prickles vpon them,
and hath onely a little hairinesse that couereth them: the leaues are
somewhat rough or rugged, and wrinkled, standing three or fiue vpon a
stalke, somewhat like vnto Roses, but greater, and of a grayer greene
colour: the flowers are small, made of fine whitish round leaues, with
a dash as it were of blush cast ouer them, many standing together, yet
euery one vpon his owne stalke, at the tops of the branches; after
which come vp small berries, somewhat bigger then Strawberries, and
longer, either red or white, made of many graines, more eminent then
in the Strawberry, with a kinde of douninesse cast ouer them, of a
pleasant taste, yet somewhat sowre, and nothing so pleasant as the
Strawberrie. The white Raspis is a little more pleasant then the red,
wherein there is small seede inclosed: the rootes creepe vnder ground
verie farre, and shoote vp againe in many places, much encreasing
thereby.

There is another whose stemme and branches are wholly without prickles:
the fruit is red, and somewhat longer, and a little more sharpe.


        The Vse of Raspis.

        The leaues of Raspis may be vsed for want of Bramble leaues
        in gargles, and other decoctions that are cooling and drying,
        although not fully to that effect.

        The Conserue or Syrupe made of the berries, is effectuall to
        coole an hot stomacke, helping to refresh and quicken vp those
        that are ouercome with faintnesse.

        The berries are eaten in the Summer time, as an afternoones
        dish, to please the taste of the sicke as well as the sound.

        The iuyce and the distilled water of the berries are verie
        comfortable and cordiall.

        It is generally held of many, but how true I know not, that the
        red wine that is vsually sold at the Vintners, is made of the
        berries of Raspis that grow in colder countries, which giueth
        it a kinde of harshnesse: And also that of the same berries
        growing in hotter climates, which giueth vnto the wine a more
        pleasant sweetnesse, is made that wine which the Vintners call
        Alligant: but we haue a Vine or Grape come to vs vnder the
        name of the Alligant Grape, as you shall finde it set downe
        hereafter among the Grapes; and therefore it is likely to be
        but an opinion, and no truth in this, as it may be also in the
        other.




CHAP. II.

_Ribes rubra, alba, nigra._   Currans red, white, and blacke.


The bushes that beare those berries, which are vsually called red
Currans, are not those Currans either blew or red, that are sold at
the Grocers, nor any kind thereof; for that they are the grapes of a
certaine Vine, as shall be shewed by and by: but a farre differing
kinde of berry, whereof there are three sorts, red, white, and blacke.

The red Curran bush is of two sorts, and groweth to the height of a
man, hauing sometimes a stemme of two inches thicknesse, and diuers
armes and branches, couered with a smooth, darke, brownish barke,
without anie pricke or thorne at all vpon anie part thereof, whereon
doe growe large cornered blackish greene leaues, cut in on the edges,
seeming to be made of fiue parts, almost like a Vine leafe, the ends a
little pointing out, and standing one aboue another on both sides of
the branches: the flowers are little and hollow, comming forth at the
ioynts of the leaues, growing many together on a long stalke, hanging
downe aboue a fingers length, and of an herbie colour: after which come
small round fruit or berries, greene at the first, and red as a Cherry
when they are ripe, of a pleasant and tart taste: the other differeth
not in anie other thing then in the berries, being twice as bigge as
the former: the roote is wooddy, and spreadeth diuersly.

The white Curran bush riseth vsually both higher then the red, and
straighter or more vpright, bigger also in the stemme, and couered with
a whiter barke: the leaues are cornered, somewhat like the former, but
not so large: the flowers are small and hollow like the other, hanging
downe in the same manner on long stalkes, being of a whiter colour:
the berries likewise growe on the long stalkes, somewhat thicker set
together, and of a cleare white colour, with a little blacke head, so
transparent that the seedes may be easily seene thorough them, and of a
more pleasant winie taste then the red by much.

The blacke Curran bush riseth higher then the white, with more
plentifull branches, and more pliant and twiggie: the stemme and the
elder branches being couered with a brownish barke, and the younger
with a paler: the flowers are also like vnto little bottles as the
others be, of a greenish purple colour, which turne into blacke
berries, of the bignesse of the smaller red Currans: the leaues are
somewhat like vnto the leaues of the red Currans, but not so large:
both branches, leaues, and fruit haue a kind of stinking sent with
them, yet they are not vnwholsome, but the berries are eaten of many,
without offending either taste or smell.

        The Vse of Currans.

        The red Currans are vsually eaten when they are ripe, as a
        refreshing to an hot stomacke in the heate of the yeare, which
        by the tartnesse is much delighted. Some preserue them, and
        conserue them also as other fruits, and spend them at neede.

        The white Currans, by reason of the more pleasant winie taste,
        are more accepted and desired, as also because they are more
        daintie, and lesse common.

        Some vse both the leaues and berries of the blacke Currans in
        sawces, and other meates, and are well pleased both with the
        sauour and taste thereof, although many mislike it.




CHAP. III.

_Vua Crispa siue Grossularia._   Gooseberries or Feaberries.


Wee haue diuers sorts of Gooseberries, besides the common kinde, which
is of three sorts, small, great, and long. For wee haue three red
Gooseberries, a blew and a greene.

The common Gooseberrie, or Feaberrie bush, as it is called in diuers
Countries of England, hath oftentimes a great stemme, couered with a
smooth darke coloured bark, without anie thorne thereon, but the elder
branches haue here and there some on them, and the younger are whitish,
armed with verie sharpe and cruell crooked thorns, which no mans hand
can well auoide that doth handle them, whereon are set verie greene
and small cornered leaues cut in, of the fashion almost of Smallage,
or Hawthorne leaues, but broad at the stalke: the flowers come forth
single, at euerie ioynt of the leafe one or two, of a purplish greene
colour, hollow and turning vp the brims a little: the berries follow,
bearing the flowers on the heads of them, which are of a pale greene
at the first, and of a greenish yellow colour when they are ripe,
striped in diuers places, and cleare, almost transparent, in which
the seede lyeth. In some these berries are small and round; in others
much greater; a third is great, but longer then the other: all of them
haue a pleasant winie taste, acceptable to the stomacke of anie (but
the long kinde hath both the thicker skin, and the worser taste of the
other) and none haue been distempered by the eating of them, that euer
I could heare of.

The first of the red Gooseberries is better knowne I thinke then the
rest, and by reason of the small bearing not much regarded; the stemme
is somewhat bigge, and couered with a smooth darke coloured barke, the
younger branches are whiter, and without anie thorne or pricke at all,
so long, weake, small, and slender, that they lye vpon the ground,
and will there roote againe: the leaues are like vnto the former
Gooseberries, but larger: the flowers and berries stand single, and
not manie to bee found anie yeare vpon them, but are somewhat long,
and are as great as the ordinarie Gooseberry, of a darke brownish red
colour, almost blackish when they are ripe, and of a sweetish taste,
but without any great delight.

The second red Gooseberry riseth vp with a more straight stemme,
couered with a brownish barke; the young branches are straight
likewise, and whitish, and grow not so thicke vpon it as the former red
kinde, and without any thorne also vpon them: the leaues are like vnto
the former red, but smaller: the berries stand singly at the leaues as
Gooseberries doe, and are of a fine red colour when they are ripe, but
change with standing to be of a darker red colour, of the bignesse of
the small ordinary Gooseberry, of a pretty tart taste, and somewhat
sweete withall.

The third red Gooseberry which is the greatest, and knowne but vnto
few, is so like vnto the common great Gooseberry, that it is hardly
distinguished: the fruit or berries grow as plentifully on the branches
as the ordinary, and are as great & round as the great ordinary kinde,
but reddish, and some of them paler, with red stripes.

The blew Gooseberry riseth vp to bee a bush like vnto the red Curran,
and of the same bignesse and height, with broader and redder leaues at
the first shooting out, then the second red Gooseberry: the berries are
more sparingly set on the branches, then on the small red, and much
about the same bignesse, or rather lesser, of the colour of a Damson,
with an ouershadowing of a blewish colour vpon them, as the Damson
hath, before it be handled or wiped away.

The greene prickly Gooseberry is very like vnto the ordinary Gooseberry
in stemme and branches, but that they are not stored with so many
sharpe prickles; but the young shootes are more plentifull in small
prickles about, and the greene leafe is a little smaller: the flowers
are alike, and so are the berries, being of a middle size, and not
very great, greene when they are thorough ripe as well as before, but
mellower, and hauing a few small short prickles, like small short
haires vpon them, which are harmlesse, and without danger to anie the
most dainty and tender palate that is, and of a verie good pleasant
taste. The seede hereof hath produced bushes bearing berries, hauing
few or no prickles vpon them.


        The Vse of Gooseberries.

        The berries of the ordinary Gooseberries, while they are small,
        greene, and hard, are much vsed to bee boyled or scalded to
        make sawce, both for fish and flesh of diuers sorts, for the
        sicke sometimes as well as the sound, as also before they bee
        neere ripe, to bake into tarts, or otherwise, after manie
        fashions, as the cunning of the Cooke, or the pleasure of his
        commanders will appoint. They are a fit dish for women with
        childe to stay their longings, and to procure an appetite vnto
        meate.

        The other sorts are not vsed in Cookery that I know, but serue
        to bee eaten at pleasure; but in regard they are not so tart
        before maturity as the former, they are not put to those vses
        they be.




CHAP. IIII.

_Oxyacantha, sed potius Berberis._   Barberries.


The Barberry bush groweth oftentimes with very high stemmes, almost two
mens height, but vsually somewhat lower, with manie shootes from the
roote, couered with a whitish rinde or barke, and yellow vnderneath,
the wood being white and pithy in the middle: the leaues are small,
long, and very greene, nicked or finely dented about the edges, with
three small white sharpe thornes, for the most part set together at the
setting on of the leaues: the flowers doe growe vpon long clustering
stalkes, small, round, and yellow, sweete in smell while they are
fresh, which turne into small, long, and round berries, white at the
first, and very red when they are ripe, of a sharpe sowre taste, fit to
set their teeth on edge that eate them: the roote is yellow, spreading
far vnder the vpper part of the ground, but not very deepe.

There is (as it is thought) another kinde, whose berries are thrice as
bigge as the former, which I confesse I haue not seene, and know not
whether it be true or no: for it may peraduenture be but the same, the
goodnesse of the ground and ayre where they growe, and the youngnesse
of the bushes causing that largenesse, as I haue obserued in the same
kinde, to yeeld greater berries.

There is said to be also another kinde, whose berries should be without
stones or seede within them, not differing else in anie thing from the
former: but because I haue long heard of it, and cannot vnderstand by
all the inquirie I haue made, that any hath seene such a fruit, I rest
doubtfull of it.

        The Vse of Barberries.

        Some doe vse the leaues of Barberries in the stead of Sorrell,
        to make sawce for meate, and by reason of their sowrenesse are
        of the same quality.

        The berries are vsed to be pickled, to serue to trimme or
        set out dishes of fish and flesh in broth, or otherwise, as
        also sometime to bee boyled in the broth, to giue it a sharpe
        rellish, and many other wayes, as a Master Cooke can better
        tell then my selfe.

        The berries are preserued and conserued to giue to sicke
        bodies, to helpe to coole any heate in the stomacke or mouth,
        and quicken the appetite.

        The depurate iuyce is a fine menstrue to dissolue many things,
        and to verie good purpose, if it be cunningly handled by an
        Artist.

        The yellow inner barke of the branches, or of the rootes, are
        vsed to be boyled in Ale, or other drinkes, to be giuen to
        those that haue the yellow iaundise: As also for them that haue
        anie fluxes of choller, to helpe to stay and binde.

        Clusius setteth downe a secret that hee had of a friend, of
        a cleane differing propertie, which was, that if the yellow
        barke were laid in steepe in white wine for the space of
        three houres, and afterwards drunke, it would purge one very
        wonderfully.




CHAP. V.

_Nux Auellana._   The Filberd.


The Filberd tree that is planted in Orchards, is very like vnto the
Hasell nut tree that groweth wilde in the woods, growing vpright,
parted into many boughes and tough plyable twigges, without knots,
couered with a brownish, speckled, smooth, thinne rinde, and greene
vnderneath: the leaues are broad, large, wrinkled, and full of veines,
cut in on the edges into deepe dents, but not into any gashes, of a
darke greene colour on the vpperside, and of a grayish ash colour
vnderneath: it hath small and long catkins in stead of flowers, that
come forth in the Winter, when as they are firme and close, and in the
Spring open themselues somewhat more, growing longer, and of a brownish
yellow colour: the nuts come not vpon those stalkes that bore those
catkins, but by themselues, and are wholly inclosed in long, thicke,
rough huskes, bearded as it were at the vpper ends, or cut into diuers
long iagges, much more then the wood nut: the nut hath a thinne and
somewhat hard shell, but not so thicke and hard as the wood nut, in
some longer then in other, and in the long kinde, one hath the skinne
white that couereth the kernels, and another red.

There is another sort of the round kinde that came from Constantinople,
whose huske is more cut, torne, or iagged, both aboue and belowe, then
any of our country; the barke also is whiter, and more rugged then
ours, and the leaues somewhat larger.

We haue had from Virginia Hasell nuts, that haue beene smaller,
rounder, browner, thinner sheld, and more pointed at the end then ours:
I know not if any hath planted of them, or if they differ in leafe or
any thing else.

        The Vse of Filberds.

        Filberds are eaten as the best kinde of Hasell nuts, at bankets
        among other dainty fruits, according to the season of the
        yeare, or otherwise, as euery one please: But Macer hath a
        Verse, expressing prettily the nature of these nuts, which is,

        that is, There is no wholsome food or nourishment had from
        these small kinde of nuts.

        Yet they are vsed sometime physically to be rosted, and made
        into a Lohoc or Electuary, that is vsed for the cough or cold.
        And it is thought of some, that Mithridates meant the kernels
        of these nuts, to be vsed with Figs and Rue for his Antidote,
        and not of Walnuts.




CHAP. VI.

_Vitis._   The Vine.


There is so great diuersities of Grapes, and so consequently of
Vines that bear them, that I cannot giue you names to all that here
grow with vs: for Iohn Tradescante my verie good friend, so often
before remembred, hath assured me, that he hath twentie sorts growing
with him, that hee neuer knew how or by what name to call them. One
description therefore shall serue (as I vse to doe in such varieties)
for all the rest, with the names afterwards, of as many as we can giue,
and the seuerall formes, colours and proportions of the grapes.

The manured Vine, in the places where it hath abiden long time, groweth
to haue a great bodie, stemme or trunke, sometimes of the bignesse of
a mans arme, sleeue and all, spreading branches if it bee suffered
without end or measure, but vsually stored with many armes or branches,
both old and new, but weake, and therefore must bee sustained; whereof
the old are couered with a thin scaly rinde, which will often chap and
peele off of it selfe; the youngest being of a reddish colour, smooth
and firme, with a hollownesse or pith in the middle: from the ioints of
the young branches, and sometimes from the bodie of the elder, breake
out on euerie side broade greene leaues, cut on the edges into fiue
diuisions for the most part, and besides notched or dented about: right
against the leafe, and likewise at other ioynts of the branches, come
forth long twining or clasping tendrels, winding themselues about any
thing standeth next vnto them: at the bottome of these leaues come
forth clusters of small greenish yellow bloomes or flowers, and after
them the berries, growing in the same manner in clusters, but of diuers
formes, colours, tastes and greatnesse. For some grapes are great,
others lesse, some very small (as the Currans that the Grocers sell)
some white, some red, blew, blacke, or partie-coloured, some are as it
were square, others round: some the clusters are close, others open,
some are sweete, others sower or harsh, or of some other mixed taste;
euerie one differing from others, verie notably either in taste, colour
or forme; within euerie one of which grapes, (and yet there is a grape
without stones) are contained one, two, or more kernels or stones, some
of them being smal, others greater: the rootes spread far and deepe.
They that keepe their Vines in the best order, doe cut them low, not
suffering them to grow high, or with too many branches, whereby they
grow the better, take vp the lesser roome, and bring their grapes
fairer and sweeter.


        The kindes of Vines and Grapes.

        Our ordinarie Grape both white and red, which excelleth Crabs
        for veriuice, and is not fit for wine with vs.

        The white Muscadine Grape is a verie great Grape, sweete and
        firme, some of the bunches haue weighed sixe pound, and some of
        the grapes halfe an ounce.

        The redde Muscadine is as great as the white, and chiefly
        differeth in colour.

        The Burlet is a very great white Grape, but fitter for
        veriuice; then wine for the most part; yet when a hot yeare
        happeneth fit for it, the Grape is pleasant.

        The little blacke Grape that is ripe very early.

        The Raisin of the Sunne Grape is a very great Grape, and very
        great clusters, of a reddish colour when it is ripe with vs,
        yet in an extraordinarie hot yeare, it hath got a little
        blewnesse cast ouer by the best: but naturally verie blew.

        The Curran Grape (or the Grape of Corinth) is the least Grape
        of all, and beareth both few, and verie seldome with vs, but in
        reasonable great clusters, and of a blackish blew colour, when
        they are ripe with vs, and very sweete. There is another sort
        of them that are red or browne, and of a sower taste, nothing
        so sweete.

        The Greeke wine Grape is a blackish Grape, and very sweete.

        The Frontignack is a white Grape, of a verie sweete and
        delicate taste, as the wine declareth, that smelleth as it were
        of Muske.

        The square Grape is reported to bear a Grape not fully round,
        but sided, or as it were square, whereby it became so called.

        The Damasco Grape is a great white grape, very sweete, and is
        the true _Vva Zibeba_, that the Apothecaries should vse in the
        _Trochisci Ciphi_: and such wee haue had in former times come
        ouer vnto vs in great, long and round white boxes, containing
        halfe an hundred weight a peece.

        The Russet Grape is a reasonable faire grape, exceeding sweet
        and whitish, with a thicke skinne, crusted ouer with a shew of
        ash colour.

        The white long Grape is like vnto a Pigeons egge, or as it were
        pointed pendent like a Pearle.

        The partie-coloured Grape is a reasonable great Grape, and
        discoloured when it is ripe, sometimes the whole bunches, and
        sometimes but some of the grapes being parted whitish, and
        blacke halfe through, verie variably.

        The Rhenish wine Grape is a white Grape, and endureth the cold
        of winter when it commeth earely, more then the Muscadine
        before set downe, and is nothing so sweete.

        The White wine Grape is verie like vnto the Rhine Grape, the
        soile only and climate adding more sweetnesse vnto the one then
        to the other.

        The Claret wine Grape is altogether like the white Grape, but
        that it is not white, but of a reddish colour, which lying
        bruised vpon the skins before they are pressed, giue that
        Claret tincture to the wine.

        The Teint is a Grape of a deeper or darker colour, whose iuice
        is of so deepe a colour, that it serueth to colour other wine.

        The Bursarobe is a faire sweete white Grape of much esteeme
        about Paris.

        The Alligant is a verie sweete Grape, giuing so deep and liuely
        a coloured red wine, that no other whatsoeuer is comparable to
        it, and therefore vsually called Spaniards blood.

        The blew or blacke Grape of Orleans is another blacke Grape,
        giuing a darke coloured sweete wine much commended in those
        parts.

        The Grape without stones is also a kinde by it selfe, and
        groweth naturally neere Ascalon, as Brochard affirmeth, the
        wine whereof is redde, and of a good taste.

        The Virginia Vine, whereof I must needes make mention among
        other Vines, beareth small Grapes without any great store of
        iuice therein, and the stone within it bigger then in any other
        Grape: naturally it runneth on the ground, and beareth little.

        The Vse of Vines, Grapes, and other parts that come of them.

        The greene leaues of the Vine are cooling and binding, and
        therefore good to put among other herbes that make gargles and
        lotions for sore mouthes.

        And also to put into the broths and drinke of those that haue
        hot burning feauers, or any other inflammation.

        They stay (as it is held for true) womens longings, if they be
        either taken inwardly, or applyed outwardly.

        Wine is vsually taken both for drinke and medicine, and is
        often put into sawces, broths, cawdles, and gellies that are
        giuen to the sicke. As also into diuers Physicall drinkes, to
        be as a _vehiculum_ for the properties of the ingredients.

        It is distilled likewise after diuers manners, with diuers
        things, for diuers & sundry waters to drinke, & for diuers
        purposes both inward and outward.

        Also distilled of it selfe, is called Spirit of wine, which
        serueth to dissolue, and to draw out the tincture of diuers
        things, and for many other purposes.

        The iuice or veriuice that is made of greene hard grapes,
        before they be ripe, is vsed of the Apothecaries to be made
        into a Syrupe, that is very good to coole and refresh a faint
        stomacke.

        And being made of the riper grapes is the best veriuice, farre
        exceeding that which is made of crabs, to be kept all the
        yeare, to be put both into meates and medicines.

        The grapes of the best sorts of Vines are pressed into wine by
        some in these dayes with vs, and much more as I verily beleeue
        in times past, as by the name of Vineyard giuen to many places
        in this Kingdome, especially where Abbies and Monasteries
        stood, may bee coniectured: but the wine of late made hath
        beene but small, and not durable, like that which commeth from
        beyond Sea, whether our vnkindly yeares, or the want of skill,
        or a conuenient place for a Vineyard be the cause, I cannot
        well tell you.

        Grapes of all sorts are familiarly eaten when they are ripe, of
        the sicke sometimes as well as the sound.

        The dryed grapes which we call great Raysins, and the Currans
        which we call small Raysins, are much vsed both for meates,
        broths, and sawces, in diuers manners, and this Countrey in
        generall aboue any other, wherein many thousands of Frailes
        full, Pipes, Hogs-heads, and Buts full are spent yearly, that
        it breedeth a wonder in them of those parts where they growe
        and prouide them, how we could spend so many.

        The Raysins of the Sunne are the best dryed grapes, next vnto
        the Damasco, and are very wholsome to eate fasting, both to
        nourish, and to helpe to loosen the belly.

        The dryed Lees of wine called Argoll or Tartar, is put to the
        vse of the Goldsmith, Dyer, and Apothecary, who doe all vse it
        in seuerall manners, euery one in his art.

        Of it the Apothecaries make _Cremor Tartari_, a fine medicine
        to bee vsed, as the Physitian can best appoint, and doth helpe
        to purge humours by the stoole.

        Thereof likewise they make a kinde of water or oyle, fit to bee
        vsed, to take away freckles, spots, or any such deformities of
        the face or skinne, and to make it smooth. It causeth likewise
        haire to growe more aboundantly in those places where it
        naturally should growe.

        The liquor of the Vine that runneth forth when it is cut, is
        commended to be good against the stone wheresoeuer it be; but
        that liquor that is taken from the end of the branches when
        they are burnt, is most effectuall to take away spots and
        markes, ring-wormes and tetters in any place.




CHAP. VII.

_Ficus._   The Figge tree.


The Figge trees that are noursed vp in our country are of three sorts,
whereof two are high; the one bearing against a wall goodly sweete
and delicate Figs, called Figs of Algarua, and is blewish when it is
ripe: the other tall kinde is nothing so good, neither doth beare ripe
Figges so kindly and well, and peraduenture may be the white ordinary
kinde that commeth from Spaine. The third is a dwarfe kinde of Figge
tree, not growing much higher then to a mans body or shoulders, bearing
excellent good Figges and blew, but not so large as the first kinde.

The Figge trees of all these three kindes are in leaues and growing
one like vnto another, sauing for their height, colour, and sweetnesse
of the fruit, hauing many armes or branches, hollow or pithy in the
middle, bearing large leaues, and somewhat thicke, diuided sometimes
into three, but vsually into fiue sections, of a darke greene colour
on the vpperside, and whitish vnderneath, yeelding a milkie iuyce
when it is broken, as the branches also or the figges when they are
greene: the fruit breaketh out from the branches without anie blossome,
contrary to all other trees of our Orchard, being round and long,
fashioned very like vnto a small Peare, full of small white grains or
kernels within it, of a very sweete taste when it is ripe, and very
mellow or soft, that it can hardly be carried farre without bruising.

The other two sorts you may easily know and vnderstand, by so much as
hath been said of them. Take only this more of the Figge tree, That if
you plant it not against a bricke wall, or the wall of an house, &c. it
will not ripen so kindly. The dwarfe Figge tree is more tender, and is
therefore planted in great square tubs, to be remoued into the sunne in
the Summer time, and into the house in Winter.


        The Vse of Figges.

        Figges are serued to the table with Raysins of the Sunne, and
        blanched Almonds, for a Lenten dish.

        The Figs that growe with vs when they are ripe, and fresh
        gathered, are eaten of diuers with a little salt and pepper, as
        a dainty banquet to entertaine a friend, which seldome passeth
        without a cup of wine to wash them downe.

        In Italy (as I haue beene enformed by diuers Gentlemen that
        haue liued there to study physicke) they eate them in the same
        manner, but dare not eate many for feare of a feuer to follow,
        they doe account them to be such breeders of bloud, and heaters
        of it likewise.

        The Figges that are brought vs from Spaine, are vsed to make
        Ptisan drinkes, and diuers other things, that are giuen them
        that haue coughes or colds.

        It is one of the ingredients also with Nuts and Rue, into
        Mithridates counterpoison.

        The small Figges that growe with vs, and will not ripen, are
        preserued by the Comfitmakers, and candid also, to serue as
        other moist or candid banquetting stuffe.




CHAP. VIII.

_Sorbus._   The Seruice tree.


There are two kindes of Seruice trees that are planted in Orchards
with vs, and there is also a wilde kinde like vnto the later of them,
with Ashen leaues, found in the woods growing of it selfe, whose fruit
is not gathered, nor vsed to bee eaten of any but birds. And there is
another kinde also growing wilde abroad in many places, taken by the
Country people where it groweth, to be a Seruice tree, and is called in
Latine, _Aria Theophrasti_, whose leaues are large, somewhat like Nut
tree leaues, but greene aboue, and grayish vnderneath: some doe vse the
fruit as Seruices, and for the same purposes to good effect, yet both
of these wilde kindes wee leaue for another worke, and here declare
vnto you onely those two sorts are noursed vp in our Orchards.

The more common or ordinary Seruice tree with vs, is a reasonable
great tree, couered with a smooth barke, spread into many great armes,
whereon are set large leaues, very much cut in on the edges, almost
like vnto a Vine leafe, or rather like vnto that kinde of Maple, that
is vsually called the Sycomore tree with vs: the flowers are white, and
growe many clustering together, which after bring forth small browne
berries when they are ripe, of the bignesse almost of Hasell nuts, with
a small tuft, as if it were a crowne on the head, wherein are small
blacke kernels.

The other kinde, which is more rare with vs, and brought into this Land
by Iohn Tradescante, heretofore often remembered, hath diuers winged
leaues, many set together like vnto an Ashen leafe, but smaller, and
euery one endented about the edges: the flowers growe in long clusters,
but nothing so many, or so close set as the wilde kinde: the fruit
of this tree is in some round like an Apple, and in others a little
longer like a Peare, but of a more pleasant taste then the ordinarie
kinde, when they are ripe and mellowed, as they vse to doe with both
these kindes, and with Medlars.


        The Vse of Seruices.

        They are gathered when they growe to be neare ripe (and that
        is neuer before they haue felt some frosts) and being tyed
        together, are either hung vp in some warme roome, to ripen them
        thoroughly, that they may bee eaten, or (as some vse to doe)
        lay them in strawe, chaffe, or branne, to ripen them.

        They are binding, fit to be taken of them that haue any
        scouring or laske, to helpe to stay the fluxe; but take heed,
        lest if you binde too much, more paine and danger may come
        thereof then of the scouring.




CHAP. IX.

_Mespilus._   The Medlar tree.


There are three sorts of Medlars: The greater and the lesser English,
and the Neapolitan.

The great and the small English Medlar differ not one from the other
in any thing, but in the size of the fruit, except that the small
kinde hath some prickes or thornes vpon it, which the great one hath
not, bearing diuers boughes or armes, from whence breake forth diuers
branches, whereon are set long and somewhat narrow leaues, many
standing together; in the middle whereof, at the end of the branch,
commeth the flower, which is great and white, made of fiue leaues,
broad at the ends, with a nicke in the middle of euery one; after which
commeth the fruit, being round, and of a pale brownish colour, bearing
a crowne of those small leaues at the toppe, which were the huske of
the flower before, the middle thereof being somewhat hollow, and is
harsh, able to choake any that shall eate it before it be made mellow,
wherein there are certaine flat and hard kernels.

The Medlar of Naples groweth likewise to bee a reasonable great tree,
spreading forth armes and branches, whereon are set many gashed leaues,
somewhat like vnto Hawthorne leaues, but greater, and likewise diuers
thornes in many places: the flowers are of an herbie greene colour,
and small, which turne into smaller fruit then the former, and rounder
also, but with a small head or crowne at the toppe like vnto it, and is
of a more sweete and pleasant taste then the other, with three seeds
only therein ordinarily.


        The Vse of Medlars.

        Medlars are vsed in the same manner that Seruices are, that
        is, to be eaten when they are mellowed, and are for the same
        purposes to binde the body when there is a cause: yet they as
        well as the Seruices, are often eaten by them that haue no
        neede of binding, and but onely for the pleasant sweetnesse of
        them when they are made mellow, and sometimes come as a dish of
        ripe fruit at their fit season, to be serued with other sorts
        to the table.

_Lotus._   The Lote or Nettle tree.


[Illustration:

   6 _Lotus Virginiana._ The Pishamin or Virginia Plumme.
   7 _Cornus mas._ The Cornell Cherry tree.
]


The first kinde of Lote tree, whereof Dioscorides maketh mention,
is but of one kinde; but there are some other trees spoken of
by Theophrastus, that may be referred thereunto, which may bee
accounted as bastard kindes thereof, of which I meane to entreate in
this Chapter, hauing giuen you before the description of another
kinde hereof (by the opinion of good Authors) vnder the name of
_Laurocerasus_.

The first or true Lote tree groweth to be a tree of a great height,
whose bodie and elder branches are couered with a smooth darke greene
barke, the leaues are somewhat rough in handling, of a darke greene
colour, long pointed, and somewhat deepe dented about the edges,
somewhat like vnto a Nettle leafe, and oftentimes growe yellow toward
Autumne: the flowers stand here and there scattered vpon the branches,
after which come round berries like vnto Cherries, hanging downewards
vpon long footstalkes, greene at the first, and whitish afterwards; but
when they are ripe they become reddish, and if they be suffered to hang
too long on the branches, they grow blackish, of a pleasant austere
taste, not to be misliked, wherein is a hard round stone.

The second, which is a bastard kinde, and called _Guaiacum Patauinum_,
groweth to bee a faire tree, with a smooth darke greene barke, shooting
out many faire great boughes, and also slender greene branches, beset
with faire broad greene leaues, almost like vnto the leaues of the
Cornell tree, but larger: the flowers growe along the branches close
vnto them, without any or with a very short foote-stalke consisting
of foure greene leaues, which are as the huske, containing within it
a purplish flower, made of foure leaues somewhat reddish: the fruit
standeth in the middle of the green huske, greene at the first, and
very harsh, but red and round when it is ripe, and somewhat like a
Plumme, with a small point or pricke at the head thereof, and of a
reasonable pleasant taste or rellish, wherein are contained flat and
thicke browne seeds or kernels, like vnto the kernels of _Cassia
Fistula_, somewhat hard, and not so stonie, but that it may somewhat
easily be cut with a knife.

The third is called in Virginia _Pishamin_, The Virginia Plumme (if it
be not all one with the former Guaiacana, whereof I am more then halfe
perswaded) hath growne with vs of the kernels that were sent out of
Virginia, into great trees, whose wood is very hard and brittle, and
somewhat white withall: the branches are many, and grow slender to the
end, couered with a very thinne greenish bark, whereon doe grow many
faire broad greene leaues, without dent or notch on the edges, and so
like vnto the former _Guaiacum_, that I verily thinke it (as I before
said) to bee the same. It hath not yet borne flower or fruit in our
Countrey that I can vnderstand: but the fruit, as it was sent to vs, is
in forme and bignesse like vnto a Date, couered with a blackish skinne,
set in a huske of foure hard leaues, very firme like vnto a Date, and
almost as sweete, with great flat and thicke kernels within them, very
like vnto the former, but larger.


        The Vse of these Lote trees.

        The first sort is eaten as an helper to coole and binde the
        body: the last, as Captaine Smith relateth in the discouery
        of Virginia, if the fruit be eaten while it is greene, and
        not ripe, is able by the harsh and binding taste and quality
        to draw ones mouth awry (euen as it is said of the former
        Guaiacana) but when it is thorough ripe it is pleasant, as I
        said before.




CHAP. XI.

_Cornus mas._   The Cornell tree.


The Cornell tree that is planted in Orchards, being the male (for the
female is an hedge bush) is of two sorts, the one bearing red, the
other whiter berries, which is very rare yet in our country, and not
differing else.

It groweth to a reasonable bignesse and height, yet neuer to any great
tree, the wood whereof is very hard, like vnto horne, and thereof it
obtained the name: the body and branches are couered with a rugged
barke, and spreadeth reasonable well, hauing somewhat smooth leaues,
full of veines, plaine, and not dented on the edges: the flowers are
many small yellow tufts, as it were of short haires or threads set
together, which come forth before any leafe, and fall away likewise
before any leafe bee much open: the fruit are long and round berries,
of the bignesse of small Oliues, with an hard round stone within them,
like vnto an Oliue stone, and are of a yellowish red when they are
ripe, of a reasonable pleasant taste, yet somewhat austere withall.

The white (as I said) is like vnto the red, but onely that his fruit is
more white when it is ripe.


        The Vse of the Cornelles.

        They helpe to binde the body, and to stay laskes, and by reason
        of the pleasantnesse in them when they are ripe, they are much
        desired.

        They are also preserued and eaten, both for rarity and delight,
        and for the purpose aforesaid.




CHAP. XII.

_Cerasus._   The Cherry tree.


There are so many varieties and differences of Cherries, that I know
not well how to expresse them vnto you, without a large relation of
their seuerall formes. I will therefore endeauour after one generall
description (as my custome is in many other the like variable fruits)
to giue as briefe and short notes vpon all the rest, as I can both for
leafe and fruit, that so you may the better know what the fruit is,
when you haue the name.

The English Cherrie tree groweth in time to be of a reasonable bignesse
and height, spreading great armes, and also small twiggy branches
plentifully; the leaues whereof are not verie large or long, but nicked
or dented about the edges: the flowers come forth two or three or foure
at the most together, at a knot or ioynt, euerie one by it selfe, vpon
his owne small and long footestalke, consisting of fiue white leaues,
with some threds in the middle; after which come round berries, greene
at the first, and red when they are through ripe, of a meane bignesse,
and of a pleasant sweete taste, somewhat tart withall, with a hard
white stone within it, whose kernell is somewhat bitter, but not
vnpleasant.

The Flanders Cherrie differeth not from the English, but that it is
somewhat larger, and the Cherry somewhat greater and sweeter, and not
so sower.

The early Flanders Cherry is more rathe or early ripe, almost as soone
as the May Cherry, especially planted against a wall, and of many false
knaues or Gardiners are sold for May Cherrie trees.

The May Cherrie in a standard beareth ripe fruite later then planted
against a wall, where the berries will be red in the verie beginning of
May sometimes.

The Arch-Dukes Cherrie is one of the fairest and best cherries wee
haue, being of a very red colour when it is ripe, and a little long
more then round, and somewhat pointed at the end, of the best rellish
of any Cherrie whatsoeuer, and of a firme substance; scarce one of
twentie of our Nurserie men doe sell the right, but giue one for
another: for it is an inherent qualitie almost hereditarie with most of
them, to sell any man an ordinary fruit for whatsoeuer rare fruit he
shall aske for: so little they are to be trusted.

The ounce Cherrie hath the greatest and broadest leafe of any other
cherrie, but beareth the smallest store of cherries euerie yeare that
any doth, and yet blossometh well: the fruit also is nothing answerable
to the name being not verie great, of a pale yellowish red, neere the
colour of Amber, and therefore some haue called it, the Amber Cherrie.

The great leafed Cherrie is thought of diuers to bee the Ounce Cherrie,
because it hath almost as great a leafe as the former: but the fruit of
this also doth not answer the expectation of so great a leafe, being
but of a meane bignesse, and a small bearer, yet of a pale reddish
colour.

The true Gascoign Cherry is known but to a few; for our Nursery men do
so change the names of most fruits they sell, that they deliuer but
very few true names to any: In former times before our wilde blacke
Cherrie was found to grow plentifully in our owne woods in many places
of this Land, the French continually stored vs with wilde stockes
to graft vpon, which then were called Gascoigne stocks, but since
they haue so termed another red Cherrie, and obtruded it vpon their
customers: but the true is one of our late ripe white Cherries, euen
as Gerard saith, it is a great cherrie and spotted: and this is that
Cherrie I so commend to be a fit stocke to graft May cherries vpon.

The Morello Cherrie is of a reasonable bignesse, of a darke red colour
when they are full ripe, and hang long on, of a sweetish sower taste,
the pulpe or substance is red, and somewhat firme: if they be dryed
they will haue a fine sharpe or sower taste very delectable.

The Hartlippe Cherrie is so called of the place where the best of this
kinde is noursed vp, being betweene Sittingbourne and Chattam in Kent,
and is the biggest of our English kindes.

The smaller Lacure or Hart Cherrie is a reasonable faire Cherrie, full
aboue, and a little pointing downward, after the fashion of an heart,
as it is vsually painted, blackish when it is full ripe, and lesser
then the next.

The great Lacure or Hart Cherrie differeth not in forme, but in
greatnesse, being vsually twice as great as the former, and of a
reddish blacke colour also: both of them are of a firme substance, and
reasonable sweete. Some doe call the white cherrie, the White hart
cherrie.

The Luke Wardes Cherrie hath a reasonable large leafe, and a larger
flower then many other: the cherries grow with long stalkes, and a
stone of a meane size within them, of a darke reddish colour when they
are full ripe, of a reasonable good rellish, and beareth well.

The Corone Cherrie hath a leafe little differing from the Luke Wardes
cherrie; the fruit when it is ripe, is of a faire deepe red colour, of
a good bignesse, and of a verie good taste, neither verie sweete or
sower: the pulpe or iuice will staine the hands.

The Vrinall Cherrie in a most fruitfull yeare is a small bearer, hauing
many yeares none, and the best but a few; yet doth blossome plentifully
euery yeare for the most part: the cherrie is long and round, like vnto
an Vrinall, from whence it tooke his name; reddish when it is full
ripe, and of an indifferent sweete rellish.

The Agriot Cherrie is but a small Cherrie, of a deepe redde colour when
it is ripe, which is late; of a fine sharpe taste, most pleasant and
wholsome to the stomacke of all other cherries, as well while they are
fresh as being dryed, which manner they much vse in France, and keepe
them for the vse both of the sicke and sound at all times.

The Biguarre Cherrie is a fair cherrie, much spotted with white spots
vpon the pale red berry, and sometimes discoloured halfe white and
halfe reddish, of a reasonable good rellish.

The Morocco Cherrie hath a large white blossome, and an indifferent big
berrie, long and round, with a long stalke of a darke reddish purple
colour, a little tending to a blew when it is full ripe, of a firme
substance: the iuice is of a blackish red, discolouring the hands
or lips, and of a pleasant taste: Some doe thinke that this and the
Morello be both one.

The Naples Cherrie is also thought to bee all one with the Morello or
Morocco.

The white Spanish Cherrie is an indifferent good bearer, the leafe and
blossome somewhat large, and like the Luke Wardes cherrie: the cherries
are reasonable faire berries, with long stalkes and great stones,
white on the outside, with some rednesse, on the one side of a firme
substance, and reasonable sweet, but with a little aciditie, and is one
of the late ripe ones: But there is another late ripe white Cherry,
which some call the Gascoigne, before remembred.

The Flanders cluster Cherrie is of two sorts, one greater then another:
the greater kinde hath an indifferent large leafe; the blossomes haue
many threds within them, shewing as it were many parts, which after
turne into clusters of berries, foure, fiue or sixe together, and but
with one stalke vnder them, as if they grew one out of another, and
sometimes they will beare but two or three, and most of them but one
cherry on a stalke, which are red when they are ripe, very tender, and
waterish sweete in eating.

The lesser is in all things like the greater, but smaller, which maketh
the difference.

The wilde cluster or birds cluster Cherry beareth many blossomes set
all along the stalkes, and cherries after them in the same maner, like
a long thinne bunch of grapes, and therefore called of some the Grape
cherry: there are of them both red and blacke.

]


The soft sheld Cherrie is a small red cherrie when it is ripe, hauing
the stone within it so soft and tender, that it may easily be broken in
the eating of the cherrie.

Iohn Tradescantes Cherrie is most vsually sold by our Nursery
Gardiners, for the Archdukes cherrie, because they haue more plenty
thereof, and will better be increased, and because it is so faire and
good a cherrie that it may be obtruded without much discontent: it is
a reasonable good bearer, a faire great berrie, deepe coloured, and a
little pointed.

The Baccalaos or New-found-land Cherrie hath a shining long leafe,
most like vnto a Peach leafe, the blossomes come very many together as
it were in an vmbell, which is such a cluster as is neither like the
Flanders cluster, nor the wilde cluster cherrie blossome: it bringeth
forth berries standing in the same manner euerie one vpon his own
footestalke, being no bigger then the largest berrie of the red Curran
tree or bush, of a pale or waterish red colour when it is ripe.

The strange long cluster Cherrie, or _Padus Theophrasti Dalechampio_
is reckoned by the Author of that great Herball that goeth vnder his
name, among the sorts of cherries; and so must I vntill a fitter place
be found for it. It groweth in time to be a great tree, with a sad
coloured barke both on the bodie and branches, whereon doe grow many
leaues, somewhat broade, shorter, harder, and a little more crumpled
then any cherrie leafe: the blossomes are very small, and of a pale or
whitish colour, smelling very sweete and strong, or rather heady, like
Orenge flowers, growing on small long branches, very like the toppe of
flowers vpon the Laburnum or Beane trefoile trees: after which come
small blacke berries, growing together all along the long stalke, like
vnto the wilde cluster or birds cherrie mentioned before, but not much
bigger then tares, with small stones within them, and little or no
sustance vpon them: the French call the tree _Putier_, because the wood
thereof stinketh, and make it to be wonderfull that the blossomes of
the tree mould be so sweete, and the wood so stinking.

The Cullen Cherrie is a darke red cherrie like the Agriot, which they
of those parts neere Cullen and Vtrecht &c. vse to put into their
drinke, to giue it the deeper colour.

The great Hungarian Cherrie of Zwerts is like both in leafe and fruite
vnto the Morello cherrie, but much greater and fairer, and a far
better bearer: for from a small branch hath beene gathered a pound of
cherries, and this is vsuall continually, and not accidentally, most
of them foure inches in compasse about, and very many of them more of
a faire deepe red colour, and very sweete, excelling the Arch-Dukes
cherry, or any other whatsoeuer.

The Cameleon or strange changeable Cherry deseruedly hath this name,
although of mine owne imposition, not only because it beareth vsually
both blossomes, greene and ripe fruit at one time thereupon, but that
the fruit will be of many formes; some round, some as it were square,
and some bunched forth on one side or another, abiding constant in no
fashion, but for the most part shewing forth all these diuersities
euerie yeare growing vpon it: the fruit is of a very red colour, and
good taste.

The great Rose Cherry, or double blossomd Cherry differeth not in any
thing from the English Cherrie, but only in the blossomes, which are
very thicke of white leaues, as great and double as the double white
Crowfoote, before remembred, and sometimes out of the middle of them
will spring another smaller flower, but double also; this seldome
beareth fruit, but when it doth I suppose it commeth from those
blossomes are the least double, and is red, no bigger then our ordinary
English cherrie.

The lesser Rose or double blossomd Cherrie beareth double flowers also,
but not so thicke and double as the former; but beareth fruit more
plentifully, of the same colour and bignesse with the former.

The Dwarfe Cherrie is of two sorts; one whose branches fall downe low,
round about the body of it, with small greene leaues, and fruit as
small, of a deep red colour.

The other, whose branches, although small, grow more vpright, hauing
greener shining leaues: the fruit is little bigger then the former, red
also when it is ripe, with a litle point at the end: both of them of a
sweetish rellish, but more sower.

The great bearing Cherry of Master Millen is a reasonable great red
cherry, bearing very plentifully, although it bee planted against a
North wall, yet it will bee late ripe, but of an indifferent sweet and
good rellish.

The long finger Cherry is another small long red one, being long &
round like a finger, wherof it took the name: this is not the Vrinall
cherry before, but differing from it.


        The Vse of Cherries.

        All these sorts of Cherries serue wholly to please the palate,
        and are eaten at all times, both before and after meales.

        All Cherries are cold, yet the sower more then the sweete; and
        although the sweete doe most please, yet the sower are more
        wholsome, if there bee regard taken in the vsing.

        The Agriot or sower Cherries are in France much vsed to bee
        dryed (as is said before) as Pruines are, and so serue to be
        ministred to the sicke in all hot diseases, as feuers &c.
        being both boyled in their drinkes, and taken now and then of
        themselues, which by reason of their tartnesse, doe please the
        stomacke passing well.

        The Gum of the Cherrie tree is commended to bee good for those
        are troubled with the grauell or stone. It is also good for the
        cough being dissolued in liquour, and stirreth vp an appetite.
        The distilled water of the blacke Cherries, the stones being
        broken among them, is vsed for the same purpose, for the
        grauell, stone, and winde.




CHAP. XIII.

_Prunus._   The Plumme tree.


There are many more varieties of Plummes then of Cherries, so that I
must follow the same order with these that I did with them, euen giue
you their names apart, with briefe notes vpon them, and one description
to serue for all the rest. And in this recitall I shall leaue out
the Apricockes which are certainly a kind of Plum, of an especiall
difference, and not of a Peach, as Galen and some others haue thought,
and set them in a chapter by themselues, and only in this set down
those fruits are vsually called Plums.

The Plum tree (especially diuers of them) riseth in time to bee a
reasonable tall and great tree, whose bodie and greater armes are
couered with a more rugged barke, yet in some more or lesse, the
younger branches being smooth in all, the leaues are somewhat rounder
then those of the Cherrie tree, and much differing among themselues,
some being longer, or larger, or rounder then others, and many that are
exercised herein, can tell by the leafe what Plum the tree beareth (I
speake this of many, not of all) as in many Cherries they can doe the
like: the flowers are white, consisting of fiue leaues: the fruit is
as variable in forme, as in taste or colour, some being ovall or Peare
fashion or Almond like, or sphericall or round, some firme, some soft
and waterish, some sweete, some sower or harsh, or differing from all
these tastes: and some white, others blacke, some red, others yellow,
some purple, others blew, as they shall bee briefly set downe vnto you
in the following lines, where I meane not to insert any the wilde or
hedge fruit, but those only are fit for an Orchard, to be stored with
good fruit: and of all which sorts, the choysest for goodnesse, and
rarest for knowledge, are to be had of my very good friend Master Iohn
Tradescante, who hath wonderfully laboured to obtaine all the rarest
fruits hee can heare off in any place of Christendome, Turky, yea or
the whole world; as also with Master Iohn Millen, dwelling in Olde
streete, who from Iohn Tradescante and all others that haue had good
fruit, hath stored himselfe with the best only, and he can sufficiently
furnish any.

The Amber Primordian Plumme is an indifferent faire Plumme, early ripe,
of a pale yellowish colour, and of a waterish taste, not pleasing.

The red Primordian Plumme is of a reasonable size, long and round,
reddish on the outside, of a more dry taste, and ripe with the first
sorts in the beginning of August.

The blew Primordian is a small plumme, almost like the Damascene, and
is subiect to drop off from the tree before it be ripe.

The white Date Plum is no very good plum.

The red Date plumme is a great long red pointed plumme, and late ripe,
little better then the white.

The blacke Mussell plumme is a good plumme, reasonable drye, and
tasteth well.

The red Mussell Plumme is somewhat flat as well as round, of a very
good taste, and is ripe about the middle of August.

The white Mussell plumme is like the redde, but somewhat smaller, and
of a whitish greene colour, but not so well tasted.

The Imperiall plum is a great long reddish plum, very waterish, and
ripeneth somewhat late.

The Gaunt plum is a great round reddish plum, ripe somewhat late, and
eateth waterish.

The red Pescod plum is a reasonable good plum.

The white Pescod plum is a reasonable good rellished plumme, but
somewhat waterish.

The greene Pescod plum is a reasonable big and long pointed plum, and
ripe in the beginning of September.

The Orenge plum is a yellowish plum, moist, and somewhat sweetish.

The Morocco plumme is blacke like a Damson, well tasted, and somewhat
drye in eating.

The Dine plum is a late ripe plum, great and whitish, speckled all ouer.

The Turkie plum is a large long blackish plum, and somewhat flat like
the Mussell plum, a well rellished dry plum.

The Nutmeg plumme is no bigger then a Damson, and is of a greenish
yellow colour when it is ripe, which is with vs about Bartholmew tide,
and is a good plum.

The Perdigon plumme is a dainty good plumme, early blackish, and well
rellished.

The Verdoch plum is a great fine greene shining plum fit to preserue.

The Ienua plum is the white Date plum, before remembred.

The Barberry plum is a great early blacke plum, and well tasted.

The Pruneola plum is a small white plum, of a fine tart taste: it was
wont to bee vsually brought ouer in small round boxes, and sold most
commonly at the Comfitmakers, (cut in twaine, the stone cast away) at a
very deere rate: the tree groweth and beareth well with vs.

The Shepway Bulleis is of a darke blewish brown colour, of a larger
size then the ordinary, and of a sharpe taste, but not so good as the
common.

The white and the blacke Bulleis are common in most Countries, being
small round plums, lesser then Damsons, sharper in taste, and later
ripe.

The Flushing Bulleis groweth with his fruite thicke clustring together
like grapes.

The Winter Creke is the latest ripe plum of all sorts, it groweth
plentifully about Bishops Hatfield.

The white Peare plum early ripe, is of a pale yellowish greene colour.

The late ripe white Peare plum is a greater and longer plum, greenish
white, and is not ripe vntill it be neere the end of September, both
waterish plums.

The blacke Peare plum is like vnto the white Peare plumme, but that the
colour is blackish when it is ripe, and is of a very good relish, more
firme and drye then the other.

The red Peare plumme is of the same fashion and goodnesse, but is the
worst of the three.

The white Wheate plum is a waterish fulsome plum.

The red Wheate plum is like the other for taste.

The Bowie plum is flat and round, yet flatter on the one side then on
the other, which caused the name, and is a very good rellished blacke
plum.

The Friars plumme is a very good plum, well tasted, and comming cleane
from the stone, being blacke when it is ripe, and some whitish spots
vpon it.

The Catalonia plum is a very good plum.

The Don Alteza is also a very good plum.

The Muscadine plum, some call the Queene mother plumme, and some the
Cherry plum, is a faire red plum, of a reasonable bignesse, and ripe
about Bartholmew tide.

The Christian plum, called also the Nutmeg plum; the tree groweth very
shrubby, and will abide good for six weekes at the least after it is
gathered, and after all other plums are spent.

The Cherry plum remembred before, speaking of the Muscadine plum, is a
very good plum, but small.

The Amber plum is a round plum, as yellow on the outside almost as
yellow waxe, of a sowre vnpleasant taste that which I tasted, but I
thinke it was not the right; for I haue seene and tasted another of the
same bignesse, of a paler colour, farre better rellished, and a firmer
substance, comming cleane from the stone like an Apricocke.

The Apricocke plum is a good plum when it is in its perfection, but
that is seldome; for it doth most vsually cracke, thereby diminishing
much of its goodnesse, and besides yeeldeth gumme at the crackes.

The Eason plum is a little red plum, but very good in taste.

The Violet plum is a small and long blackish blew plum, ripe about
Bartholmew tide, a very good dry eating fruit.

The Grape plum is the Flushing Bulleis before remembred.

The Dennie plum is called also the Cheston, or the Friars plum before
remembred.

The Damaske Violet plum, or Queen mother plum spoken of before.

The blacke Damascene plum is a very good dry plum, and of a darke blew
colour when it is ripe.

The white Damson is nothing so well rellished as the other.

The great Damson or Damaske plum is greater then the ordinary Damson,
and sweeter in taste.

The blew Damson well knowne, a good fruit.

The Coserers plum is flat, like vnto a Peare plum, it is early ripe and
blacke, of a very good rellish.

The Margate plum the worst of an hundred.

The green Oysterly plum is a reasonable great plum, of a whitish green
colour when it is ripe, of a moist and sweete taste, reasonable good.

The red Mirobalane plum groweth to be a great tree quickly, spreading
very thicke and farre, very like the blacke Thorne or Sloe bush: the
fruit is red, earlier ripe, and of a better taste then the white.

The white Mirobalane plum is in most things like the former red, but
the fruit is of a whitish yellow colour, and very pleasant, especially
if it be not ouer ripe: both these had need to be plashed against a
wall, or else they will hardly beare ripe fruit.

The Oliue plum is very like a greene Oliue, but for colour and
bignesse, and groweth lowe on a small bushing tree, and ripeneth late,
but is the best of all the sorts of greene plums.

The white diapred plum of Malta, scarce knowne to any in our Land
but Iohn Tradescante, is a very good plum, and striped all ouer like
diaper, and thereby so called.

The blacke diapred plum is like the Damascene plum, being blacke with
spots, as small as pins points vpon it, of a very good rellish.

The Peake plum is a long whitish plum, and very good.

The Pishamin or Virginia plum is called a plum, but vtterly differeth
from all sorts of plums, the description whereof may truely enforme
you, as it is set downe in the tenth Chapter going before, whereunto I
referre you.


        The Vse of Plums.

        The great Damaske or Damson Plummes are dryed in France in
        great quantities, and brought ouer vnto vs in Hogs-heads, and
        other great vessels, and are those Prunes that are vsually sold
        at the Grocers, vnder the name of Damaske Prunes: the blacke
        Bulleis also are those (being dryed in the same manner) that
        they call French Prunes, and by their tartnesse are thought to
        binde, as the other, being sweet, to loosen the body.

        The Bruneola Plumme, by reason of his pleasant tartnesse, is
        much accounted of, and being dryed, the stones taken from them,
        are brought ouer to vs in small boxes, and sold deere at the
        Comfitmakers, where they very often accompany all sorts of
        banquetting stuffes.

        Some of these Plums, because of their firmnesse, are
        vndoubtedly more wholsome then others that are sweete and
        waterish, and cause lesse offence in their stomackes that eate
        them; and therefore are preserued with Sugar, to be kept all
        the yeare. None of them all is vsed in medicines so much as
        the great Damson or Damaske Prune, although all of them for
        the most part doe coole, lenifie, and draw forth choller, and
        thereby are fittest to be vsed of such as haue chollericke
        Agues.




CHAP. XIIII.

_Mala Armeniaca siue Præcocia._   Apricockes.


The Apricocke (as I said) is without question a kinde of Plumme, rather
then a Peach, both the flower being white, and the stone of the fruit
smooth also, like a Plumme, and yet because of the excellencie of
the fruit, and the difference therein from all other Plummes, I haue
thought it meete to entreate thereof by it selfe, and shew you the
varieties haue been obserued in these times.

The Apricocke tree riseth vp to a very great height, either standing
by it selfe (where it beareth not so kindly, and very little in our
country) or planted against a wall, as it is most vsuall, hauing a
great stemme or body, and likewise many great armes or branches,
couered with a smooth barke: the leaues are large, broad, and almost
round, but pointed at the ends, and finely dented about the edges:
the flowers are white, as the Plumme tree blossomes, but somewhat
larger, and rounder set: the fruit is round, with a cleft on the one
side, somewhat like vnto a Peach, being of a yellowish colour as well
on the inside as outside, of a firme or fast substance, and dry, not
ouermoist in the eating, and very pleasant in taste, containing within
it a broad and flat stone, somewhat round and smooth, not rugged as the
Peach stone, with a pleasant sweete kernell (yet some haue reported,
that there is such as haue their kernels bitter, which I did neuer see
or know) and is ripe almost with our first or earliest Plummes, and
thereof it tooke the name of _Præcox_; and it may bee was the earliest
of all others was then knowne, when that name was giuen.

The great Apricocke, which some call the long Apricocke, is the
greatest and fairest of all the rest.

The smaller Apricocke, which some call the small round Apricocke, is
thought to be small, because it first sprang from a stone: but that
is not so; for the kinde it selfe being inoculated, will bee alwaies
small, and neuer halfe so faire and great as the former.

The white Apricocke hath his leaues more folded together, as if it were
halfe double: it beareth but seldome, and very few, which differ not
from the ordinary, but in being more white, without any red when it is
ripe.

The Mascoline Apricocke hath a finer greene leafe, and thinner then the
former, and beareth very seldome any store of fruit, which differeth in
nothing from the first, but that it is a little more delicate.

The long Mascoline Apricocke hath his fruit growing a little longer
then the former, and differeth in nothing else.

The Argier Apricocke is a smaller fruit then any of the other, and
yellow, but as sweete and delicate as any of them, hauing a blackish
stone within it, little bigger then a Lacure Cherry stone: this with
many other sorts Iohn Tradescante brought with him returning from the
Argier voyage, whither hee went voluntary with the Fleete, that went
against the Pyrates in the yeare 1620.


        The Vse of Apricockes.

        Apricockes are eaten oftentimes in the same manner that other
        dainty Plummes are, betweene meales of themselues, or among
        other fruit at banquets.

        They are also preserued and candid, as it pleaseth Gentlewomen
        to bestowe their time and charge, or the Comfitmaker to sort
        among other candid fruits.

        Some likewise dry them, like vnto Peares, Apples, Damsons, and
        other Plummes.

        Matthiolus doth wonderfully commend the oyle drawne from the
        kernels of the stones, to annoint the inflamed _hæmorrhoides_
        or piles, the swellings of vlcers, the roughnesse of the tongue
        and throate, and likewise the paines of the eares.




CHAP. XV.

_Mala Persica._   Peaches.


As I ordered the Cherries and Plummes, so I intend to deale with
Peaches, because their varieties are many, and more knowne in these
dayes then in former times: but because the Nectorin is a differing
kinde of Peach, I must deale with it as I did with the Apricocke among
the Plummes, that is, place it in a Chapter by it selfe.

The Peach tree of it selfe groweth not vsually altogether so great, or
high as the Apricocke, because it is lesse durable, but yet spreadeth
with faire great branches, from whence spring smaller and slenderer
reddish twigges, whereon are set long narrow greene leaues, dented
about the edges: the blossomes are greater then of any Plumme, of a
deepe blush or light purple colour: after which commeth the fruit,
which is round, and sometimes as great as a reasonable Apple or Pippin
(I speake of some sorts; for there be some kindes that are much
smaller) with a furrow or cleft on the one side, and couered with a
freese or cotton on the outside, of colour either russet, or red,
or yellow, or of a blackish red colour; of differing substances and
tastes also, some being firme, others waterish, some cleauing fast to
the stone on the inside, others parting from it more or lesse easily,
one excelling another very farre, wherein is contained a rugged stone,
with many chinkes or clefts in it, the kernell whereof is bitter: the
roots growe neither deepe nor farre; and therefore are subiect to the
winds, standing alone, and not against a wall. It sooner waxeth old and
decayeth, being sprung of a stone, then being inoculated on a Plumme
stocke, whereby it is more durable.

The great white Peach is white on the outside as the meate is also, and
is a good well rellished fruit.

The small white Peach is all one with the greater, but differeth in
size.

The Carnation Peach is of three sorts, two are round, and the third
long; they are all of a whitish colour, shadowed ouer with red, and
more red on the side is next the sunne: the lesser round is the more
common, and the later ripe.

The grand Carnation Peach is like the former round Peach, but greater,
and is as late ripe, that is, in the beginning of September.

The red Peach is an exceeding well rellished fruit.

The russet Peach is one of the most ordinary Peaches in the Kingdome,
being of a russet colour on the outside, and but of a reasonable
rellish, farre meaner then many other.

The Island Peach is a faire Peach, and of a very good rellish.

The Newington Peach is a very good Peach, and of an excellent good
rellish, being of a whitish greene colour on the outside, yet halfe
reddish, and is ripe about Bartholmew tide.

The yellow Peach is of a deepe yellow colour; there be hereof diuers
sorts, some good and some bad.

The St. Iames Peach is the same with the Queenes Peach, here belowe set
downe, although some would make them differing.

The Melocotone Peach is a yellow faire Peach, but differing from the
former yellow both in forme and taste, in that this hath a small
crooked end or point for the most part, it is ripe before them, and
better rellished then any of them.

The Peach _du Troas_ is a long and great whitish yellow Peach, red on
the outside, early ripe, and is another kinde of Nutmeg Peach.

The Queenes Peach is a faire great yellowish browne Peach, shadowed as
it were ouer with deepe red, and is ripe at Bartholmew tide, of a very
pleasant good taste.

The Romane Peach is a very good Peach, and well rellished.

The Durasme or Spanish Peach is of a darke yellowish red colour on the
outside, and white within.

The blacke Peach is a great large Peach, of a very darke browne colour
on the outside, it is of a waterish taste, and late ripe.

The Alberza Peach is late ripe, and of a reasonable good taste.

The Almond Peach, so called, because the kernell of the stone is
sweete, like the Almond, and the fruit also somewhat pointed like the
Almond in the huske; it is early ripe, and like the Newington Peach,
but lesser.

The Man Peach is of two sorts, the one longer then the other, both of
them are good Peaches, but the shorter is the better rellished.

The Cherry Peach is a small Peach, but well tasted.

The Nutmeg Peach is of two sorts, one that will be hard when it is
ripe, and eateth not so pleasantly as the other, which will bee soft
and mellow; they are both small Peaches, hauing very little or no
resemblance at all to a Nutmeg, except in being a little longer then
round, and are early ripe.

Many other sorts of Peaches there are, whereunto wee can giue no
especiall name; and therefore I passe them ouer in silence.


        The Vse of Peaches.

        Those Peaches that are very moist and waterish (as many of
        them are) and not firme, doe soone putrefie in the stomacke,
        causing surfeits oftentimes; and therefore euery one had neede
        bee carefull, what and in what manner they eate them: yet they
        are much and often well accepted with all the Gentry of the
        Kingdome.

        The leaues, because of their bitternesse, serue well being
        boyled in Ale or Milke, to be giuen vnto children that haue
        wormes, to help to kill them, and doe gently open the belly, if
        there be a sufficient quantity vsed.

        The flowers haue the like operation, that is, to purge the body
        somewhat more forceably then Damaske Roses; a Syrupe therefore
        made of the flowers is very good.

        The kernels of the Peach stones are oftentimes vsed to be giuen
        to them that cannot well make water, or are troubled with the
        stone; for it openeth the stoppings of the vritory passages,
        whereby much ease ensueth.




CHAP. XVI.

_Nucipersica._   Nectorins.


I presume that the name _Nucipersica_ doth most rightly belong vnto
that kinde of Peach, which we call Nectorins, and although they haue
beene with vs not many yeares, yet haue they beene knowne both in Italy
to Matthiolus, and others before him, who it seemeth knew no other
then the yellow Nectorin, as Dalechampius also: But we at this day doe
know fiue seuerall sorts of Nectorins, as they shall be presently set
downe; and as in the former fruits, so in this, I will giue you the
description of one, and briefe notes of the rest.

The Nectorin is a tree of no great bignesse, most vsually lesser then
the Peach tree, his body and elder boughes being whitish, the younger
branches very red, whereon grow narrow long greene leaues, so like
vnto Peach leaues, that none can well distinguish them, vnlesse it be
in this, that they are somewhat lesser; the blossomes are all reddish,
as the Peach, but one of a differing fashion from all the other, as I
shall shew you by and by: the fruit that followeth is smaller, rounder,
and smoother then Peaches, without any cleft on the side, and without
any douny cotton or freeze at all; and herein is like vnto the outer
greene rinde of the Wallnut, whereof as I am perswaded it tooke the
name, of a fast and firme meate, and very delicate in taste, especially
the best kindes, with a rugged stone within it, and a bitter kernell.

The Muske Nectorin, so called, because it being a kinde of the best red
Nectorins, both smelleth and eateth as if the fruit were steeped in
Muske: some thinke that this and the next Romane Nectorin are all one.

The Romane red Nectorin, or cluster Nectorin, hath a large or great
purplish blossome, like vnto a Peach, reddish at the bottome on the
outside, and greenish within: the fruit is of a fine red colour on the
outside, and groweth in clusters, two or three at a ioynt together, of
an excellent good taste.

The bastard red Nectorin hath a smaller or pincking blossome, more
like threads then leaues, neither so large nor open as the former, and
yellowish within at the bottome: the fruit is red on the outside, and
groweth neuer but one at a ioynt; it is a good fruit, but eateth a
little more rawish then the other, euen when it is full ripe.

The yellow Nectorin is of two sorts, the one an excellent fruit,
mellow, and of a very good rellish; the other hard, and no way
comparable to it.

The greene Nectorin, great and small; for such I haue seene abiding
constant, although both planted in one ground: they are both of one
goodnesse, and accounted with most to be the best rellished Nectorin of
all others.

The white Nectorin is said to bee differing from the other, in that it
will bee more white on the outside when it is ripe, then either the
yellow or greene: but I haue not yet seene it.


        The Vse of Nectorins.

        The fruit is more firme then the Peach, and more delectable in
        taste; and is therefore of more esteeme, and that worthily.




CHAP. XVII.

_Amygdala._   Almonds.


The Almond also may be reckoned vnto the stock or kindred of the
Peaches, it is so like both in leafe and blossome, and somewhat also in
the fruit, for the outward forme, although it hath onely a dry skinne,
and no pulpe or meate to bee eaten: but the kernell of the stone or
shell, which is called the Almond, maketh recompense of that defect,
whereof some are sweete, some bitter, some great, some small, some
long, and some short.

The Almond tree groweth vpright, higher and greater then any Peach; and
is therefore vsually planted by it selfe, and not against a wall, whose
body sometime exceedeth any mans fadome, whereby it sheweth to be of
longer continuance, bearing large armes, and smaller branches also, but
brittle, whereon are set long and narrow leaues, like vnto the Peach
tree: the blossomes are purplish, like vnto Peach blossoms, but paler:
the fruit is somewhat like a Peach for the forme of the skinne or
outside, which is rough, but not with any such cleft therein, or with
any pulpe or meate fit to bee eaten, but is a thicke dry skinne when it
is ripe, couering the stone or shell, which is smooth and not rugged,
and is either long and great, or small, or thicke and short, according
as the nut or kernell within it is, which is sweete both in the greater
and smaller, and onely one smaller kinde which is bitter: yet this I
haue obserued, that all the Almond trees that I haue seene growe in
England, both of the sweete and bitter kindes, beare Almonds thicke and
short, and not long, as that sort which is called the Iorden Almond.


        The Vse of Almonds.

        They are vsed many ways, and for many purposes, either eaten
        alone with Figges, or Raysins of the Sunne, or made into paste
        with Sugar and Rosewater for Marchpanes, or put among Floure,
        Egges, and Sugar, to make Mackerons, or crusted ouer with
        Sugar, to make Comfits, or mixed with Rosewater and Sugar, to
        make Butter, or with Barley water, to make Milke, and many
        other waies, as euery one list, that hath skill in such things.

        The oyle also of Almonds is vsed many waies, both inwardly
        and outwardly, for many purposes; as the oyle of sweete
        Almonds mixt with poudered white Sugar Candy, for coughes and
        hoarsenesse, and to be drunk alone, or with some other thing
        (as the Syrupe of Marsh Mallowes) for the stone, to open and
        lenifie the passages, and make them slipperie, that the stone
        may passe the easier. And also for women in Child bed after
        their sore trauell. And outwardly either by it selfe, or with
        oyle of Tartar to make a creame, to lenifie the skin, parched
        with the winde or otherwise, or to annoint the stomacke either
        alone, or with other things to helpe a cold.

        The oyle of bitter Almonds is much vsed to be dropped into
        their eares that are hard of hearing, to helpe to open them.
        And as it is thought, doth more scoure and cleanse the skin
        then the sweet oyle doth, and is therefore more vsed of many
        for that purpose, as the Almonds themselues are.




CHAP. XVIII.

_Mala Arantia._   Orenges.


I bring here to your consideration, as you see, the Orenge tree
alone, without mentioning the Citron or Lemmon trees, in regard of
the experience we haue seen made of them in diuers places: For the
Orenge tree hath abiden with some extraordinary looking and tending of
it, when as neither of the other would by any meanes be preserued any
long time. If therefore any be desirous to keepe this tree, he must
so prouide for it, that it be preserued from any cold, either in the
winter or spring, and exposed to the comfort of the sunne in summer.
And for that purpose some keepe them in great square boxes, and lift
them to and fro by iron hooks on the sides, or cause them to be rowled
by trundels, or small wheels vnder them, to place them in an house, or
close gallerie for the winter time: others plant them against a bricke
wall in the ground, and defend them by a shed of boardes, couered ouer
with seare-cloth in the winter, and by the warmth of a stoue, or other
such thing, giue them some comfort in the colder times: but no tent or
meane prouision will preserue them.

The Orenge tree in the warme Countries groweth very high, but with vs
(or else it is a dwarfe kinde thereof) riseth not very high: the barke
of the elder stemmes being of a darke colour, and the young branches
very greene, whereon grow here and there some few thornes: the leaues
are faire, large, and very greene, in forme almost like a Bay leafe,
but that it hath a small eare, or peece of a leafe, fashioned like vnto
an heart vnder euery one of them, with many small holes to be seene in
them, if you hold them vp betweene you and the light, of a sweet but
strong smell, naturally not falling away, but alwaies abiding on, or
vntill new be come vp, bearing greene leaues continually: the flowers
are whitish, of a very strong and heady sent; after which come small
round fruit, greene at the first, while they are small, and not neere
maturitie, but being grown and ripe, are (as all men know) red on the
out side, some more pale then others, and some kindes of a deeper
yellowish red, according to the climate, and as it receiueth the
heate of the sunne, wherein is contained sower or sweete iuice, and
thicke white kernels among it: it beareth in the warme Countries both
blossomes and greene fruit continually vpon it, and ripe fruit also
with them for the best part of the yeare, but especially in Autumne and
Winter.

        The Vse of Orenges.

        Orenges are vsed as sawce for many sorts of meates, in respect
        of their sweete sowernesse, giuing a rellish of delight,
        whereinsoeuer they are vsed.

        The inner pulpe or iuice doth serue in agues and hot diseases,
        and in Summer to coole the heate of deiected stomackes, or
        fainting spirits.

        The dryed rinde, by reason of the sweete and strong sent,
        serueth to bee put among other things to make sweet pouthers.

        The outer rindes, when they are clensed from all the inner
        pulpe and skins, are preserued in Sugar, after the bitternesse
        by often steepings hath been taken away, & do serue either as
        Succots, and banquetting stuffes, or as ornaments to set out
        dishes for the table, or to giue a rellish vnto meats, whether
        baked or boyled: Physically they helpe to warme a cold stomack,
        and to digest or breake winde therein: or they are candid with
        Sugar, and serue with other dryed Iunquets.

        The water of Orange flowers is oftentimes vsed as a great
        perfume for gloues, to washe them, or in stead of Rose-water to
        mixe with other things.

        It is vsed to bee drunke by some, to preuent or to helpe any
        pestilentiall feuer.

        The oyntment that is made of the flowers, is very comfortable
        both for the stomache, against the could or cough, or for the
        head, for paines and disinesse.

        The kernels or seede beeing cast into the ground in the spring
        time, will quickely grow vp, (but will not abide the winter
        with vs, to bee kept for growing trees) and when they are of
        a finger length high, being pluckt vp, and put among sallets,
        will giue them a maruellous fine aromaticke or spicy taste,
        very acceptable.

        The seed or kernels are a little cordiall, although nothing so
        much as the kernels of the Pomecitron.




CHAP. XIX.

_Poma._   Apples.


The sorts of Apples are so many, and infinite almost as I may say,
that I cannot giue you the names of all, though I haue endeauoured
to giue a great many, and I thinke it almost impossible for any one,
to attaine to the full perfection of knowledge herein, not onely in
regard of the multiplicitie of fashions, colours and tastes, but in
that some are more familiar to one Countrey then to another, being of
a better or worse taste in one place then in another, and therefore
diuersly called: I will therefore as I haue done before, giue you the
description of the Tree in generall, as also of the Paradise or dwarfe
Apple, because of some especiall difference, and afterwards the names
of as many, with their fashions, as haue come to my knowledge, either
by sight or relation: for I doe confesse I haue not seene all that I
here set downe, but vse the helpe of some friends, and therefore if it
happen that the seuerall names doe not answer vnto seuerall sorts, but
that the same fruit may bee called by one name in one Country, that
is called by another elsewhere, excuse it I pray you; for in such a
number, such a fault may escape vnknowne.

The Apple tree for the most part is neyther very high, great or
straight, but rather vsually boweth and spreadeth (although in some
places it groweth fairer and straighter then in others) hauing long and
great armes or boughes, and from them smaller branches, whereon doe
grow somewhat broade, and long greene leaues, nicked about the edges:
the flowers are large and white, with blush coloured sides, consisting
of fiue leaues: the fruit (as I said) is of diuers formes, colours and
tastes, and likewise of a very variable durabilitie; for some must be
eaten presently after they are gathered, and they are for the most part
the earliest ripe; others will abide longer vpon the trees, before
they bee fit to be gathered; some also will be so hard when others are
gathered, that they will not be fit to be eaten, for one, two or three
months after they bee gathered; and some will abide good but one, two
or three moneths, and no more; and some will be best, after a quarter
or halfe a yeares lying, vnto the end of that yeare or the next.

The Paradise or dwarfe Apple tree groweth nothing so high as the
former, and many times not much higher then a man may reach, hauing
leaues and flowers altogether like the other, the fruit is a faire
yellow Apple, and reasonable great, but very light and spongy or loose,
and of a bitterish sweet taste, nothing pleasant. And these faults
also are incident vnto this tree, that both bodie and branches are
much subiect vnto cancker, which will quickely eate it round, and kill
it; besides it will haue many bunches, or tuberous swellings in many
places, which grow as it were scabby or rough, and will soone cause it
to perish: the roote sendeth forth many shootes and suckers, whereby it
may be much increased. But this benefit may be had of it, to recompence
the former faults, That being a dwarfe Tree, whatsoeuer fruit shall be
grafted on it, will keepe the graft low like vnto it selfe, and yet
beare fruit reasonable well. And this is a pretty way to haue Pippins,
Pomewaters, or any other sort of Apples (as I haue, had my selfe, and
also seene with others) growing low, that if any will, they may make a
hedge rowe of these low fruits, planted in an Orchard all along by a
walke side: but take this Caueat, if you will auoide the danger of the
cancker and knots, which spoile the tree, to graft it hard vnto the
ground, that therby you may giue as little of the nature of the stock
thereunto as possibly you can, which wil vndoubtedly help it very much.


The kindes or sorts of Apples.

  The Summer pippin is a very good apple first ripe, and therefore to
  bee first spent, because it will not abide so long as the other.

  The French pippin is also a good fruit and yellow.

  The Golding pippin is the greatest and best of all sorts of pippins.

  The Russet pippin is as good an apple as most of the other sorts of
  pippins.

  The spotted pippin is the most durable pippin of all the other sorts.

  The ordinary yellow pippin is like the other, and as good; for indeed
  I know no sort of pippins but are excellent good well rellished
  fruites.

  The great pearemaine differeth little either in taste or durabilitie
  from the pippin, and therefore next vnto it is accounted the best of
  all apples.

  The summer pearemaine is of equall goodnesse with the former, or
  rather a little more pleasing, especially for the time of its eating,
  which will not bee so long lasting, but is spent and gone when the
  other beginneth to be good to eate.

  Wildings and Crabs are without number or vse in our Orchard, being
  to be had out of the woods, fields and hedges rather then any where
  else.


        The Vse of Apples.

        The best sorts of Apples serue at the last course for the
        table, in most mens houses of account, where, if there grow any
        rare or excellent fruit, it is then set forth to be seene and
        tasted.

        Diuers other sorts serue to bake, either for the Masters
        Table, or the meynes sustenance, either in pyes or pans, or
        else stewed in dishes with Rosewater and Sugar, and Cinamon or
        Ginger cast vpon.

        Some kinds are fittest to roast in the winter time, to warme a
        cup of wine, ale or beere; or to be eaten alone, for the nature
        of some fruit is neuer so good, or worth the eating, as when
        they are roasted.

        Some sorts are fittest to scald for Codlins, and are taken to
        coole the stomacke, as well as to please the taste, hauing
        Rosewater and Sugar put to them.

        Some sorts are best to make Cider of, as in the West Countrey
        of England great quantities, yea many Hogsheads and Tunnes full
        are made, especially to bee carried to the Sea in long voyages,
        and is found by experience to bee of excellent vse, to mixe
        with water for beuerage. It is vsually seene that those fruits
        that are neither fit to eate raw, roasted, nor baked, are
        fittest for Cider, and make the best.

        The iuice of Apples likewise, as of pippins, and pearemaines,
        is of very good vse in Melancholicke diseases, helping to
        procure mirth, and to expell heauinesse.

        The distilled water of the same Apples is of the like effect.

        There is a fine sweet oyntment made of Apples called _Pomatum_,
        which is much vsed to helpe chapt lips, or hands, or for the
        face, or any other part of the skinne that is rough with winde,
        or any other accident, to supple them, and make them smooth.




CHAP. XX.

_Cydonia._   Quinces.


Wee haue some diuersities of Quinces, although not many, yet more then
our elder times were acquainted with, which shall be here expressed.

The Quince tree groweth oftentimes to the height and bignesse of a good
Apple tree, but more vsually lower, with crooked and spreading armes
and branches farre abroad, the leaues are somewhat round, and like the
leaues of the Apple tree, but thicker, harder, fuller of veines, and
white on the vnderside: the blossomes or flowers are white, now and
then dasht ouer with blush, being large and open, like vnto a single
Rose: the fruit followeth, which when it is ripe is yellow, and couered
with a white cotton or freeze, which in the younger is thicker and
more plentifull, but waxeth lesse and lesse, as the fruit ripeneth,
being bunched out many times in seuerall places, and round, especially
about the head, some greater, others smaller, some round like an
Apple, others long like a Peare, of a strong heady sent, accounted not
wholsome or long to be endured, and of no durabilitie to keepe, in the
middle whereof is a core, with many blackish seedes or kernels therein,
lying close together in cels, and compassed with a kinde of cleare
gelly, which is easier seene in the scalded fruit, then in the raw.

The English Quince is the ordinarie Apple Quince, set downe before, and
is of so harsh a taste being greene, that no man can endure to eate it
rawe, but eyther boyled, stewed, roasted or baked; all which waies it
is very good.

The Portingall Apple Quince is a great yellow Quince, seldome comming
to bee whole and faire without chapping; this is so pleasant being
fresh gathered, that it may be eaten like vnto an Apple without offence.

The Portingall Peare Quince is not fit to be eaten rawe like the
former, but must be vsed after some of the waies the English Quince is
appointed, and so it will make more dainty dishes then the English,
because it is lesse harsh, will bee more tender, and take lesse sugar
for the ordering then the English kinde.

The Barbary Quince is like in goodnesse vnto the Portingall Quince last
spoken of, but lesser in bignesse.

The Lyons Quince.

The Brunswicke Quince.


        The Vse of Quinces.

        There is no fruit growing in this Land that is of so many
        excellent vses as this, seruing as well to make many dishes
        of meate for the table, as for banquets, and much more for
        the Physicall vertues, whereof to write at large is neither
        conuenient for mee, nor for this worke: I will onely briefly
        recite some, as it were to giue you a taste of that plenty
        remaineth therein, to bee conuerted into sundry formes: as
        first for the table, while they are fresh (and all the yeare
        long after being pickled vp) to be baked, as a dainty dish,
        being well and orderly cookt. And being preserued whole in
        Sugar, either white or red, serue likewise, not onely as an
        after dish to close vp the stomacke, but is placed among other
        Preserues by Ladies and Gentlewomen, and bestowed on their
        friends to entertaine them, and among other sorts of Preserues
        at Banquets. Codimacke also and Marmilade, Ielly and Paste, are
        all made of Quinces, chiefly for delight and pleasure, although
        they haue also with them some physicall properties.

        We haue for the vse of physicke, both Iuyce and Syrupe, both
        Conserue and Condite, both binding and loosening medicines,
        both inward and outward, and all made of Quinces.

        The Ielly or Muccilage of the seedes, is often vsed to be laid
        vpon womens breasts, to heale them being sore or rawe, by their
        childrens default giuing them sucke.

        Athenæus reciteth in his third booke, that one Philarchus
        found, that the smell of Quinces tooke away the strength of a
        certaine poison, called _Phariacum_. And the Spaniards haue
        also found, that the strength of the iuyce of white Ellebor
        (which the Hunters vse as a poyson to dippe their arrow heads
        in, that they shoote at wilde beasts to kill them) is quite
        taken away, if it stand within the compasse of the smell of
        Quinces. And also that Grapes, being hung vp to bee kept, and
        spent in Winter, doe quickly rot with the smell of a Quince.




CHAP. XXI.

_Pyra._   Peares.


The variety of peares is as much or more then of apples, and I thinke
it is as hard in this, as before in apples, for any to be so exquisite,
as that hee could number vp all the sorts that are to be had: for wee
haue in our country so manie, as I shall giue you the names of by and
by, and are hitherto come to our knowledge: but I verily beleeue that
there be many, both in our country, and in others, that we haue not yet
knowne or heard of; for euery yeare almost wee attaine to the knowledge
of some, we knew not of before. Take therefore, according to the manner
before held, the description of one, with the seuerall names of the
rest, vntill a more exact discourse be had of them, euery one apart.

The Peare tree groweth more slowly, but higher, and more vpright then
the apple tree, and not lesse in the bulke of the body: his branches
spread not so farre or wide, but growe vprighter and closer: the leaues
are somewhat broader and rounder, greene aboue, and whiter vnderneath
then those of the apple tree: the flowers are whiter and greater: the
fruit is longer then round for the most part, smaller at the stalke,
and greater at the head, of so many differing formes, colours, and
tastes, that hardly can one distinguish rightly between them, the times
also being as variable in the gathering and spending of them, as in
apples: the roote groweth deeper then the apple tree, and therefore
abideth longer, and giueth a faster, closer, & smoother gentle wood,
easie to be wrought vpon.

The kindes of Peares.

  The Summer bon Chretien is somewhat a long peare, with a greene and
  yellow russetish coate, and will haue sometimes red sides; it is ripe
  at Michaelmas: some vse to dry them as they doe Prunes, and keepe
  them all the yeare after. I haue not seene or heard any more Summer
  kindes hereof then this one, and needeth no wall to nourse it as the
  other.

  The Winter bon Chretien is of many sorts, some greater, others
  lesser, and all good; but the greatest and best is that kinde that
  groweth at Syon: All the kinds of this Winter fruit must be planted
  against a wall, or else they will both seldome beare, and bring fewer
  also to ripenesse, comparable to the wall fruit: the kindes also are
  according to their lasting; for some will endure good much longer
  then others.

  The Summer Bergomot is an excellent well rellished peare, flattish,
  & short, not long like others, of a meane bignesse, and of a darke
  yellowish greene colour on the outside.

  The Winter Bergomot is of two or three sorts, being all of them small
  fruit, somewhat greener on the outside then the Summer kindes; all
  of them very delicate and good in their due time: for some will not
  be fit to bee eaten when others are well-nigh spent, euery of them
  outlasting another by a moneth or more.

  The Diego peare is but a small peare, but an excellent well rellished
  fruit, tasting as if Muske had been put among it; many of them growe
  together, as it were in clusters.

  The Duetete or double headed peare, so called of the forme, is a very
  good peare, not very great, of a russettish browne colour on the
  outside.

  The Primating peare is a good moist peare, and early ripe.

  The Geneting peare is a very good early ripe peare.

  The greene Chesill is a delicate mellow peare, euen melting as it
  were in the mouth of the eater, although greenish on the outside.

  The Catherine peare is knowne to all I thinke to be a yellow red
  sided peare, of a full waterish sweete taste, and ripe with the
  foremost.

  The King Catherine is greater then the other, and of the same
  goodnesse, or rather better.

  The Russet Catherine is a very good middle sized peare.

  The Windsor peare is an excellent good peare, well knowne to most
  persons, and of a reasonable greatnesse: it will beare fruit some
  times twice in a yeare (and as it is said) three times in some places.

  The Norwich peare is of two sorts, Summer and Winter, both of them
  good fruit, each in their season.

  The Worster peare is blackish, a farre better peare to bake (when as
  it will be like a Warden, and as good) then to eate rawe; yet so it
  is not to be misliked.

  The Muske peare is like vnto a Catherine peare for bignesse, colour,
  and forme; but farre more excellent in taste, as the very name
  importeth.

  The Rosewater peare is a goodly faire peare, and of a delicate taste.

  The Sugar peare is an early peare, very sweete, but waterish.

  The Summer Popperin} both of them are very good dry
                     } firme peares, somewhat spotted,
  The Winter Popperin} and brownish on the outside.

  The greene Popperin is a winter fruit, of equall goodnesse with the
  former.

  The Soueraigne peare, that which I haue seene and tasted, and so
  termed vnto me, was a small brownish yellow peare, but of a most
  dainty taste; but some doe take a kind of Bon Chretien, called the
  Elizabeth peare, to be the Soueraigne peare; how truely let others
  iudge.

  The Kings peare is a very good and well tasted peare.

  The peare Royall is a great peare, and of a good rellish.

  The Warwicke peare is a reasonable faire and good peare.

  The Greenfield peare is a very good peare, of a middle size.

  The Lewes peare is a brownish greene peare, ripe about the end of
  September, a reasonable well rellished fruit, and very moist.

  The Bishop peare is a middle sized peare, of a reasonable good taste,
  not very waterish; but this property is oftentimes seene in it, that
  before the fruit is gathered, (but more vsually those that fall of
  themselues, and the rest within a while after they are gathered) will
  be rotten at the core, when there will not be a spot or blemish to
  bee seene on the outside, or in all the peare, vntill you come neare
  the core.

  The Wilford peare is a good and a faire peare.

  The Bell peare a very good greene peare.

  The Portingall peare is a great peare, but more goodly in shew then
  good indeed.

  The Gratiola peare is a kinde of Bon Chretien, called the Cowcumber
  peare, or Spinola’s peare.

  The Rowling peare is a good peare, but hard, and not good before it
  bee a little rowled or bruised, to make it eate the more mellow.

  The Pimpe peare is as great as the Windsor peare, but rounder, and of
  a very good rellish.

  The Turnep peare is a hard winter peare, not so good to eate rawe, as
  it is to bake.

  The Arundell peare is most plentifull in Suffolke, and there
  commended to be a verie good peare.

  The Berry peare is a Summer peare, reasonable faire and great, and of
  so good and wholsome a taste, that few or none take harme by eating
  neuer so many of them.

  The Sand peare is a reasonable good peare, but small.

  The Morley peare is a very good peare, like in forme and Colour vnto
  the Windsor, but somewhat grayer.

  The peare pricke is very like vnto the Greenfield peare, being both
  faire, great, and good.

  The good Rewell is a reasonable great peare, as good to bake as to
  eate rawe, and both wayes it is a good fruit.

  The Hawkes bill peare is of a middle size, somewhat like vnto the
  Rowling peare.

  The Petworth peare is a winter peare, and is great, somewhat long,
  faire, and good.

  The Slipper peare is a reasonable good peare.

  The Robert peare is a very good peare, plentifull in Suffolke and
  Norfolke.

  The pound peare is a reasonable good peare, both to eate rawe, and to
  bake.

  The ten pound peare, or the hundred pound peare, the truest and best,
  is the best Bon Chretien of Syon, so called, because the grafts cost
  the Master so much the fetching by the messengers expences, when he
  brought nothing else.

  The Gilloflower peare is a winter peare, faire in shew, but hard, and
  not fit to bee eaten rawe, but very good to bake.

  The peare Couteau is neither good one way nor other.

  The Binsce peare is a reasonable good winter peare, of a russetish
  colour, and a small fruit: but will abide good a long while.

  The Pucell is a greene peare, of an indifferent good taste.

  The blacke Sorrell is a reasonable great long peare, of a darke red
  colour on the outside.

  The red Sorrell is of a redder colour, else like the other.

  The Surrine is no very good peare.

  The Summer Hasting is a little greene peare, of an indifferent good
  rellish.

  Peare Gergonell is an early peare, somewhat long, and of a very
  pleasant taste.

  The white Genneting is a reasonable good peare, yet not equall to the
  other.

  The Sweater is somewhat like the Windsor for colour and bignesse, but
  nothing neare of so good a taste.

  The bloud red peare is of a darke red colour on the outside, but
  piercing very little into the inner pulpe.

  The Hony peare is a long greene Summer peare.

  The Winter peare is of many sorts, but this is onely so called, to
  bee distinguished from all other Winter peares, which haue seuerall
  names giuen them, and is a very good peare.

  The Warden or Luke Wards peare of two sorts, both white and red, both
  great and small.

  The Spanish Warden is greater then either of both the former, and
  better also.

  The peare of Ierusalem, or the stript peare, whose barke while it is
  young, is as plainly seene to be stript with greene, red, and yellow,
  as the fruit it selfe is also, and is of a very good taste: being
  baked also, it is as red as the best Warden, whereof Master William
  Ward of Essex hath assured mee, who is the chiefe keeper of the Kings
  Granary at Whitehall.

  Hereof likewise there is a wilde kinde no bigger then ones thumbe,
  and striped in the like manner, but much more.

  The Choke peares, and other Wilde peares, both great and small, as
  they are not to furnish our Orchard, but the Woods, Forrests, Fields,
  and Hedges, so wee leaue them to their naturall places, and to them
  that keep them, and make good vse of them.


        The Vse of Peares.

        The most excellent sorts of Peares, serue (as I said before of
        Apples) to make an after-course for their masters table, where
        the goodnesse of his Orchard is tryed. They are dryed also, and
        so are an excellent repaste, if they be of the best kindes, fit
        for the purpose.

        They are eaten familiarly of all sorts of people, of some for
        delight, and of others for nourishment, being baked, stewed, or
        scalded.

        The red Warden and the Spanish Warden are reckoned among the
        most excellent of Peares, either to bake or to roast, for the
        sicke or for the sound: And indeede, the Quince and the Warden
        are the two onely fruits are permitted to the sicke, to eate at
        any time.

        Perry, which is the iuyce of Peares pressed out, is a drinke
        much esteemed as well as Cyder, to be both drunke at home, and
        carried to the Sea, and found to be of good vse in long voyages.

        The Perry made of Choke Peares, notwithstanding the harshnesse,
        and euill taste, both of the fruit when it is greene, as also
        of the iuyce when it is new made, doth yet after a few moneths
        become as milde and pleasant as wine, and will hardly bee
        knowne by the sight or taste from it: this hath beene found
        true by often experience; and therefore wee may admire the
        goodnesse of God, that hath giuen such faculty to so wilde
        fruits, altogether thought vselesse, to become vsefull, and
        apply the benefit thereof both to the comfort of our soules and
        bodies.

        For the Physicall properties, if we doe as Galen teacheth vs,
        _in secundo Alimentorum_, referre the qualities of Peares to
        their seuerall tastes, as before he had done in Apples, we
        shall not neede to make a new worke; those that are harsh and
        sowre doe coole and binde, sweet do nourish and warme, and
        those betweene these, to haue middle vertues, answerable to
        their temperatures, &c.

        Much more might be said, both of this and the other kinds of
        fruits; but let this suffice for this place and worke, vntill a
        more exact be accomplished.

_Nux Iuglans._   The Wallnut.


Although the Wallnut tree bee often planted in the middle of great
Courtyards, where by reason of his great spreading armes it taketh vp
a great deale of roome, his shadow reaching farre, so that scarce any
thing can well grow neare it; yet because it is likewise planted in fit
places or corners of Orchards, and that it beareth fruit or nuts, often
brought to the table, especially while they are freshest, sweetest, and
fitted to be eaten, let not my Orchard want his company, or you the
knowledge of it. Some doe thinke that there are many sorts of them,
because some are much greater then others, and some longer then others,
and some haue a more frangible shell then others; but I am certainly
perswaded, that the soyle and climate where they grow, are the whole
and onely cause of the varieties and differences. Indeed Virginia hath
sent vnto vs two sorts of Wallnuts, the one blacke, the other white,
whereof as yet wee haue no further knowledge. And I know that Clusius
reporteth, he tooke vp at a banquet a long Wallnut, differing in forme
and tendernesse of shell from others, which being set, grew and bore
farre tenderer leaues then the others and a little snipt about the
edges, which (as I said) might alter with the soyle and climate: and
besides you may obserue, that many of Clusius differences are very
nice, and so I leaue it.

The Wallnut tree groweth very high and great, with a large and thicke
body or trunke, couered with a thicke clouen whitish greene barke,
tending to an ash colour; the armes are great, and spread farre,
breaking out into smaller branches, whereon doe growe long & large
leaues, fiue or seuen set together one against another, with an odde
one at the end, somewhat like vnto ashen leaues, but farre larger, and
not so many on a stalke, smooth, and somewhat reddish at the first
springing, and tender also, of a reasonable good sent, but more strong
and headie when they growe old: the fruit or nut is great and round,
growing close to the stalkes of the leaues, either by couples or by
three set together, couered with a double shell, that is to say, with
a greene thicke and soft outer rinde, and an inner hard shell, within
which the white kernell is contained, couered with a thinne yellow
rinde or peeling, which is more easily peeled away while it is greene
then afterwards, and is as it were parted into foure quarters, with a
thinne wooddy peece parting it at the head, very sweete and pleasant
while it is fresh, and for a while after the gathering; but the elder
they growe, the harder and more oily: the catkins or blowings are long
and yellow, made of many scaly leaues set close together, which come
forth early in the Spring, and when they open and fall away, vpon their
stalkes arise certaine small flowers, which turne into so many nuts.


        The Vse of Wallnuts.

        They are often serued to the table with other fruits while they
        abide fresh and sweete; and therefore many to keepe them fresh
        a long time haue deuised many wayes, as to put them into great
        pots, and bury them in the ground, and so take them out as they
        spend them, which is a very good way, and will keepe them long.

        The small young nuts while they are tender, being preserued or
        candid, are vsed among other sorts of candid fruits, that serue
        at banquets.

        The iuyce of the outer greene huskes are held to be a
        soueraigne remedy against either poyson, or plague, or
        pestilentiall feuer.

        The distilled water of the huskes drunke with a little vinegar,
        if the fits growe hot and tedious, is an approued remedy for
        the same.

        The water distilled from the leaues, is effectuall to be
        applyed to fluent or running vlcers, to dry and binde the
        humours.

        Some haue vsed the pouder of the catkins in white wine, for the
        suffocation or strangling of the mother.

        The oyle of Wallnuts is vsed to varnish Ioyners workes. As
        also is accounted farre to excell Linseede oyle, to mixe a
        white colour withall, that the colour bee not dimmed. It is of
        excellent vse for the coldnesse, hardnesse and contracting of
        the sinewes and ioynts, to warme, supple, and to extend them.




CHAP. XXIII.

_Castanea Equina._   The Horse Chesnut.


Although the ordinary Chesnut is not a tree planted in Orchards, but
left to Woods, Parkes, and other such like places; yet wee haue another
sort which wee haue noursed vp from the nuts sent vs from Turky, of a
greater and more pleasant aspect for the faire leaues, and of as good
vse for the fruit. It groweth in time to be a great tree, spreading
with great armes and branches, whereon are set at seuerall distances
goodly faire great greene leaues, diuided into six, seuen, or nine
parts or leaues, euery one of them nicked about the edges, very like
vnto the leaues of _Ricinus_, or _Palma Christi_, and almost as great:
it beareth at the ends of the branches many flowers set together vpon
a long stalke, consisting of foure white leaues a peece, with many
threads in the middle, which afterwards turne into nuts, like vnto the
ordinary Chesnuts, but set in rougher and more prickly huskes: the nuts
themselues being rounder and blacker, with a white spot at the head of
each, formed somewhat like an heart, and of a little sweeter taste.


        The Vse of this Chesnut.

        It serueth to binde and stop any maner of fluxe, be it of bloud
        or humours, either of the belly or stomacke; also the much
        spitting of bloud. They are roasted and eaten as the ordinary
        sort, to make them taste the better.

        They are vsually in Turkie giuen to horses in their prouender,
        to cure them of coughes, and helpe them being broken winded.




CHAP. XXIIII.

_Morus._   The Mulberrie.


There are two sorts of Mulberries sufficiently known to most, the
blackish and the white: but wee haue had brought vs from Virginia
another sort, which is of greater respect then eyther of the other
two, not onely in regard of the raritie, but of the vse, as you shall
presently vnderstand.


1. _Morus nigra._   The blacke Mulberrie.

The blacke Mulberrie tree groweth oftentimes tall and great, and
oftentimes also crooked, and spreading abroade, rather then high; for
it is subiect to abide what forme you will conforme it vnto: if by
suffering it to grow, it will mount vp, and if you will binde it, or
plash the boughes, they will so abide, and be carried ouer arbours, or
other things as you will haue it. The bodie groweth in time to bee very
great, couered with a rugged or thicke barke, the armes or branches
being smoother, whereon doe grow round thicke leaues pointed at the
ends, and nicked about the edges, and in some there are to be seene
deep gashes, making it seeme somewhat like the Vine leafe: the flowers
are certaine short dounie catkings, which turne into greene berries at
the first, afterwards red, and when they are full ripe blacke, made of
many graines set together, like vnto the blacke berrie, but longer and
greater: before they are ripe, they haue an austere and harsh taste,
but when they are full ripe, they are more sweete and pleasant; the
iuice whereof is so red, that it will staine the hands of them that
handle and eate them.


2. _Morus alba._   The white Mulberrie.

The white Mulberrie tree groweth not with vs to that greatnesse or
bulke of bodie that the blacke doth, but runneth vp higher, slenderer,
more knotty, hard and brittle, with thinner spreade armes and branches:
the leaues are like the former, but not so thicke set on the branches,
nor so hard in handling, a little paler also, hauing somewhat longer
stalkes: the fruit is smaller and closer set together, greene, and
somewhat harsh before they be ripe, but of a wonderfull sweetnesse,
almost ready to procure loathing when they are thorough ripe, and
white, with such like seede in them as in the former, but smaller.


3. _Morus Virginiana._   The Virginia Mulberrie.

The Virginia Mulberry tree groweth quickely with vs to be a very great
tree, spreading many armes and branches, whereon grow faire great
leaues, very like vnto the leaues of the white Mulberrie tree: the
berry or fruit is longer and redder then either of the other, and of a
very pleasant taste.

        The Vse of Mulberries.

        The greatest and most especiall vse of the planting of white
        Mulberries, is for the feeding of Silke wormes, for which
        purpose all the Easterne Countries, as Persia, Syria, Armenia,
        Arabia &c. and also the hither part of Turkie, Spaine also and
        Italie, and many other hot Countries doe nourish them, because
        it is best for that purpose, the wormes feeding thereon, giuing
        the finest and best silke; yet some are confident that the
        leaues of the blacke will doe as much good as the white: but
        that respect must be had to change your seede, because therein
        lyeth the greatest mysterie. But there is a Booke or Tractate
        printed, declaring the whole vse of whatsoeuer can belong vnto
        them: I will therefore referre them thereunto, that would
        further vnderstand of that matter.

        Mulberries are not much desired to be eaten, although they be
        somewhat pleasant, both for that they staine their fingers and
        lips that eate them, and doe quickly putrefie in the stomacke,
        if they bee not taken before meate.

        They haue yet a Physicall vse, which is by reason of the
        astringent quality while they are red, and before they bee
        ripe, for sore mouthes and throats, or the like, whereunto also
        the Syrup, called Diamoron, is effectuall.




_Corollarium._

A COROLLARIE

To this Orchard.


There are certaine other trees that beare no fruit fit to bee eaten,
which yet are often seene planted in Orchards, and other fit and
conuenient places about an house, whereof some are of especiall vse,
as the Bay tree &c. others for their beauty and shadow are fit for
walkes or arbours; some being euer green are most fit for hedge-rowes;
and some others more for their raritie then for any other great vse,
whereof I thought good to entreat apart by themselues, and bring them
after the fruit trees of this Orchard, as an ornament to accomplish the
same.


1. _Laurus._   The Bay tree.

There are to bee reckoned vp fiue kindes of Bay trees, three whereof
haue been entreated of in the first part, a fourth wee will only bring
here to your consideration, which is that kinde that is vsually planted
in euery mans yard or orchard, for their vse throughout the whole land,
the other we will leaue to bee considered of in that place is fit for
it.

The Bay tree riseth vp oftentimes to carry the face of a tree of a
meane bignesse in our Countrey (although much greater in the hoter) and
oftentimes shooteth vp with many suckers from the roote, shewing it
selfe more like to a tall shrubbe or hedge-bush, then a tree, hauing
many branches, the young ones whereof are sometimes reddish, but
most vsually of a light or fresh greene colour, when the stemme and
elder boughes are couered with a darke greene barke: the leaues are
somewhat broad, and long pointed as it were at both the ends, hard and
sometimes crumpled on the edges, of a darke greene colour aboue, and
of a yellowish greene vnderneath, in smell sweet, in taste bitter, and
abiding euer greene: the flowers are yellow and mossie, which turne
into berries that are a little long as well as round, whose shell or
outermost peele is greene at the first, and black when it is ripe;
wherein is contained an hard bitter kernell, which cleaueth in two
parts.


        The Vse of Bayes.

        The Bay leaues are of as necessary vse as any other in Garden
        or Orchard; for they serue both for pleasure and profit, both
        for ornament and for vse, both for honest Ciuill vses, and for
        Physicke, yea both for the sicke and for the sound, both for
        the liuing and for the dead: And so much might be said of this
        one tree, that if it were all told, would as well weary the
        Reader, as the Relater: but to explaine my selfe; It serueth
        to adorne the house of God as well as of man: to procure
        warmth, comfort and strength to the limmes of men and women, by
        bathings and annoyntings outward, and by drinkes &c. inward to
        the stomacke, and other parts: to season vessels &c. wherein
        are preserued our meates, as well as our drinkes: to crowns or
        encircle as with a garland, the heads of the liuing, and to
        sticke and decke forth the bodies of the dead: so that from
        the cradle to the graue we haue still vse of it, we haue still
        neede of it.

        The berries likewise serue for stitches inward, and for paines
        outward, that come of cold eyther in the ioynts, sinewes, or
        other places.


2. _Laurea Cerasus, siue Laurus Virginiana._
The Virginian Bay, or Cherry Baye.

This Virginian (whether you will call it a Baye, or a Cherrie, or a
Cherrie Bay, I leaue it to euery ones free will and iudgement, but
yet I thinke I may as well call it a Bay as others a Cherrie, neither
of them being answerable to the tree, which neyther beareth such
berries as are like Cherries, neither beareth euer greene leaues like
the Bay: if it may therefore bee called the Virginia Cherry Bay, for
a distinction from the former Bay Cherry that beareth faire blacke
Cherries, it will more fitly agree thereunto, vntill a more proper may
be imposed) riseth vp to be a tree of a reasonable height, the stemme
or bodie thereof being almost as great as a mans legge, spreading
forth into diuers armes or boughes, and they againe into diuers small
branches, whereon are set without order diuers faire broade greene
leaues, somewhat like vnto the former Bay leaues, but more limber and
gentle, and not so hard in handling, broader also, and for the most
part ending in a point but in many somewhat round pointed, very finely
notched or toothed about the edges, of a bitter taste, very neere
resembling the taste of the Bay leafe, but of little or no sent at
all, either greene or dryed, which fall away euery autumne, and spring
afresh euery yeare: the blossomes are small and white, many growing
together vpon a long stalke, somewhat like the Bird Cherry blossomes,
but smaller, and come forth at the ends of the young branches, which
after turne into small berries, euery one set in a small cup or huske,
greene at the first, and blacke when they are ripe, of the bignesse
of a small pease, of a strong bitter taste, and somewhat aromaticall
withall, but without any fleshy substance like a Cherry at all vpon it;
for it is altogether like a berry.


        The Vse of this Virginia Cherry Bay.

        Being a stranger in our Land, and possessed but of a very few,
        I doe not heare that there hath beene any triall made thereof
        what properties are in it: let this therefore suffice for this
        present, to haue shewed you the description and forme thereof,
        vntill we can learne further of his vses.


3. _Pinus._   The Pine tree.

My purpose in this place is not to shew you all the diuersities of Pine
trees, or of the rest that follow, but of that one kinde is planted
in many places of our Land for ornament and delight, and there doth
reasonably well abide: take it therefore into this Orchard, for the
raritie and beautie of it, though we haue little other vse of it.

The Pine tree groweth with vs, though slowely, to a very great height
in many places, with a great straight bodie, couered with a grayish
greene barke, the younger branches are set round about, with very
narrow long whitish greene leaues, which fall away from the elder, but
abide on the younger, being both winter and summer alwaies greene. It
hath growing in sundry places on the branches, certaine great hard
wooddy clogs (called of some apples, of others nuts) composed of many
hard wooddy scales, or tuberous knobs, which abide for the most part
alwaies greene in our Countrey, and hardly become brownish, as in other
Countries, where they haue more heat and comfort of the Sun, and where
the scales open themselues; wherein are contained white long and round
kernels, very sweete while they are fresh, but quickely growing oylely
and rancide.


        The Vse of the Pine apples and kernels.

        The Cones or Apples are vsed of diuers Vintners in this City,
        being painted, to expresse a bunch of grapes, whereunto they
        are very like, and are hung vp in their bushes, as also to
        fasten keyes vnto them, as is seene in many places.

        The kernels within the hard shels, while they are fresh or
        newly taken out, are vsed many waies, both with Apothecaries,
        Comfit-makers, and Cookes: for of them are made medicines,
        good to lenifie the pipes and passages of the lungs and
        throate, when it is hoarse. Of them are made Comfits, Pastes,
        Marchpanes, and diuers other such like: And with them a cunning
        Cooke can make diuers Keck shoses for his Masters table.

        Matthiolus commendeth the water of the greene apples
        distilled, to take away the wrinkles in the face, to abate the
        ouer-swelling breasts of Maidens, by fomenting them after with
        linnen clothes, wet in the water; and to restore such as are
        rauisht into better termes.


4. _Abies._   The Firre tree.

The Firre tree groweth naturally higher then any other tree in these
parts of Christendome where no Cedars grow, and euen equalling or
ouer-topping the Pine: the stemme or bodie is bare without branches for
a great height, if they bee elder trees, and then branching forth at
one place of the bodie foure wayes in manner of a crosse, those boughes
againe hauing two branches at euery ioynt, on which are set on all
sides very thicke together many small narrow long hard whitish greene
leaues, and while they are young tending to yellownesse, but nothing
so long or hard or sharpe pointed as the Pine tree leaues, growing
smaller and shorter to the end of the branches: the bloomings are
certaine small long scaly catkins, of a yellowish colour, comming forth
at the ioynts of the branches, which fall away: the cones are smaller
and longer then of the Pine tree, wherein are small three square seede
contained, not halfe so big as the Pine kernels.


        The Vse of the Firre tree.

        The vse of this tree is growne with vs of late daies to bee
        more frequent for the building of houses then euer before: for
        hereof (namely of Deale timber and Deale boords) are framed
        many houses, and their floores, without the helpe of any other
        timber or boord of any other tree almost; as also for many
        other workes and purposes. The yellow Rossen that is vsed as
        well to make salues as for many other common vses, is taken
        from this tree, as the Pitch is both from the Pitch and Pine
        trees, and is boyled to make it to bee hard, but was at the
        first a yellow thin cleere Turpentine, and is that best sort of
        common Turpentine is altogether in vse with vs, as also another
        more thicke, whitish, and troubled, both which are vsed in
        salues, both for man and beast (but not inwardly as the cleere
        white Venice Turpentine is) and serueth both to draw, cleanse
        and heale. Dodonæus seemeth to say, that the cleere white
        Turpentine, called Venice Turpentine, is drawn from the Firre:
        but Matthiolus confuteth that opinion, which Fulsius also held
        before him.

   5 _Arbutus._ The Strawberry tree.
   6 _Alaternus._ The euer greene Priuet.
]


5. _Ilex arbor._   The euer-greene Oake.

The _Ilex_ or euer-greene Oake riseth in time to be a very great tree,
but very long and slow in growing (as is to be seene in the Kings priuy
Garden at Whitehall, growing iust against the backe gate that openeth
into the way going to Westminster, and in some other places) spreading
many fair large great armes and branches, whereon are set small and
hard greene leaues, somewhat endented or cornered, and prickly on the
edges, especially in the young trees, and sometimes on those branches
that are young and newly sprung forth from the elder rootes, but else
in a manner all smooth in the elder growne, abiding greene all the
winter as well as summer, and are of a grayish greene on the vnderside.
It beareth in the spring time certaine slender long branches (like as
other Okes doe) with small yellowish mossie flowers on them, which fall
away, and are vnprofitable, the acornes not growing from those places,
but from others which are like vnto those of our ordinary Oake, but
smaller and blacker, and set in a more rugged huske or cuppe. This and
no other kinde of _Ilex_ doe I know to grow in all our land in any
Garden or Orchard: for that kind with long and narrower leaues, and
not prickly, growing so plentifully as Matthiolus saith in Tuscane,
I haue not seen: and it is very probable to bee the same that Plinie
remembreth to haue the leafe of an Oliue; but not as some would haue
it, that _Smilax_ Theophrastus maketh mention of in his third Booke
and sixteenth Chapter of his Historie of Plants, which the Arcadians
so called, and had the leafe of the _Ilex_, but not prickly: for
Theophrastus saith, the timber of _Smilax_ is smooth and soft, and this
of the _Ilex_ is harder, and stronger then an Oake.


        The Vse of the _Ilex_ or euer-greene Oake.

        Seeing this is to be accounted among the kindes of Oake (and
        all Oakes by Dioscorides his opinion are binding) it is also
        of the same qualitie, but a little weaker, and may serue to
        strengthen weake members. The young tops and leaues are also
        vsed in gargles for the mouth and throate.


6. _Cupressus._   The Cypresse tree.

The Cypresse tree that is noursed vp by vs, in our Country, doth grow
in those places where it hath beene long planted, to a very great
height, whose bodie and boughes are couered with a reddish ash-coloured
bark; the branches grow not spreading, but vpright close vnto the
bodie, bushing thicke below, and small vpwards, spire fashion, those
below reaching neere halfe the way to them aboue, whereon doe grow euer
greene leaues, small, long and flat, of a resinous sweete smell, and
strong taste, somewhat bitter: the fruit, which are called nuts, grow
here and there among the boughes, sticking close vnto them, which are
small, and clouen into diuers parts, but close while they are young, of
a russetish browne colour; wherein are contained small browne seede,
but not so small as motes in the Sunne, as Matthiolus and others make
them to be.


        The Vse of the Cypresse tree.

        For the goodly proportion this tree beareth, as also for his
        euer-greene head, it is and hath beene of great account with
        all Princes, both beyond, and on this side of the Sea, to plant
        them in rowes on both sides of some spatious walke, which
        by reason of their high growing, and little spreading, must
        be planted the thicker together, and so they giue a goodly,
        pleasant and sweet shadow: or else alone, if they haue not
        many, in the middle of some quarter, or as they thinke meete.
        The wood thereof is firme and durable, or neuer decaying, of
        a brown yellow colour, and of a strong sweete smell, whereof
        Chests or Boxes are made to keepe apparell, linnen, furres, and
        other things, to preserue them from moths, and to giue them a
        good smell.

        Many Physicall properties, both wood, leaues and nuts haue,
        which here is not my purpose to vnfold, but only to tell you,
        that the leaues being boyled in wine, and drunke, helpe the
        difficultie of making vrine, and that the nuts are binding,
        fit to bee vsed to stay fluxes or laskes, and good also for
        ruptures.


7. _Arbutus._   The Strawberry tree.

The Strawberry tree groweth but slowly, and riseth not to the height
of any great tree, no not in France, Italy, or Spaine: and with vs the
coldnesse of our country doth the more abate his vigour, so that it
seldome riseth to the height of a man: the barke of the body is rough,
and smooth in the younger branches: the leaues are faire and greene,
very like vnto Baye leaues, finely dented or snipped about the edges,
abiding alwayes greene thereon both Winter and Summer: the flowers come
forth at the end of the branches vpon long stalkes, not clustering
thicke together, but in long bunches, and are small, white, and hollow,
like a little bottle, or the flower of Lilly Conually, which after
turne into rough or rugged berries, most like vnto Strawberries (which
hath giuen the name to the tree) somewhat reddish when they are ripe,
of a harsh taste, nothing pleasant, wherein are contained many small
seedes: It hardly bringeth his fruit to ripenesse in our countrey; for
in their naturall places they ripen not vntill Winter, which there is
much milder then with vs.


        The Vse of the Strawberry tree.

        Amatus Lusitanus I thinke is the first that euer recorded, that
        the water distilled from the leaues and flowers hereof, should
        bee very powerfull against the plague and poysons: for all the
        ancient Writers doe report, that the fruit hereof being eaten,
        is an enemy to the stomacke and head. And Clusius likewise
        setteth downe, that at Lishbone, and other places in Portingall
        where they are frequent, they are chiefly eaten, but of the
        poorer sort, women and boyes. They are somewhat astringent or
        binding, and therefore may well serue for fluxes. It is chiefly
        noursed with vs for the beauty and rarenesse of the tree; for
        that it beareth his leaues alwayes green.


8. _Alaternus._   The euer greene Priuet.

The tree which we haue growing in our country called _Alaternus_,
groweth not to be a tree of any height; but abiding lowe, spreadeth
forth many branches, whereon are set diuers small and hard, greene
leaues, somewhat round for the forme, and endented a little by the
edges: it beareth many small whitish greene flowers at the ioynts of
the stalkes, and setting on of the lower leaues clustering thicke
together, which after turne into small blacke berries, wherein are
contained many small graines or seedes: the beauty and verdure of these
leaues abiding so fresh all the yeare, doth cause it to be of the
greater respect; and therefore findeth place in their Gardens onely,
that are curious conseruers of all natures beauties.


        The Vse of the euer greene Priuet.

        It is seldome vsed for any Physicall property, neither with vs,
        nor in the places where it is naturall and plentifull: but as
        Clusius reporteth, hee learned that the Portingall Fishermen do
        dye their nets red with the decoction of the barke hereof, and
        that the Dyers in those parts doe vse the small peeces of the
        wood to strike a blackish blew colour.


9. _Celastrus Theophrasti Clusio._   Clusius his Celastrus.

Although the Collectour (who is thought to be Ioannes Molineus of the
great Herball or History of plants, and generally bearing Daleschampius
name, because the finding and relation of diuers herbes therein
expressed, is appropriate to him, and printed at Lyons) of all our
moderne Writers doth first of all others appoint the _Celastrus_,
whereof Theophrastus onely among all the ancient Writers of plants
maketh mention, to be the first _Alaternus_ that Clusius hath set forth
in his History of rarer plants: yet I finde, that Clusius himselfe
before his death doth appropriate that _Celastrus_ of Theophrastus
to another plant, growing in the Garden at Leyden, which formerly of
diuers had beene taken to be a kinde of _Laurus Tinus_, or the wilde
Baye; but he impugning that opinion for diuers respects, decyphreth
out that Leyden tree in the same manner that I doe: and because it is
not onely faire, in bearing his leaues alwayes greene, but rare also,
being noursed vp in our Land in very few places, but principally with a
good old Lady, the widow of Sir Iohn Leuson, dwelling neere Rochester
in Kent; I thought it fit to commend it for an ornament, to adorne this
our Garden and Orchard. It groweth vp to the height of a reasonable
tree, the body whereof is couered with a darke coloured barke, as the
elder branches are in like manner; the younger branches being greene,
whereon are set diuers leaues thicke together, two alwayes at a ioynt,
one against another, of a sad but faire greene colour on the vpperside,
and paler vnderneath, which are little or nothing at all snipped about
the edges, as large as the leaues of the _Laurus Tinus_, or wilde Baye
tree: at the end of the young branches breake forth between the leaues
diuers small stalkes, with foure or fiue flowers on each of them, of
a yellowish greene colour, which turne into small berries, of the
bignesse of blacke Cherries, greene at the first, and red when they
begin to be ripe, but growing blacke if they hang too long vpon the
branches, wherein is contained a hard shell, and a white hard kernell
within it, couered with a yellowish skin. This abideth (as I said
before) with greene leaues as well Winter as Summer; and therefore
fittest to be planted among other of the same nature, to make an euer
greene hedge.


        The Vse of Clusius his Celastrus.

        Being so great a stranger in this part of the Christian world,
        I know none hath made tryall of what property it is, but that
        the taste of the leaues is somewhat bitter.


10. _Pyracantha._   The euer greene Hawthorne, or prickly Corall tree.

This euer greene shrubbe is so fine an ornament to a Garden or Orchard,
either to be noursed vp into a small tree by it selfe, by pruining
and taking away the suckers and vnder branches, or by suffering it to
grow with suckers, thicke and plashing the branches into a hedge, for
that it is plyable to be ordered either way; that I could not but giue
you the knowledge thereof, with the description in this manner. The
younger branches are couered with a smooth darke blewish greene barke,
and the elder with a more ash coloured, thicke set with leaues without
order, some greater and others smaller, somewhat like both in forme and
bignesse vnto the leaues of the Barberry tree, but somewhat larger,
and more snipt about the edges, of a deeper green colour also, and
with small long thornes scattered here & there vpon the branches: the
flowers come forth as well at the ends of the branches, as at diuers
places at the ioynts of the leaues, standing thicke together, of a pale
whitish colour, a little dasht ouer with a shew of blush, consisting
of fiue leaues a peece, with some small threads in the middle, which
turne into berries, very like vnto Hawthorne berries, but much redder
and dryer, almost like polished Corall, wherein are contained foure or
fiue small yellowish white three square seede, somewhat shining. It is
thought to be the _Oxyacantha_ of Dioscorides; but seeing Dioscorides
doth explaine the forme of the leafe in his Chapter of Medlars, which
he concealed in the Chapter of _Oxyacantha_, it cannot be the same: for
_Mespilus Anthedon_ of Theophrastus, or _Aronia_ of Dioscorides, hath
the leafe of _Oxyacantha_, as Dioscorides saith, or of Smalladge, as
Theophrastus, which cannot agree to this Thorne; but doth most liuely
delineate out our white Thorne or Hawthorne, that now there is no
doubt, but that _Oxyacantha_ of Dioscorides is the Hawthorne tree or
bush.

        The Vse of this Corall tree.

        Although Lobel maketh mention of this tree to grow both in
        Italy, and Prouence in France, in some of their hedges, yet
        he saith it is neglected in the naturall places, and to be
        of no vse with them: neither doe I heare, that it is applyed
        to any Physicall vse with vs, but (as I before said) it is
        preserued with diuers as an ornament to a Garden or Orchard, by
        reason of his euer greene leaues, and red berries among them,
        being a pleasant spectacle, and fit to be brought into the
        forme of an hedge, as one please to lead it.


11. _Taxus._   The Yewe tree.

The Yewe tree groweth with vs in many places to bee a reasonable great
tree, but in hoter countries much bigger, couered with a reddish gray
scaly barke; the younger branches are reddish likewise, whereon grow
many winged leaues, that is, many narrow long darke greene leaues,
set on both sides of a long stalke or branch, neuer dying or falling
away, but abiding on perpetually, except it be on the elder boughes:
the flowers are small, growing by the leaues, which turne into round
red berries, like vnto red Asparagus berries, in taste sweetish, with
a little bitternesse, and causing no harme to them for any thing hath
been knowne in our country.


        The Vse of the Yewe tree.

        It is found planted both in the corners of Orchards, and
        against the windowes of Houses, to be both a shadow and an
        ornament, in being alwayes greene, and to decke vp Houses
        in Winter: but ancient Writers haue euer reckoned it to be
        dangerous at the least, if not deadly.


12. _Buxus._   The Boxe tree.

The Boxe tree in some places is a reasonable tall tree, yet growing
slowly; the trunke or body whereof is of the bignesse of a mans thigh,
which is the biggest that euer I saw: but sometimes, and in other
places it groweth much lower, vsually not aboue a yard, or a yard and
a halfe high, on the backe sides of many Houses, and in the Orchards
likewise: the leaues are small, thicke and hard, and still the greater
or lesser the tree is, the greater or lesser are the leaues, round
pointed, and of a fresh shining greene colour: the flowers are small
and greenish, which turne into heads or berries, with foure hornes,
whitish on the outside, and with reddish seede within them.

[Sidenote: _Buxus aureus._ Gilded Boxe.]

There is another kinde hereof but lately come to our knowledge,
which differeth not in any thing from the former, but onely that
all the leaues haue a yellow lift or gard about the edge of them on
the vpperside, and none on the lower, which maketh it seeme very
beautifull; and is therefore called gilded Boxe.

[Sidenote: _Buxus humilis._ Dwarfe Boxe.]

We haue yet another kinde of Boxe, growing small and lowe, not aboue
halfe a foote, or a foote high at the most, vnlesse it be neglected,
which then doth grow a little more shrubby, bearing the like leaues,
but smaller, according to the growth, and of a deeper greene colour:
I could neuer know that this kinde euer bore flower or seede, but is
propagated by slipping the roote, which encreaseth very much.


        The Vse of Boxe.

        The wood of the Boxe tree is vsed in many kindes of small
        works among Turners, because it is hard, close, and firme,
        and as some haue said, the roots much more, in regard of the
        diuers waues and crooked veines running through it. It hath no
        Physicall vse among the most and best Physitians, although some
        haue reported it to stay fluxes, and to be as good as the wood
        of _Guaiacum_, or _Lignum vitæ_ for the French disease. The
        leaues and branches serue both Summer and Winter to decke vp
        houses; and are many times giuen to horses for the bots.

        The lowe or dwarfe Boxe is of excellent vse to border vp a
        knot, or the long beds in a Garden, being a maruailous fine
        ornament thereunto, in regard it both groweth lowe, is euer
        greene, and by cutting may bee kept in what maner euery one
        please, as I haue before spoken more largely.


13. _Sabina._   The Sauine tree or bush.

The Sauine tree or bush that is most vsuall in our country, is a small
lowe bush, not so high as a man in any place, nor so bigge in the
stemme or trunke as a mans arme, with many crooked bending boughes and
branches, whereon are set many small, short, hard, and prickly leaues,
of a darke green colour, fresh and green both Winter and Summer: it is
reported, that in the naturall places it beareth small blacke berries,
like vnto Iuniper, but with vs it was neuer knowne to beare any.


        The Vse of Sauine.

        It is planted in out-yards, backsides, or voide places of
        Orchards, as well to cast clothes thereon to dry, as for
        medicines both for men and horses: being made into an oyle, it
        is good to annoint childrens bellies for to kill the Wormes:
        and the powder thereof mixed with Hogs grease, to annoint the
        running sores or scabs in their heads; but beware how you giue
        it inwardly to men, women, or children. It is often put into
        horses drenches, to helpe to cure them of the bots, and other
        diseases.


14. _Paliurus._   Christs thorne.

This thorny shrubbe (wherewith as it is thought, our Sauiour Christ was
crowned, because as those that haue trauelled through Palestina and
Iudæa, doe report no other thorne doth grow therein so frequent, or so
apt to be writhed) riseth in some places to a reasonable height, but in
our country seldome exceedeth the height of a man, bearing many slender
branches, full of leaues, set on either side thereof one by one, which
are somewhat broad and round, yet pointed, and full of veines, thicke
set also with small thornes, euen at the foote of euery branch, and at
the foote of euery leafe one or two, some standing vpright, others a
little bending downe: the flowers are small and yellow, standing for
the most part at the end of the branches, many growing vpon a long
stalke, which after turne into round, flat, and hard shelly fruit, yet
couered with a soft fleshy skinne, within which are included two or
three hard, small, and browne flat seeds, lying in seuerall partitions.
The leaues hereof fall away euery yeare, and spring forth afresh againe
the next May following. The rarity and beauty of this shrubbe, but
chiefly (as I thinke) the name hath caused this to be much accounted of
with all louers of plants.


        The Vse of Christs thorne.

        Wee haue so few of these shrubbes growing in our country, and
        those that are, doe, for any thing I can vnderstand, neuer
        beare fruit with vs; that there is no other vse made hereof
        then to delight the owners: but this is certainly receiued for
        the _Paliurus_ of Dioscorides and Theophrastus, and thought
        also by Matthiolus to be the very true _Rhamnus tertius_ of
        Dioscorides. Matthiolus also seemeth to contradict the opinion
        is held by the Physitians of Mompelier, and others, that it
        cannot be the _Paliurus_ of Theophrastus. It is held to be
        effectuall to helpe to breake the stone, both in the bladder,
        reines, and kidneyes; the leaues and young branches haue an
        astringent quality, and good against poysons and the bitings of
        serpents.


15. _Larix._   The Larch tree.

The Larch tree, where it naturally groweth, riseth vp to be as tall as
the Pine or Firre tree, but in our Land being rare, and noursed vp but
with a few, and those onely louers of rarities, it groweth both slowly,
and becommeth not high: the barke hereof is very rugged and thicke, the
boughes and branches grow one aboue another in a very comely order,
hauing diuers small yellowish knobs or bunches set thereon at seuerall
distances; from whence doe yearely shoote forth many small, long, and
narrow smooth leaues together, both shorter and smaller, and not so
hard or sharpe pointed as either the Pine or Firre tree leaues, which
doe not abide the Winter as they doe, but fall away euery yeare, as
other trees which shed their leaues, and gaine fresh euery Spring: the
blossomes are very beautifull and delectable, being of an excellent
fine crimson colour, which standing among the greene leaues, allure
the eyes of the beholders to regard it with the more desire: it also
beareth in the naturall places (but not in our Land that I could heare)
small soft cones or fruit, somewhat like vnto Cypresse nuts, when they
are greene and close.


        The Vse of the Larch tree.

        The coles of the wood hereof (because it is so hard and durable
        as none more) is held to be of most force being fired, to cause
        the Iron oare to melt, which none other would doe so well.
        Matthiolus contesteth against Fuchsius, for deeming the Venice
        Turpentine to be the liquid Rossen of the Firre tree, which he
        assureth vpon his owne experience and certaine knowledge, to
        be drawne from this Larch tree, and none other; which cleere
        Turpintine is altogether vsed inwardly, and no other, except
        that of the true Turpintine tree, and is very effectuall to
        cleanse the reines, kidneyes, and bladder, both of grauell
        and the stone, and to prouoke vrine: it is also of especiall
        property for the _gonorrhæa_, or running of the reines, as it
        is called, with some powder of white Amber mixed therewith,
        taken for certaine dayes together. Taken also in an Electuary,
        it is singular good for to expectorate rotten flegme, and to
        helpe the consumption of the lungs. It is vsed in plaisters
        and salues, as the best sort of Turpintine. The Agaricke that
        is vsed in physicke, is taken from the bodies and armes of
        this tree. And Matthiolus doth much insist against Brasauolus,
        that thought other trees had produced Agaricke, affirming them
        to be hard _Fungi_, or Mushroms (such as wee call Touch-wood)
        wherwith many vse to take fire, strooke thereinto from steele.


16. _Tilia._   The Line or Linden tree.

There are two sorts of Line trees, the male and the female; but because
the male is rare to be seene, and the female is more familiar, I will
onely giue you the description of the female, and leaue the other.

The female Line tree groweth exceeding high and great, like vnto an
Elme, with many large spreading boughes, couered with a smooth barke,
the innermost being very plyant and bending from whence come smaller
branches, all of them so plyable, that they may bee led or carried into
any forme you please: the leaues thereon are very faire, broad, and
round, somewhat like vnto Elme leaues, but fairer, smoother, and of a
fresher greene colour, dented finely about the edges, and ending in a
sharpe point: the flowers are white, and of a good smell, many standing
together at the top of a stalke, which runneth all along the middle
ribbe of a small long whitish leafe; after which come small round
berries, wherein is contained small blackish seede: this tree is wholly
neglected by those that haue them, or dwell neere them, because they
suppose it to be fruitlesse, in regard it beareth chaffie huskes, which
in many places fall away, without giuing ripe seede.

]


        The Vse of the Line tree.

        It is planted both to make goodly Arbours, and Summer
        banquetting houses, either belowe vpon the ground, the boughes
        seruing very handsomely to plash round about it, or vp higher,
        for a second aboue it, and a third also: for the more it is
        depressed, the better it will grow. And I haue seene at Cobham
        in Kent, a tall or great bodied Line tree, bare without boughes
        for eight foote high, and then the branches were spread round
        about so orderly, as if it were done by art, and brought to
        compasse that middle Arbour: And from those boughes the body
        was bare againe for eight or nine foote (wherein might bee
        placed halfe an hundred men at the least, as there might be
        likewise in that vnderneath this) & then another rowe of
        branches to encompasse a third Arbour, with stayres made for
        the purpose to this and that vnderneath it: vpon the boughes
        were laid boards to tread vpon, which was the goodliest
        spectacle mine eyes euer beheld for one tree to carry.

        The coles of the wood are the best to make Gunpowder. And being
        kindled, and quenched in vinegar, are good to dissolue clotted
        bloud in those that are bruised with a fall. The inner barke
        being steeped in water yeeldeth a slimie iuyce, which is found
        by experience, to be very profitable for them that haue been
        burnt with fire.


17. _Tamarix._   Tamariske tree.

The Tamariske tree that is common in our country, although in some
places it doth not grow great, yet I haue seene it in some other, to be
as great as a great apple tree in the body, bearing great arms; from
whose smaller branches spring forth young slender red shootes, set
with many very fine, small, and short leaues, a little crisped, like
vnto the leaues of Sauine, not hard or rough, but soft and greene: the
flowers be white mossie threads, which turne into dounie seede, that is
carried away with the winde.

[Sidenote: _Tamariscus solijs albidis._ White Tamariske.]

There is another kinde hereof very beautifull and rare, not to be seene
in this Land I thinke, but with Mʳ. William Ward, the Kings seruant in
his Granary, before remembred, who brought me a small twigge to see
from his house at Boram in Essex, whose branches are all red while they
are young, and all the leaues white, abiding so all the Summer long,
without changing into any shew of greene like the other and so abideth
constant yeare after yeare, yet shedding the leaues in Winter like the
other.


        The Vse of Tamariske.

        The greatest vse of Tamariske is for spleneticke diseases,
        either the leaues or the barke made into drinkes; or the wood
        made into small Cans or Cups to drinke in.


18. _Acer maius latifolium._   The great Maple or Sycomore tree.

The Sycomore tree, as we vsually call it (and is the greatest kind of
Maple, cherished in our Land onely in Orchards, or elsewhere for shade
and walkes, both here in England, and in some other countries also)
groweth quickly to bee a faire spreading great tree, with many Boughes
and branches, whose barke is somewhat smooth: the leaues are very
great, large, and smooth, cut into foure or fiue diuisions, and ending
into so many corners, euery one standing on a long reddish stalke:
the bloomings are of a yellowish green colour, growing many together
on each side of a long stalke, which after turne into long and broad
winged seede, two alwaies standing together on a stalke, and bunched
out in the middle, where the seed or kernell lyeth, very like vnto the
common Maple growing wilde abroad, but many more together, and larger.


        The Vse of the Sycomore tree.

        It is altogether planted for shady walkes, and hath no other
        vse with vs that I know.


19. _Nux Vesicaria._   The bladder Nut.

This tree groweth not very high, but is of a meane stature, when it is
preserued and pruined to grow vpright, or else it shooteth forth many
twigges from the rootes, and so is fit to plant in a hedge rowe, as it
is vsed in some places: the body and armes are couered with a whitish
greene barke: the branches and leaues on them are like vnto the Elder,
hauing three or fiue leaues set one against another, with one of them
at the end, each whereof is nicked or dented about the edges: the
flowers are sweete and white, many growing together on a long stalke,
hanging downeward, in forme resembling a small Daffodill, hauing a
small round cup in the middle, and leaues about it: after which come
the fruit, inclosed in russetish greene bladders, containing one or
two brownish nuts, lesser then Hasell nuts, whose outer shell is not
hard and woody, like the shell of a nut, but tough, and hard withall,
not easie to breake, within which is a greene kernell, sweetish at the
first, but lothsome afterwards, ready to procure casting, and yet liked
of some people, who can well endure to eate them.


        The Vse of the Bladder Nut.

        The greatest vse that I know the tree or his fruit is put vnto,
        is, that it is receiued into an Orchard, either for the rarity
        of the kinde, being suffered to grow into a tree, or (as I said
        before) to make an hedge, being let grow into suckers.

        Some Quacksaluers haue vsed these nuts as a medicine of rare
        vertue for the stone, but what good they haue done, I neuer yet
        could learne.


20. _Rhus Myrtifolia._   The Mirtle leafed Sumach.

This lowe shrubbe groweth seldome to the height of a man, hauing
many slender branches, and long winged leaues set thereon, euery one
whereof is of the bignesse of the broad or large Mirtle leafe, and set
by couples all the length of the ribbe, running through the middle of
them. It beareth diuers flowers at the tops of the branches, made of
many purple threads, which turne into small blacke berries, wherein
are contained small, white, and rough seed, somewhat like vnto Grape
kernels or stones. This vseth to dye down to the ground in my Garden
euery Winter, and rise vp again euery Spring, whether the nature
thereof were so, or the coldnesse of our climate the cause thereof, I
am not well assured. It is also rare, and to be seen but with a few.


        The Vse of this Sumach.

        It is vsed to thicken or tanne leather or hides, in the same
        manner that the ordinary Sumach doth; as also to stay fluxes
        both in men and women.


21. _Rhus Virginiana._
The Virginia Sumach, or Buckes horne tree of Virginia.

This strange tree becommeth in some places to bee of a reasonable
height and bignesse, the wood whereof is white, soft, and pithy in
the middle, like vnto an Elder, couered with a darke coloured barke,
somewhat smooth: the young branches that are of the last yeares growth
are somewhat reddish or browne, very soft and smooth in handling,
and so like vnto the Veluet head of a Deere, that if one were cut off
from the tree, and shewed by it selfe, it might soone deceiue a right
good Woodman, and as they grow seeme most like thereunto, yeelding a
yellowish milke when it is broken, which in a small time becommeth
thicke like a gumme: the leaues grow without order on the branches, but
are themselues set in a seemly order on each side of a middle ribbe,
seuen, nine, ten, or more on a side, and one at the end, each whereof
are somewhat broad and long, of a darke greene colour on the vpperside,
and paler greene vnderneath, finely snipped or toothed round about the
edges: at the ends of the branches come forth long and thicke browne
tufts, very soft, and as it were woolly in handling, made all of short
threads or thrums; from among which appeare many small flowers, much
more red or crimson then the tufts, which turne into a very small
seede: the roote shooteth forth young suckers farre away, and round
about, whereby it is mightily encreased.


        The Vse of this Sumach.

        It is onely kept as a rarity and ornament to a Garden or
        Orchard, no bodie, that I can heare of, hauing made any tryall
        of the Physicall properties.


22. _Vitis, seu potius Hedera Virginensis._
The Virginia Vine, or rather Iuie.

This slender, but tall climing Virginia Vine (as it was first called;
but Iuie, as it doth better resemble) riseth out of the ground with
diuers stems, none much bigger then a mans thumbe, many lesse; from
whence shoote forth many long weake branches, not able to stand
vpright, vnlesse they be sustained: yet planted neere vnto a wall or
pale, the branches at seuerall distances of the leaues will shoote
forth small short tendrels, not twining themselues about any thing, but
ending into foure, fiue, or six, or more small short and somewhat broad
clawes, which will fasten like a hand with fingers so close thereunto,
that it will bring part of the wall, morter, or board away with it, if
it be pulled from it, and thereby stay it selfe, to climbe vp to the
toppe of the highest chimney of a house, being planted thereat: the
leaues are crumpled, or rather folded together at the first comming
forth, and very red, which after growing forth, are very faire, large,
and greene, diuided into foure, fiue, six, or seuen leaues, standing
together vpon a small foote-stalke, set without order on the branches,
at the ends whereof, as also at other places sometime, come forth
diuers short tufts of buds for flowers; but we could neuer see them
open themselues, to shew what manner of flower it would be, or what
fruit would follow in our country: the roote spreadeth here and there,
and not very deepe.


        The Use of this Virginian.

        We know of no other vse, but to furnish a Garden, and to
        encrease the number of rarities.


And thus haue I finished this worke, and furnished it with whatsoeuer
Art and Nature concurring, could effect to bring delight to those
that liue in our Climate, and take pleasure in such things; which how
well or ill done, I must abide euery ones censure: the iudicious and
courteous I onely respect, let Momus bite his lip, and eate his heart;
and so Farewell.

Transcriber’s Note

Frontispiece--The Tetragrammaton (ְיֹהָוה) is printed within the
sun at the top of the image of the Garden of Eden. The text in the
frontispiece had some characters which were difficult to make out, the
transcription given above for the frontispiece is our best attempt.

On page 299 in “The Names” section, “usually” is left as
printed. “Saluia” is sometimes printed as “Salvia” and “maior” as
“major”. The word “fœmina” is often printed “fæmina”.

In the indexes the letter “v” is sometimes used where a “u” is used
in the body of the book. Similarly “e” or even “œ” is sometimes used in
the index where an “æ” is used in the body of the book. Some pairs of
characters, “ct” “st” and “sh” were originally printed as ligatures.

The main divisions of the book started with a decoration, and an
illustrated capital letter, they also sometimes ended with a
decoration.

There is no chapter CX. and there are two chapters CXXXI. in “The
Garden of pleasant Flowers”.

In the illustration on page 505, there is no corresponding caption for
label 8.

Numbered lists of plants, in Latin and English, were originally printed
with the Latin on the left, and English on the right. These are here
shown one under the other.


Changes made to the text are:

Greek-Ligatures in quotations from the Greek have been expanded, and
accents and punctuation have been corrected.

An abbreviation, printed as a lowercase g with a comma above and a
cedilla after, has been represented by “q.” throughout. The ligature
“ȣ”, has been expanded to “ου” throughout.

Punctuation has been standardized in ordered lists, headings, indexes
and the “Faults escaped in some Copies”. Numbered sections have had
the occasional misnumbering corrected, and the occasional irregular
indentation standardized.

italics, unitalicized indexed words have been left as printed.

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
